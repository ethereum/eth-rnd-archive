It can be applied before the next block or slot or right after the payload is received -- whatever is better from the performance and design PoV",

        "content": "The reason to do this with the payload is simplicity, otherwise you need to lock and check on the CL block. Take for example withdrawals in the current 7732 spec: you process them on the CL block instead, and then you need to record the withdrawals root on the CL state and check later that the EL payload satisfies them. You avoid that commitment in the state by processing them directly with the payload.",

As such, the CL no longer keeps the `ExecutionPayloadHeader`s around on disk and thus the *usual* flow of reconstructing full `ExecutionPayload`s by marrying `ExecutionPayloadHeader` + `ExecutionPayloadBody` (retrieved from `engine_getPayloadBodiesBy*`) no longer works",
