The entire point of MaxEB was that you generally want equal stake for committees. \n\n2. Using a hypergeometric distribution calculator, I can’t arrive at the number in the EIP: 35% of malicious stake can’t control the PTC. I think you would need 75% honest nodes to always have 67% in the PTC, using PTC size of 512. \n\nAm I missing something?",
