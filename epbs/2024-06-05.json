        "content": "I was preparing for a pitch at flashbots and then it hit me that we never make the obvious statement explicit. People often argue that proposers may go off-protocol and continue doing the \"trusted Mev Boost\" way of things. This may be actually true,  but actually ePBS makes this **very hard**. The reason being that while the in-protocol system gives every player at the very least 6 seconds to execute the payload (and actually in the usual happy case attesters get almost 11 seconds to execute it) if you continue using Mev Boost then the relay has to execute the block and do the extra hops of communications all in less than the required time to broadcast the CL block and have it attested at 3 seconds. This is not **a mere 1 extra hop** as I have been claiming, this requires several extra roundtrips and puts the relay at a disadvantage by having to perform a full block validation vs the in-protocol path.",

        "content": "Yea definetly. Besides that, off-protocol shenanigans are highly attributable. The builder's identity is on-chain, and payment is on-chain. I doubt any attributable party will attempt this, except perhaps a small anonymous validator or a vertically integrated validator and builder. You would also need to fork the client code, and there are constant headwinds. That's why I haven't convinced myself that off-protocol actions will become a reality.",
