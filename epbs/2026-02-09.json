If that is fine I will open a separate one for the validator guide that may be contentious about the proposer honest behavior being that it needs to reorg such payloads.",

    "content": "Yes this would be fine, except for this \"Implemnetations MAY return `True` if the node have recovered all the blob data\", which still shouldn't be the case for attesters (I commented on the PR as to why)\n\nThe proposer behavior is imo to be specified separately, and for example could look like:\n- do not extend the payload if < 25% votes for either data availability or payload timeliness, or if not locally available and valid\n- extend otherwise\n\nThis way, you only extend blocks that were timely and which are actually available, even if you yourself cannot fully verify the availability. And you could leave implementations the choice to have the full custody proposer behavior be instead:\n- do not extend the payload if < 25% votes for payload timeliness, or if not locally available and valid\n- extend otherwise\n\nIn other words, a full custody proposer would not care if the data is late, as long as it gets all of it locally. It would only listen to the PTC for the payload timeliness part (to ensure that it doesn't come very late and leaves no time to build a block). Basically, the proposer behavior would follow the note above, \"return `True` if the node have recovered all the blob data\", but attesters wouldn't",

    "content": "I agree about the DA timeliness needing to be there but specifying it in an executable way is incredibly tricky. I do not know how to do that. If you have a suggestion or if just changing the wording in this function I am fine with it, but I don't think we can (or should if we could) make it executable. \n\nAs for the proposer: I think if the proposer is not a super node it should not extend the payload if less than 50% of the PTC (or probably higher) voted for not available. But let's get to that one later in a separate PR, I want to merge this one. So if I change the wording on this PR, in that docstring to mention that clients should return true from that call if they had received all the data before the PTC deadline and then leave the proposer's behavior to the `validator.md` file in a different PR, would that be OK? I don't know how to do this otherwise",
