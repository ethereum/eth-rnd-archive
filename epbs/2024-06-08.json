I think that this is still the case even when requests are included into the execution payload. This is because a proposer has to apply them to compute the state root for the blinded beacon block",

        "content": "I'm not sure why these must be processed during the consensus phase if they are included in the header. In ePBS, consensus and execution are pipelined. This means there will be a post-consensus state root and a post-execution state root. So what does it mean if they are in the header?\n\n- The CL client already caches the header in the beacon state. The ePBS beacon state has a modified field `execution_payload_header`.\n- Once the builder reveals the `execution_payload`, the CL client can process the payload and update the beacon state where the payload was hidden (coudln't be processed at consensus phase). The CL client needs to verify `htr(payload.object) == header.root`.\n- For such objects, consensus processing is deferred until the execution phase.\n- Having the objects in the header is better than in the block body because builders don't need to gossip these objects over bid.",
