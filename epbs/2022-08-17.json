What that means then is that a builder at slot 2n+3 which does not comply with the crList from the previous proposer (the one from slot 2n) can have their block voted out of the fork-choice. \nThe reason to have the list be made by the previous proposer (rather than the one from 2n+2, I.e. the one which has chosen this builder) is that this way there is 0 reason to not make a crList or to be careful about what you put in it, at least in terms of profits (of course you might be worried  about legal repercussions of making a certain kind of list, but we can’t do anything to prevent that)",
