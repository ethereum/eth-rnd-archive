        "content": "Thinking about it more, relays should probably also set `--disable-proposer-reorgs` for Lighthouse. I think the payload attributes sent at the start of the slot should be sufficient for building upon the parent block (performing a re-org). Without the flag Lighthouse will completely suppress payload attributes for late blocks, which could cause non-reorg-enabled clients to miss out on a bid\n\ne.g. in this scenario:\n\n- on-time block at slot N\n- late block at slot N + 1\n- proposing at N + 2\n\nLighthouse by default will not send payload attributes for N + 2 building on N + 1. With `--prepare-payload-lookahead 12000` set it will send payload attributes for N + 2 on N, at the start of slot N + 1. With re-orgs disabled it will send payload attributes for N + 2 on N + 1, once N + 1 arrives",
