        "content": "So there are three options as far as I can see:\n1. No signature at all.\n2. One signature for all, that is the proposer identifies himself. \n3. One signature per request, that is the proposer identifies himself and the target builder. \n\n1. Allows anyone to request from anyone even before the proposer has\n2. Allows anyone to request from anyone but only after receiving one actual request from the proposer. \n3. Protects builders and they know they are only getting a request from the proposer. \n\nIf 1 is fine for builders that's definitely the simplest for us to implement. \n\nIf 2 is a good compromise it would make it simpler for us. There's some reason to believe it could be a good compromise cause in the happy case the proposer will be directly connected to the builder and the extra hop needed for other builders to reuse the request may kill this attack already (assuming builders have good connections to proposers). \n\n3 may not be so bad, I don't really know of benchmarks of this, my intuition may be wrong in thinking that it's too expensive. As you mentioned, these can be done fairly in advance of the slot on a quiet time. \n\nAt anyrate, these are definitely not consensus breaking and most probably we can rollout 1, then move to 2 or 3 with a simple release change and no need to coordinate this.",
