On the one hand it makes it simpler to reason for us to get attestations for known forkchoice statuses. On the other hand these attestations are useful to discern between two different consensus blocks branches, even if we do not know the payload status. \n\nPerhaps this PR makes things strictly worse by losing those votes, but wanted to raise this none-the-less before I refactor our code to be able to count these without knowing the payload status.",

    "content": "But for Prysm it would be **a lot** simpler to ignore these attestations. The reason is that we keep track of the \"balance\" that voted for each node directly in the node, and then we propagate back to the ancestry these balances to compute the *weight* in the usual spec meaning. If we have to count these attestations we would have to do a deep change since there's no node to add to this \"balance\"",
