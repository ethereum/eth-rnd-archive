On the one hand it makes it simpler to reason for us to get attestations for known forkchoice statuses. On the other hand these attestations are useful to discern between two different consensus blocks branches, even if we do not know the payload status. \n\nPerhaps this PR makes things strictly worse by losing those votes, but wanted to raise this none-the-less before I refactor our code to be able to count these without knowing the payload status.",
