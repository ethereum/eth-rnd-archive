I am looking for feedback or anyone that plans to implement the validator client for ePBS. Please take a look. Thank you.",

It seems to be more about whether clients plan to implement a builder than whether we plan to support proposer requesting from a builder out of band. From a solo validator's perspective, I think we should support it. I don't think we'll implement an actual builder client. Supporting it from a solo validator's perspective, as potuz mentioned, is straightforward:\n- Retrieve the payload from the local EL client and convert it into a header.\n- Insert the header into the block body, sign it, and broadcast the beacon block.\n- Broadcast the payload immediately after the block.",
