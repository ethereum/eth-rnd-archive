After talking with different affected parties, it seems that one of the worst disruptions of 7732 for them is on the accounting. Payments being made in the CL breaks many setups. I have a middle ground proposal that attenuates a bit this situation. The simplest one is to pay with a withdrawal. The second one which is a little more involved is to add a fee recipient in the bid and then pay with a withdrawal to that fee recipient. This may require a little more change but it seems to be simple enough and will disrupt minimally existing setups. I know most affected players aren't in this channel but perhaps we could call some to show up in the breakout?",
