Specifically, will multiple bids be allowed and will cancellations be allowed via this channel? I know that P2P channel is public one bid first price auction, but I have not found any decisions like that for the private RPC channel. Cheers!",

If the proposer requests again another bid, the builder cannot trust it that it will cancel the first one, since it's already signed.",
