There are a ton of edge cases and if you look at the commit history for `forkchoice.md` in the PR you'll find some horrible bugs. I am sure it's still riddled with them, but I think that should be open for review now. I don't have space to add a link to it in the previous document, but I updated the previous design doc https://hackmd.io/@potuz/rJ9GCnT1C with a few corrections thanks to Terence that found some typos and also I added some comments regarding the percentages of the collusion attacks. While they seem to be on the low side (attackers need to hold only 20% of the stake) the attacks themselves at those levels are rather useless. An ex-anti attack for example requires that you publish your payload before, so you can't really exploit the payload of your victim. If you want to withhold the payload as well, then we are back to the isual thresholds. Something similar happens for post-anti reorgs. \n\ncc \u003c@361447803194441738\u003e to compare to your forkchoice doc. Also please \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e if you get any chance to look into these documents I'd greatly appreciate it. \n\nThat's it for me for a while, will now concentrate on purely coding",
