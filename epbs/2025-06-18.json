This will change attestation counting, we would keep the participation flags untouched, just that timely head now will be obtained by voting for the right CL head or the payload included in that right CL head. The advantage of this change is that it does not touch forkchoice at all (besides of course the unavoidable having to deal with the trees of full and empty nodes)",
