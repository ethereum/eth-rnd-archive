I assume it would be set to true, if the validator part of the PTC commitee has sampled all the columns required by it? Basically set to true if `is_data_available(signed_beacon_block)` (https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/specs/fulu/fork-choice.md?plain=1#L22) returns true?",

We want both conditions to return `True` to return `True`, but currently in the pseudo-code, we only need **one of the two** conditions to return `True` because of the `or`  keyword being used.",

I think that's right, just that we added the extra boolean when we rebased on top of Fulu and we didn't specify how to do that cause at that time it was merging with \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e's changes and I didn't want to interfere. I think it's fine to merge that PR, the only caveat to which I would want to delay merging it (or we should open the discussion later) is when we actually do include the timelines. As far as I understand the expected setup is that we will have two different deadlines, one for the payload and one for the data availability. We want to set the payload to true only when it's been seen before the first deadline and the data to true only if it's passed validation (we may want to always use the same deadline for DA than to submit the PTC attestaiton, or have formally two different one and set them equal). I think we need to include this language eventually and that's probably why we never merged anything in that area",
