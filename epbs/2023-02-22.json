Looking at your Prysm fork it looks like you've added gRPC endpoints for getting payload attributes (although I don't see withdrawals)?\n\nI'm looking at adding a push-based publishing of payload attributes to Lighthouse, with a CLI flag to enable publishing on every slot as well as each fcU. Would this be useful for builders and relays prior to Capella on mainnet? I've described a bit more of my thinking here: \u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/issues/244#issuecomment-1439293791\u003e",
