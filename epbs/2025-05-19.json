Or is there some additional computation that needs to be done?",

In the MeV boost pipeline it's already provided by the builder and yes, this is what goes on that field. And in the local construction, you get this field from the local El block",

My approach seems to match what you're saying.\n\nfor previous forks in Nimbus, there is a `compute_execution_block_hash` function that calculates the execution block hash from the full payload by converting it to an EthHeader and computing its RLP hash. hence my question",
