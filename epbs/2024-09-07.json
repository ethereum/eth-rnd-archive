I'm actually inclined to do this with withdrawals and only didn't do it because I'm lazy to change the spec once more\n\nFor 2, there's no possible application for proving something in the EVM before a Payload. So even in the event of slashings, it's useless/impossible to relay this information to a contract that won't be executed. Information that is accumulated in the state can be proven immediately even after a few empty slots. Information that was in the beacon block but isn't stored in the state can be proven via the blockroots slice in the state so I don't think there's anything missed here. \n\n3 I disagree, the Payload comes with a new CL state commitment as it's itself a cl state transition (albeit a light one) so these should be processed synchronously with the Payload. \n\nCL processing of these can be delayed since anyway these aren't attested. We could even avoid the state root commitment presumably and just enforce it in the next block, I haven't thought about this optimization yet cause I'm not scared of the extra hashing here, but if people are I can put some thought into polishing this part of the design",
