If Francesco's PR passes tests it may be a better option because it is simpler to reason about these sort of tests that were testing purely block weights... we will add anyway actual gloas FC tests to deal with the payload available/unavailable nature of the tree. But just in case I think now my PR will be green at least for the gloas fork",
