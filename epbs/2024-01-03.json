        "content": "Hello, I am trying to write my case for in-protocol builders and looking to gather hard numbers on something. Tried DMing Dankrad but didn't succeed (probably the season). I'd like to know what's the take on local building on the Ethereum long run. The only numbers I could find were on the original proposal for Danksharding https://notes.ethereum.org/@dankrad/new_sharding with a benchmark for KZG proof generation at ~1\"  on a 32-64 Core processor. I'd like to know if proof generation, uptime bandwidth, etc, is still the bottleneck after Danksharding or not. Most importantly, I would like to understand if it's commonly accepted or not that local building **will not** be possible on consumer hardware as currently targeted in the PoS change. \n\nI'm not trying to argue for or against it, just that one of the bad features in the flavour of ePBS that I like precludes single home stakers from locally building their blocks. This is much easier to argue for if this is anyway bound to happen in Ethereum.",
