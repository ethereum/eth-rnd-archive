        "content": "I started working on P2P verification for the builder's bid. Here are some questions I'll explore tomorrow:\n\n- The P2P spec rejects a builder if they are slashed, but the state transition doesn’t check for that. Is there a disparity here?\n- We don’t want a slashed builder to transfer value out through the execution payload header, but what about an inactive builder? As a builder, I might not want to perform any validator duties, so I could initiate an exit. While in the exit queue, I could still perform builder duties regularly. Does this create an issue?\n- Should we require a minimum builder balance?\n- The P2P spec checks for the parent block hash but doesn’t check for the parent block root. Was this missed?",
