Regarding removing execution payload and others from [BeaconBlockBody](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/_features/eip7732/beacon-chain.md#beaconblockbody), can we hardcode a trivial value to these fields instead? Similar to how we hardcode `attestation.data.index` to 0 in EIP-7549? Asking because it poses a challenge in Lodestar's codebase as we assume container fields are append-only",

        "content": "It's more how we define container types in Lodestar. For example, we define electra.Attestation to have extra `committee_bits` field. Then our type system automatically assumes any Attestation in post-electra forks to have `committee_bits` field. \n\nHere we break this assumption, and would either need to make an exception to this or redesign our type system. I wonder if other clients would encounter this issue.\n\nI also think there is no precedent of removing fields from existed container in the spec, and I am curious if some argument were presented that lead us to opt for setting `attestation.data.index` to 0 instead of removing that field for 7549.",
