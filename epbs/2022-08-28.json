I have a somewhat technical question, and I hope this is a proper channel for asking it.\nI have been looking into ethereum block serialization, and I didn't quite understand, why is `mixHash` included in the header? It is an intermediate result of Hashimoto function during PoW validation, so why is it necessary?\nI read that some light clients are using it for a sanity check, not to get ddosed, but I could not find any such checks in `geth` implementation.",
