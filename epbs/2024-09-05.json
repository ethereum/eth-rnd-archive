The practical outcome of it is not every beacon block root will be available in the EVM -- it is to be figured out if it breaks anything, but should not to my opinion. Do you have any other broken invariants on your mind?",

Events triggered from CL, not consumed in EL (e.g., whether a validator is slashed or not)\n3. Events triggered from EL but consumed in CL (e.g., new electra requests)\n\nI do worry about scenario 2. What happens if a validator is slashed, but EL doesn't learn about it for a while due to the nature of an empty slot? Today, this can't happen because it would be a skipped slot",
