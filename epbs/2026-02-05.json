When doing optimistic sync, catching up and removing up to the LVH because of receiving an INVALID with a non-trivial LVH from the EL, removing nodes in forkchoice may be a problem. Previously it would remove the full node containing the payload, now it needs to traverse removing all children (both empty and full) from the full node, but leave the empty node that contained the payload commitment and should **not** remove descendants of this node.",
