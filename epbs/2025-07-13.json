If so, will it be easier to keep it based on Electra or would you rather implement the version on top of Fulu? Since forkchoice is not consensus critical and we can test in the happy path anyway, I'm happy to merge these changes, release static testsvectors and spectests ( \u003c@363800010518822915\u003e  already built a lot of them) and start implementing on Prysm. But if we do, then it'd be good to schedule a breakout. Hard part is timing it",
