I am not certain of tradeoffs here. Potential problems can be the fact that the balances may continue changing on the beacon chain and that the builder code will have to perform more complex operations, but still it feels like probably a good change. I'll add this to the agenda for next Friday, will probably open the EIP anyway with the current mechanism if the coauthors agree.",
