If a builder is slashed, we [can pull from the builders balance](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/daef46377cb5926af7d729fd533cbadc73fda117/specs/gloas/beacon-chain.md?plain=1#L785-L790), not just its excess balance. I've complained before that penalties could result in less-than-expected payments to proposers. I wouldn't say there's a missing check in `process_builder_pending_payments` though, unless I'm misunderstanding something.",
