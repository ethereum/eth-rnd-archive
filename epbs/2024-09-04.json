        "content": "I see two things here:\n1) Revert `headBlock` from `0xD` to `0xB`\n2) Associate `parentBeaconBlock` with a different EL block\n\nBoth are fine from the Engine API perspective. (1) can happen today because of late block reorgs (2) is fine as well. \n\nSo, there are three possibilities for the EL block `0xF` built in slot 102:\n`0xB \u003c- 0xF_1 (parentBeaconBlock=0xC)`\n`0xD \u003c- 0xF_2 (parentBeaconBlock=0xC)`\n`0xB \u003c- 0xF_3 (parentBeaconBlock=0xA)`\n\nAnd every time this block will have different `block_hash`. Enshrining beacon block root into EL block has a nice side effect here, otherwise, blocks `0xF_1` and `0xF_3` could be identical while they would sit in different places wrt beacon block tree.",
