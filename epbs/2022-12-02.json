These types enforce a standard-compliant encoding, which the current Prysm versions fails at. Updating mev-boost or the relay without the Prysm fix would lead to Prysm users running into decoding errors and possibly missing slots (failing getPayload). Therefore we're asking Prysm to mark their next release as required, in order to get faster adoption of the fixed encodings, which would allow to safely rollout the changes to mev-boost and the relays.",
