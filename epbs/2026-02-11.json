But how do we know whether builder has revealed payload for this block or not? Blindly call `ExecutionPayloadEnvelopesByRoot`?",

The following *must* be tested or it will be a consensus split: but if the payload is INVALID, the chain **MUST** continue building on top of the  empty slot, the CL block is still valid. This situation of removing full nodes but not necessarily the empty ones is actually very tricky for optimistic sync and this was essentially all of the complication for me in forkchoice, so I want to stress this since this has come up also as a mistake in reviews. This is also a little hard to catch on testing cause nodes behave differently when syncing optimistically than when catching invalid blocks over gossip.",
