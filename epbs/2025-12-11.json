        "content": "Hey \u003c@592004585506340885\u003e another issue for the breakout (apologies that I send work your way constantly). Builders seem to be aligned that they would prefer to avoid the deposit churn than to receive rewards from performing duties. This is a reasonable request that actually makes the spec easier to reason about. However, we don't want to lose the fallback of P2P bids from actual validators (that's what actually removes the retirement of self building and that's what will make the auction healthier by having already existing entities sending bids). I think this is a reasonable ask from builders and we should see how invasive of a design it would be. Adding another non-validator builder slice to the state shouldn't be much of an issue. Having both mechanisms in place would be perhaps too complicated.

In terms of state size, it seems to me that it's no worse than status quo because anyway we're forced to keep track of every deposit due to how the deposit contract works (we don't want to burn money so we have no real limits). However I wonder if this would be a problem on p2p, if there are too many potential bids (tbf same problem with 32 ETH, just magnified here)",
