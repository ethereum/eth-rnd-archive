Wondering if someone has already had to deal with this?\n\nSomething that's not very clear to me is, wouldn't you have the same exact problem if someone sent you a block or an attestation for a branch you don't know, so that you can't figure out if the signer was actually a proposer/attester on that branch? Is this worse because it can happen on the canonical branch?",
