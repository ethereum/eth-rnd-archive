        "content": "Just wondering if anyone has passed all minimal operations tests? I recall vaguely that Teku has is that right \u003c@993802539856314398\u003e ? I am failing some tests on beta.2, and they can be categorized into 3 types:\n\n~~`process_execution_bid`:\nEg. `process_execution_payload_bid_valid_self_build`\n\nReceive a valid self build bid for slot 1 with builder_index=14, pass all validations, suppose to update `state.builder_pending_payments[9].withdrawal.builder_index` to 14, but spec test expects that to be 0. Spec test also expects `state.latest_execution_payload_bid` to be updated, which is correct.~~\n\n~~`process_attestation`:\nEg. `correct_attestation_included_at_max_inclusion_slot`\n\nState is at slot 15, receive an attestation for slot 0 from 4 attesters. `state.previous_epoch_participation` is all 0s. Suppose to update payment's weight (`state.builder_pending_payments[0].weight`) to be 4 * 32000000000 = 128000000000, but spec test expects that to be 0. ~~\n\n~~`process_payload_attestation`\nEg. `process_payload_attestation_payload_present`\n\nThis one I am not so sure as I get invalid signature. Most likely it's a bug on my side, maybe PTC is calculated wrong, I would need to investigate more. Just putting this here and see if other has the same issue.~~",
