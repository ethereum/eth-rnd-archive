This design makes it easier to adopt and implement*(compared to ePBS). \nit is a bit contradictory for community members like myself, that are not familiar with the deeper technical details. can we please get some further clarification here?",

        "content": "Yes I think this is a direct disagreement in the complexity of the protocol among the authors of the two EIPs. I think a clear indication that 7886 is more complicated is that\n- it involves changes in both layers\n- it doesn't separate the block validation of both layers so it keeps this tech debt \n- interaction with other features is much harder: eg FOCIL is trivial on ePBS and hard on 7886. This is due to the previous point",
