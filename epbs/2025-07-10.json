        "content": "Hello, I've opened the PR to update the specs, this is the minimal change that it is needed to unlock implementations to continue.  This does not include simplifications to Forkchoice, Francesco has a branch with those. It also doesn' t rebase on top of Fulu. That I don't really know if it should come earlier or later than Francesco' s PR since forkchoice will depend on DA, I' m happy to start working on rebasing but don' t want to make also Francesco' s life harder. Awaiting instructions. \n\nIf you guys signal here that you are looking into this PR I'll open a breakout for next Friday to discuss. https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4438",
