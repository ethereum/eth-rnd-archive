After reviewing \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e's forkchoice doc once more, I realized that the changes are minimal to none (essentially no changes to forkchoice as in the current PR other than removing the boosts). There's one tiny issue with accounting for attestations to previous blocks which I believe Francesco and I have different notions. I'll describe the proposal to add the queue for payment processing and block participation and refunding to the builder in case of lack of votes. If the changes seem fine, I'll open the CL-spec PR immediately. \n\nAgenda: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1359\nZoom: https://ethereumfoundation.zoom.us/j/87569210985?pwd=3Cv1hDh7If4cq9IMXvNln1CtqQ72MR.1#success",

        "content": "I am incredibly stupid that I forgot to mention this discrepancy between Francesco's document and what I will open in the CL spec: \n\nI do not want to change the attestation type. So when a validator attests for a block root R, it fixes the whole ancestry of R, regardless if R is empty or full, This is different in Francesco's doc cause in Francesco's doc, if the attestation is for a slot higher than the one that R was included in, then the attestation should decide between R full or R empty. I am not making this difference, this is to not change the attestation type and to not use the PTC of the slot of R to decide this. This way the change to the spec is actually minimal since the current forkchoice already behaves exactly as I am describing.",
