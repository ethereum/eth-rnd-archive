        "content": "I was under the impression that revealing proposer IP was a big deal. Can someone confirm? \n\nYes, relays currently have the same interactions with proposers, but that’s different from the ePBS setting because relays are small in number and explicitly trusted by node operators whereas builders are supposed to be able to join permissionlessly\n\nThe absence of IP protection is relevant for two reasons:\n* could be a security issue with DoS being the biggest concern (Id imagine)\n* many (or at least me) have not considered designs which reveal the proposer IP. I actually had an idea shot down because of the IP leak problem. If we do allow ourselves to use a design that exposes proposer IP (or has some other way of dealing with it), then I don’t know if the full design space has been well explored.",
