I implemented the first happy base case which covers the following:\n` blk \u003c- payload \u003c- blk \u003c- payload`\nI was able to generate the following:\n- anchor state that is eip7732 compatible\n- anchor block that is eip7732 compatible\n- signed block with header\n- signed execution payload envelope\n\nand they get inserted `on_block` and `on_execution_payload` to pass\n```\nls\nanchor_block.ssz_snappy                                                             execution_payload_envelope_0076c589.ssz_snappy\nanchor_state.ssz_snappy                                                             execution_payload_envelope_9e6ae243.ssz_snappy\nblock_0x678be1fd3ac55f4127302a67e78dd7b2353deae26f9194c6f38585d0e9ffc4a2.ssz_snappy meta.yaml\nblock_0xbd746d9b5139509da912acc584a9b8ebc19924052b652f74778d12dc8da41505.ssz_snappy steps.yaml\n```\nin `steps.yaml`, we also made sure `{execution_payload: execution_payload_envelope_9e6ae243, valid: true}`  exist\n\nI think the next productive step is to document all the fork choice test cases we want and we can tackle them one by one. I magine this will get complicated once we add pay load attestation into the mix\n\nreference: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4489/files",

        "content": "I've opened a draft PR that demonstrates how FOCIL can rebase onto ePBS. Can ePBS folks review it? Doesn't have to be a full review, just wanted to know if the proposed changes make sense. I think `is_inclusion_list_satisfied_block` and `is_inclusion_list_satisfied_payload` are key changes.\n\nThere are few things that deserve discussions but I arbitrarily chose one viable option just as a demonstration purpose. The main idea are two prongs:\n- For a beacon block, attesters check if it passes the IL bitlist inclusivity check and extends IL compliant payload, if the parent node was full.\n- For an execution payload, validators just rely on the engine API and mark whether the payload is IL compliant or not. The result is used during attestation.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4493",
