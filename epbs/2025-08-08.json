On the ePBS testing front, me and \u003c@600991921275535360\u003e were thinking about extending our FC compliance suite with the FC changes introduced by the ePBS. And now when ePBS is SFIed it makes sense to start thinking towards this direction. Integrating the suite requires additional but manageable engineering efforts from client teams, but it will give a good test coverage and confidence (Alex recently managed to generate 1M tests) before mainnet.",
