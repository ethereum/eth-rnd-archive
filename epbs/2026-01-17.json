        "content": "While the dual deadline improves scaling, I think Francesco's framing is reasonable: this is about further improving scaling while staying at a safe distance from attack vectors. Think of this idea as introducing \"wiggle room\" to where the optimal deadline in ePBS is situated, https://ethresear.ch/t/the-glamsterdam-equation/22760#p-55351-epbs-5 . A block that consumes a lot of calldata gas will spend more time on propagation and less gas on execution, thus requiring a longer propagation window and a shorter execution window, and vice versa.\n\nThe \"optimal deadline\" is thus variable.",
