I’m genuinely eager to contribute and gain a deeper understanding of the problem space. I'd love to set up a quick chat or meeting if you're available!",

I've been saying that we can use the trick of counting attestations and remove the boosts from the current forkchoice implementation. This note analyzes that. But perhaps we can go a little forward and implement exactly what \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e had designed if we allow attestations be for blocks or for payloads. I was scared at first but now it doesn't seem too much of a lift. Would appreciate an evaluation from client devs \u003c@641548687813902336\u003e \u003c@554799849288105986\u003e",
