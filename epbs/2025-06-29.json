I am working on the CL-specs and I want to make everybody's lives easier. \u003c@592004585506340885\u003e would it be better for you if I directly open a PR against Fulu (this will include a rebase of the current status of 7732) or would you rather two of them, one for Electra with the core changes (except some that explicitly depend on DA) and another one with the rebase to Fulu?\n\n\u003c@520034910149410861\u003e would you rather push to my branch or would you rather merge first your forkchoice changes and I rebase on top of that? I belive DA plays a role in forkchoice anyway so the answer to the previous question also matters to you. \n\nI am happy to do whatever you guys want and I am happy to work out also the forkchoice changes to adapt to the signalling approach that we decided. Just want to coordinate with you what to do before I open PRs on the repo.",
