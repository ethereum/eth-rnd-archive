        "content": "The payload propagation and execution largely share the same time window, except for the payload having a little bit of extra execution time after the ptc deadline. Due to this, it has been previously suggested that we should have a variable ptc deadline for payload availability, for example based on the payload size: smaller payloads have to arrive earlier, leaving more time for execution, larger payloads can arrive later since there will be less gas available for execution anyway \n\nSome discussions about this have taken place this week and quite a few people are convinced that something along these lines is necessary to actually get the scaling benefits without introducing attack vectors. For example, in the current state a builder could publish a small payload with a lot of execution very late, around the ptc deadline, which would prevent the next proposer from executing it on time and end up in a reorg. \n\nOther options to mitigate this problem have been considered but ultimately we feel that the conceptually correct thing to do is to be able to express that the time we have is split between two different resources that have to be used sequentially, and can be used in different proportions. \n\nHere's a proposed spec change for it: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/compare/master...fradamt:consensus-specs:variable-ptc-deadline. In principle it should just be adding a note to the validator spec, however imo it would be nice to have an explicit computation for the payload attestation to have more clarity on how it should be done, so I introduced that (and a few minor downstream changes)",

        "content": "I think this only becomes relevant on shorter slot times. With dual deadlines for PTC this attack is completely impossible with reasonable deadlines. I propose we do not increase spec complexity right now over this (since it's easy to add at any time as it's not a hard fork) and just wait until testing determines what is the propagation max and the attestation deadline we can get. I suspect that we can set the payload availability at 4 seconds and it is impossible to produce a block that takes more than 8 seconds to execute even if we were to 10 fold the gas limit.",
