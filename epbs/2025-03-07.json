        "content": "No for blob propagation this is a game changer the proposer has about 9 seconds to propagate them instead of 2 today. This is why I maintain that peer DAS achieves it's true potential only with 7732. The timing that \u003c@827653956955406406\u003e is referring to is to build a block. Today the time is about 8 seconds assuming the FCU call comes at 4 seconds and you built it by 0. In ePBS FCU could come as late as 9 seconds giving the proposer only 3 seconds to build the block. In the normal case it should be 8 seconds anyway. However, even the worst case scenario of 3 seconds is more than enough: local building takes milliseconds today on a RPI",
