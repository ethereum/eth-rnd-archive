Checkpoints also have a similar ill-defined behavior on Gloas. We could define properly the latest post state as being full if the payload was present. That is we can always set a total ordering on post states in the canonical chain. I had convinced myself that it didn't matter much since the post state is not really used and only the block root was enough, didn't want to add the extra notation and clutter that this would add, but I'm not against if someone wants to specify and document this",
