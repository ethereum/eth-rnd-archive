Over the weekend, I will try to implement these changes in a client to confirm that the specs are correct. At ACDT on Monday, if it's confirmed that we want to move the commitments to the bid, we will immediately start the release process for `v1.7.0-alpha.2` and it should be ready ~18 hours later.",
