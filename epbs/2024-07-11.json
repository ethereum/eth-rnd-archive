        "content": "Damned I think I found a bug in the process block logic due to the way the state root is set in the `latest_block_header`. This relies on the next call to `process_slot` to overwrite this field. But the processing in ePBS requires this state root to be there earlier cause we hash this header to verify the beacon block root when verifying the payload. It always felt like a hack to leave the state root there to be overwritten later, but now it does come back to bite me... I could only find this by trying to get the forkchoice tests to pass",

Alternatively, we could consider removing the block root from the envelope and replacing it with the slot and proposer index",
