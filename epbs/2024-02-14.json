        "content": "\u003e The proposal allows for builders to directly become trustless relays without doing any investment nor buying the credit to get this \"trust\"\n\nI think we're under-selling this point. ePBS is not just an enhancement over the current \"validator-relayer\" path but also a more significant improvement to the existing \"relayer-builder\" path, especially for second-tier builders entering the market. If you're such a builder, consider how much trust you place in a relayer, given the potential for vertical integration between relayers and builders. Validators often choose relayers based on their usage percentage without understanding what the relayer offers (e.g., censorship, permissions, and more). For a small yet competitive builder to enter the market, ePBS offers a far fairer and healthier equilibrium than the current system. We want healthy builder competitions, so there's a significant difference here.",

It's important that everyone is aligned on this. Second concern is the potential emergence of second-order effects similar to MEV-Geth",
