The public key is the user part of the URL (which is part of the spec https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt (`\u003cscheme\u003e://\u003cuser\u003e@\u003cdomain_name\u003e:\u003cport\u003e/\u003cpath\u003e`) and you can enter it like that in your browsers too). It's not pretty but gives additional security guarantees -- namely that proposers can verify that bids come from the actual trusted relay. Without the key, anyone taking over the URL could send bids, and configuring relays with pubkey ensures that a relay needs BOTH the DNS entry and the trusted secret key.",
