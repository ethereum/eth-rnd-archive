I decided to change the input to `root` everywhere, in other specs as well, to just have one consistent way of using the function throughout.\n\nA note about `get_attestation_weight`: it was introduced to avoid an infinite loop in `is_head_weak`, since `should_apply_proposer_boost` in `get_weight` calls `is_head_weak` again. I think it makes sense to also use it in`is_parent_strong` to avoid proposer boot influencing the result.",
