And no worries, we are not rushing this, but are working together here on finding the right release schedule to make this as painless as possible for everyone.\n\nWhat exactly do you mean with \"two releases minimum\"?\n\nI think it make sense for mev-boost to wait with changes to the types for a while. However, we need to make a new mev-boost release sometime well before the hardfork date to give users a chance to upgrade. This version will need to try to decode the payloads into the Capella/4844 types, and fall back to the Bellatrix types if that fails.",
