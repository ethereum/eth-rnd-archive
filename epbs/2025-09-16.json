        "content": "Ohh lol we're so stupid for not having thought of this before!, there's no way to keep the ExecutionPayloadHeader with the current meaning if we commit to the `state_root` in the payload. The reason being that the hash is there.\n\nEven though the state_root commitment may be removed, the fact that these issues  appear shows that keeping execution information in the beacon state is just problematic. \n\nWe could keep the situation as \u003c@363800010518822915\u003e coded it with an empty header, but at this point I believe the best thing is what I had done before which is just replace the header with the bid. It's fine if people want to use the name `ExecutionPayloadBid` but I think we should remove entirely the header and keep the payload bid. We could put it in the same place as the header for those clients that can't handle structure removals.",
