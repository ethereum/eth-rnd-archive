There is a link for the PR in the doc, but the PR is not fully complete and I would not want it to start being polluted with comments yet before I finsih it. So here is a list of documents and their status. The main design doc is  https://hackmd.io/@potuz/rJ9GCnT1C which is mostly complete, it is self contained and hopefully has all the things that \u003c@122421399213047814\u003e requested. I will appreciate if there are some early feedbacks/requests from that document. \n\n The full PR  has the `beacon-chain.md`, ` validator.md`, ` builder.md` I hope complete. The `p2p-interface.md`  is complete on gossip but it is missing some RPC methods. The `engine.md`  has many of the new engine API methods but not all. `fork-choice.md`  has the handlers for blocks, inclusion lists, and payload atteastations. But the core of `(block, slot)`  voting and LMD weight handling is not  there yet. This will take me a little more.  CCing people that may want to work with me on a PoC for the interop \u003c@792822129019584562\u003e \u003c@360491619402776577\u003e \u003c@504202741933932544\u003e \u003c@654267572107083777\u003e \u003c@491624610215886849\u003e",
