    "content": "Ok <@520034910149410861> I think I know what change would make you happy. I think if I change the `if is_payload_timely` check to both timely and available by the PTC then it would work. In this way the PTC will still not force the proposer to reorg and if the data came late it will allow the proposer to reorg",

    "content": "Like in [this commit](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4884/changes/d055ccef9ac9c8ea9fbd2e879e03a309909a1dcb).  This moves the responsibility to the proposer to reorg instead of the PTC so is more lax. However, with this change I think honest proposer behavior should be to choose to build on empty if the PTC has voted against data being available but timely and the proposer has it's share of the data but it's not a super node. \n\nI don't think the situation with the payload is symmetric. I believe the proposer should build on full if the ptc has voted that the payload wasn't timely but was available and the proposer saw the payload timely. But anyway this is for a different discussion, I believe this change is more in line with what you wanted",
