We do keep an eye on the difference between the bid value and payment to the proposer fee recipient, and would make noise if we found any significant discrepancies (at current a number of relays under-bid / over-pay, probably due to the more complex situations such as the proposer fee recipient having transactions in the payload, but  we care more about the over-bid / under-pay scenario).",
