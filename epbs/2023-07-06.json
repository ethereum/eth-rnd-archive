        "content": "I wasn't referring to payment proofs. afaiu, it would take some time to implement correctly. \nMy worry currently is that a builder that underpays might not get caught unless we are carefully looking at logs for every proposal\nI was thinking more of a stop gap solution where we check the fee_recipient balance after the block has already been proposed and compare it to the bid value received during the builder flow. If it's not the same, we send an alert to some monitoring service. The proposer would get scammed for that block, but the community could blacklist that particular builder/relay. Seems like a decent deterrent for builders to avoid underpaying",
