From what I remember, this should be implemented in the consensus clients. It's very unlikely that a non mev-boost block will be more profitable, because the builders do take the public mempool into account when building their blocks. Also, we will have transparency data from the relay that will easily show if builders are being lazy or misbehaving in weird ways. So, nice to have, but not critical for the merge. Others can correct me. \u003c@755590043632140352\u003e was this you? Do we have an issue for this on prysm that we can copy to the others? Did I miss something on my summary?",

And, of course, that also means that anyone that wants to publish their own transaction can do so (albeit infrequently) with a 32 ETH deposit.\n\nAs far as I can see, CR lists would still be corruptable by someone posting to either include different transactions or no transactions. These two situations seen to be broadly equivalent, except that with a second transaction list the validator has a higher incentive to include otherwise-censored transactions.",
