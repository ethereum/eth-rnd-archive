I mean suppose that the proposer\n1_ knows the previous blinded block was heavily attested\n2_ saw the execution payload and it's VALID.\nIf we work under the assumption that the majority of validators are honest (which we do) then the risk is that the builder sent him the block and not the rest of the network. But why is this such a bad thing? What is there for the builder to forfeit his block this way and do network manipulation just to grief the next proposer? With that assumption attesters could just attest for the previous payload and the current beacon block",
