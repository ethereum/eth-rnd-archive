Proposing rights could be thought of as \"who ultimately receives the value from the payload\", whereas building rights are more about \"who can decide what the payload should contain\". Hopefully this distinction allows for more conceptual clarity of how everything fits together, there is surely more to say about it but I wanted to publish early",
