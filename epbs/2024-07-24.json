This attack is succesful cause the attack block is revealed and has a higher justification than the honest branch that is pruned and not pulled up.  Problem is that this attack doesn't really work as intented in ePBS!, the attacking block has no attestations while it's parent does have some from the committee of the attacking block, thus the attacker reorgs itself because of block-slot voting.  It's a neat phenomenom that actually happens in a few other scenarios, but at the same time shows that there may be hidden subtleties with pulled tips in combination with (block, slot)-voting that we need to analyze carefully. cc \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e",
