These are just my personal thoughts as someone in the pro-PTC camp:\n\n* PTC isn’t the complexity people make it out to be. I implemented it PTC duty in Prysm and reviewed the spec, it’s nowhere near as complex as some have claimed. It’s much simpler than the IL committee in FOCIL, which I also implemented\n* PTC enables gossip benefits for delayed execution. Without it, I’m not sure how that would be achieved, especially post-Fusaka, where validators aren’t subscribed to all columns\n* PTC is useful because it opens the door for a second committee, which can potentially be reused for FOCIL or other future extensions",
