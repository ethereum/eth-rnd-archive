        "content": "hey quick question i'm looking to see what validators are registered with a specific relay \n\nlooking at the Relay API spec docs (https://flashbots.notion.site/Relay-API-Spec-5fb0819366954962bc02e81cb33840f5) i can see there is a GET /relay/v1/builder/validators \n\nthis returns a list of validator registrations for the current and next epoch. \n\ni tried this endpoint on https://builder-relay-ropsten.flashbots.net/relay/v1/builder/validators and got a 403. Is it permissioned currently / is this the correct endpoint?\n\nif it's the correct endpoint is there a way to get access or if it's the wrong endpoint is there an endpoint on the relay that provides this information?\n\nThanks for any help",
