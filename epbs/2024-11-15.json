We have here an option to leave this as an implementation detail (clients need to cache them) or enshrine this in protocol by caching the withdrawals in the state (instead of the root as we do now). \n2) The current mechanism allowing any validator to be a builder will break staking pools. We need to find a solution, the simplest is add a new withdrawal prefix, but I'd love to have other ways to attack this issue (I don't know how to though).",
