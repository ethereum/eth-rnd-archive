So when we transition to gloas(let's say at epoch E), proposers should send the preferences for epoch E+1 at the start of that epoch ideally.\nThis P2P gossip rule: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/d1227e8f849018ab47149fdd23a418b2666d0851/specs/gloas/p2p-interface.md#L333 ignores bids on the `execution_payload_bids` topic if a valid `SignedProposerPreferences` has not be seen for the slot. \nThe ValidatorRegistrations(we may remove it and only send the max_trusted_bid preference) for the builder-API too will be sent at epoch E for epoch E+1. \nThis would mean that even if builders are registered at the fork, the first epoch of gloas will be just locally built blocks and builder blocks will actually start appearing at epoch E+1 then?",
