After Gloas, when we receive a block that builds on top of a payload we haven' t seen we request it. What I **haven' t seen specified** is that when we receive an attestation for a past block with index 1 and we do not have the payload, **we should request the payload by root** obtained from the bid from the block. This may actually be more costly than usual.",
