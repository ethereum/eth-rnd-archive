        "content": "Hey guys, while investigating a noticeable decrease in attestation rate \u0026 effectiveness,\nI noticed that in ~5% of epochs, the proposal at the first slot doesn't include any attestations.\n\nFor example — https://beaconcha.in/slot/4752000 includes 0 attestations\nI assume that's why every attestation duty at the prior slot (4751999) seems to have been missed.\n\nOther 0-attestation proposals in the last week since The Merge:\n```\n4704416, 4705248, 4705856, 4706144, 4706976, 4707296, 4707584, 4708448, 4709568, 4709600, 4709888, 4711264, 4711328, 4711616, 4713024, 4714176, 4715296, 4716992, 4717248, 4717536, 4718368, 4718656, 4718688, 4718944, 4718976, 4720256, 4720704, 4720992, 4721280, 4722432, 4722720, 4723008, 4724448, 4724736, 4725536, 4727328, 4727616, 4728448, 4728736, 4729312, 4730816, 4731040, 4731552, 4732192, 4732416, 4733632, 4734208, 4736160, 4736960, 4737248, 4737536, 4738112, 4738688, 4738976, 4740896, 4742304, 4742560, 4742848, 4744000, 4747136, 4748320, 4748896, 4750016, 4750304, 4750592, 4750880, 4752000, 4752576\n```\nGraffitis of 0-attestations proposals in the last 4500 epochs (20 days):\n```\n64 blocks — Lighthouse/v3.1.0-aa022f4\n44 blocks — \n7 blocks — BridgetowerCapital\n7 blocks — Stake Earn Relax 🐠 stakefish\n6 blocks — bloxstaking.com\n5 blocks — Lighthouse/v2.5.1-df51a73\n5 blocks — 🍀🍀溟深辰远🍀🍀\n4 blocks — 🐠Welcome to the New Beginning\n3 blocks — 🌼🌼溟深辰远🌼🌼\n3 blocks — Legend\n3 blocks — Block by Stakely Lido05\n2 blocks — Simply Staking\n2 blocks — ChainLayer\n1 blocks — blockscape\n1 blocks — PMD\n1 blocks — RP-GL v1.6.3\n1 blocks — 👸🏼 said \"Stake!\", not 🥩\n1 blocks — RP-GL v1.6.3 (J.Lohr PE)\n1 blocks — Nethermind for Lido\n1 blocks — :)\n1 blocks — RP-XL v1.6.2 (dgn)\n1 blocks — Lighthouse/v3.1.0\n1 blocks — Shoutout to Luddy! \u003c3\n1 blocks — bluegiraffe\n```\nFrom what I can tell, this issue started happening on Aug 4th.\nIs this expected due to network conditions? Or is it more likely a bug?",

        "content": "thank you, we'll look into this some more on the Lighthouse side\n\nAug 4 corresponds with our v2.5.1 release, but we didn't make any changes to block packing in that release, so I'm not sure why it would be correlated. We _did_ make changes to block packing in v3.1.0, although AFAIK they won't result in blocks with 0 attestation blocks except on hardware that's very strained.\n\nIf you have access to metrics/logs from the 6 bloxstaking validators that proposed 0-attestation blocks, do you mind checking two things for me?\n\n- Are there any ERRO logs around the time of the proposal? Particularly ones about a full attestation queue or attestation timeouts\n- Do you see a plateau in the `beacon_op_pool_attestations_total` metric before the time of the proposal?",
