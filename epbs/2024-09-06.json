I think all such events should be accumulated by CL (in the state) and then send to EL once the payload becomes available, this is I believe will happen with withdrawals as they won't be processed unless there is a payload\n2. I think that those services that relays such events to the application layer should take a strategy similar to the above. Hopefully, they can be updated to do it that way. Maybe I am missing anything here?\n3. Those things should be processed asynchronously in the beacon block next to the available payload, whatever happens after that doesn't matter because that child beacon block would signify the prefix of the chain where those requests have been processed -- so, shouldn't be any problem with that",
