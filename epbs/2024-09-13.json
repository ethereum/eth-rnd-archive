        "content": "Quick recap before someone (usually \u003c@363800010518822915\u003e ) posts a good analysis. \n- \u003c@981249983196041218\u003e presented an analysis pretty much showing that on slot auctions there's a \"trusted advantage\" that does not seem to be possible to avoid. This seems like a serious problem on slot auctions and it'd be nice to weigh against the known problems of block auctions. We decided to keep building on block auctions for the time being cause it's an easy switch to slot auctions if they are decided later. \n- \u003c@554799849288105986\u003e proposed a new method in the Engine API to requests payloads by range. We agreed that it was sensible to have this method. I raised that we shouldn't even need to have the payload to sync. Would like to talk to \u003c@425572898787426305\u003e about this, Perhaps we can schedule an informal call Misha? I think once the requests are sent outside of the payload and the block is hashed as SSZ, we should not need to get the payloads ever on the CL, and would only need to have the payload HTR. \n-  \u003c@363800010518822915\u003e proposed that we moved the processing of withdrawals to the execution phase. Mark seemed to strongly prefer it, I don't oppose it and even like it, but acknowledge that it's different on the beacon chain and would want someone else besides me vouching for it. We decided to requests here for signals from teams if they rather want to move this to the EL payload processing. \n\nHeads-up it was not said in the fork, but ePBS in the CL spec was already changed by Lucas's PR https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3875. I am in the process of rebasing https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3854 which will be very very painful. If you guys want to move withdrawals to the EL processing please signal this right now cause I won't make these changes twice 🙂",

Does this look right to you?\n- Proposer `n` commits to `consensus_block` at 0\n- Relayer waits until `consensus_block` has `40%` weight (`x + 0.4 \u003e 1-x + 0.2 =\u003e x=0.4`) then reveal `execution_block`\n- Proposer `n` sees `execution_block` and release `execution_block'` at the shortly after hoping to win\n- Payload attestation just votes for timeliness of the block, it doesn't care which block it is\n- Proposer is not required to release `consensus_block'` which is to recommit again\n- Proposer `n+1` chooses to build upon `execution_block'` with `consensus_block_1`, if `consensus_block_1` remains canonical then same slot unbundling is successful",
