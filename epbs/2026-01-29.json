Builders will need a beacon endpoint that constructs the payload envelope. That endpoint needs to take the payload as input data. The validator client can't construct this alone from the Payload, it needs to make a state transition.",

I guess similar question if we are asking for state of head/finalized/justified block",

We'll test extensively and when we get good parameters we'll try to squeeze the minimum payload availability to the maximum so  that we have a maximum time for execution/proving. \n- The last deadline will be trickier to decide, reallistic blob limits will play a role and we'll want to have that deadline at least to allow that blob count. In addition reallistic gas limit will play a role since we would want to allow broadcast of pure data blocks up to that deadline. Satisfying these two parameters I believe we will try to set this deadline as early as possible to minimize the free option problem. However, given that blobs are free in this setting, I suspect that we will increase blob throughput up to the duration of the slot. I'm speculating here. \n- On the issue of penalties. I believe adding penalties in this fork will be very unlikely. They do increase complexity considerably and we are already not sure if we'll make a devnet in February. They could still be adedd/explored for next devnets, but my intuition is that we'll ship the fork with the known danger for this problem and if it happens we'll deploy penalties and other mitigations in the next fork.",
