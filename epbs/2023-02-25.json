We’re building a (—fee recipient) smoothing pool for solo stakers and worried about the same type of exploit where a user could steal from the pool a large MEV payout by writing custom script to change their fee recipient based on the size of the bid received. Is this a valid concern? I’ve been actively monitoring RocketPool’s smoothing pool and have not seen any occurrences of this type and there have been plenty of large deposits to that pool.",
