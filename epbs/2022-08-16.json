        "content": "One possible solution that I wanted to share with this group in the FB MEV-boost censor/blacklist/regulatory compliance debate is to have a set of \"preference\" criteria that a node operator can set and signal with.  A block producer can build a block to that specification if they bid for that block. The relay could remain neutral. For example, If I'm in a country and want to comply with government regulations that prohibit me from interacting with a blocked address I could select that attribute preference (e.g. OFAC compliant) in a public profile. The builder; knowing that one of my validators is due to produce the next block could assemble a block that meets the node operators preference criteria and certify to its construction when they submit the hash to the relay. The relay remains neutral. \n\nThis public preference criteria could also be expanded to include other non-regulatory preferences such as \"no sandwich attacks\".  Ethereum would benefit by knowing exactly how much censoring of the blockchain there is by measuring the public preferences set.",
