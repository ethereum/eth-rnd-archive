        "content": "\u003c@688748669268132001\u003e a quick read of the description and it seems to me that this can be made compatible with ePBS. You have some pending withdrawals that you fullfil at a later state when you clear the pending ones.  If I understand this correctly, you whenever you see deposits with different withdrawal credentials for an existing validator you queue the deposit immediately for withdrawal. And then you process withdrawals by getting this pending queue first from the beacon state. The execution payload must still include the same expected withdrawals that you would get from the beacon state alone. As long as this invariant is not broken (and this EIP doesn't break it) it would work with ePBS: the only difference is that in ePBS the withdrawal is honored first in the beacon chain and later paid by the EL.",
