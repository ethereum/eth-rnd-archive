I'm coding this for Prysm, so I will find out about this sooner or later. Consider the following scenario:\n- `Slot: 100, block_root: 0xA, block_hash: 0xB`\n- `Slot: 101, block_root: 0xC, block_hash: 0xD`\n\nI'm a proposer for slot 102 and propose at `t`. Will EL complain if I call `{parent_block_root: 0xC, head_block_hash: 0xD}` at `t-6` and then call `{parent_block_root: 0xC, head_block_hash: 0xB}` again at `t`? Do we need to update the execution API spec here for ePBS?",

It seems the relays are bundling bids data and making it public off-chain. He definitely encouraged us to reach out for any type of \"exotic\" data  regarding the protocol",
