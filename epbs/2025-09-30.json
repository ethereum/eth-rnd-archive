Couple points from my first look:\n- In case of payload being absent, we need a way to indicate that in LightClientHeader\n- Because blob_kzg_commitments and execution_requests are removed from beacon block body, we need probably need to add root of ExecutionPayloadEnvelope \n- ExecutionBranch currently compute proof that links beacon block body to execution payload which is no longer correct. Need to modify it to proof execution payload is linked to the beacon block",

However this comes with a bunch of caveats:\n1. You add interactions both ways EL \u003c-\u003e CL to get the DA needed to be charged on the CL. \n2. You still need to deal with DA from blobs since these need to be attested on every slot and you can't build on top of an unavailable block. \n\nI think the easiest ways of pipelining delayed executions in which we take more than one slot to execute a block are to relax the reorg resistance of proposers.",
