        "content": "currently threshold is set at 50%, of course these numbers were set essentially randomly and I'm happy to change them based on data, there's a tradeoff in that if the threshold is large then the builder loses security and if it's low then the builder can collude to reorg. The PTC only serves to give the builder a boost, either a withheld or a timely boost. It should not affect at all the behaviour of an honest validator. That is, if an honest validator sees a payload and the PTC hasn't reached quorum, the honest validator will not apply the payload boost, but it will still take the payload as head.",
