Clients today send attestations to forkchoice after the slot has finished. When you import a block you immediately can compute head and attest. This doesn't change for the CL block. The problem is that when you import the Payload you're in trouble cause you either delay head computation or you import the attestations for the current block to count them (you need these in your design). Delaying is bad for performance, we all rely on this cashed computation and importing attestations leads to a bunch of bad edge cases",
