Should compute the signing root using compute_signing_root and use the domain specified for beacon block proposals (we could link consensus spec here).\nBuilder API messages: `ValidatorRegistrationV1`, `BuilderBid`. Should compute the signing root using compute_signing_root with domain given by compute_domain(DOMAIN_APPLICATION_BUILDER). As compute_signing_root takes SSZObject as input, client software should convert in-protocol messages to their SSZ representation to compute the signing root and Builder API messages to the SSZ representations defined above.\n```",
