When the client receives a response from the `getHeader` request, how will it know if the response is Bellatrix/Capella? The way this is done for execution payload in CL \u003c--\u003e EL interaction is that the EL will always include a `withdrawals` attribute, even if just an empty list. And for Bellatrix the field is non-existent or `null`",
