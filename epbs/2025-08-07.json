I am increasingly convinced that ePBS is the best path for slot restructuring, and that losing it to risks around the in-protocol auction/payment part (e.g., free option problem) would be a net loss for Ethereum. So I’ve drafted a variant that drops the in-protocol auction while keeping the execution/aggregation pipelining and CL-EL split benefits. The tradeoff is we lose much of the blob-bandwidth boost via dual-deadline PTCs (but likely necessary if we want to truly address the free option issue, as both free option and blob scaling stems from the same commit-reveal timing structure). I believe offering multiple variants only increases the likelihood of ePBS landing, and since the heavy lifting is already done, alternatives like this are mostly subtractive changes to the specs.\n\nDraft write-up: https://hackmd.io/@linoscope/pipelining-only-epbs\nDraft consensus-specs PR: https://github.com/linoscope/consensus-specs/pull/2\n\nLet me know what you all think, all feedback welcome! 🙏",

It checks that the `withdrawable_epoch` is higher than the current epoch. Can't you just compute what the right withdrawable epoch should be and then check against that number? If the payment is very large this epoch should be much larger than the current epoch.",
