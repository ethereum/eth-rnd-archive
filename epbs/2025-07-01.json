There is some value in adding the full committments in that it allows the mempool to start requesting them. However, if we go with a very tight PTC first deadline, the full commitments should be up quickly and it allows to reduce the load on the P2P broadcast of bids. Is there any opposition in keeping the root in the bid instead of the full commitments? I feel eventually we will have a lot of them so it's a bad idea to be transferring them on bids",
