The idea was that lightclients could prove against the block or something but that header has always been useless for the most. The hash is essentially all that matters. I mean if there is pressure to keep the header around we can add these fields to the bid, but It makes it ugly and bulky for no useful reason, the beacon chain has no use for any of these fields and we should have kept a better strict separation of consensus from execution as ePBS is a good step in that direction, I would like to get rid of any execution mentions on the CL, keep the blockhash and let clients prove against that.",
