        "content": "I wrote a small tool to track MEV bid development, it's call mev-bid-stats. It can display the development of the best bid across the time axis. (It's on github). Using it, I came across something odd poking around in some slots. Here is the bid development for a slot in the morning: https://gist.github.com/catwith1hat/3f452a0318ba563be37faadede46f6ab\n\nYou can see that the bid jumps to 2.8 ETH around 3.5s after the slot start. First, a 3.5 second delay is really late, but second I am surprised by such a massive reward jump. \n\nI wonder if there are some searchers see the block but then anticipate block orphanage. This would expose all private transactions (now public) to sandwiching attacks. Maybe that's why the bid is so high?\n\nPeople have discussed the \"don't publish option\" in the context of eBPS. I wonder if historic MEV data would give us an idea on how to price this option better.\n\nI remember that someone anticipated a rather low orphanage rate. 5%? Can't remember. But 2.8 ETH would pay for a lot more orphaned blocks.\n\nI am not sure if that's just a weird one-off or some unexplored data.",
