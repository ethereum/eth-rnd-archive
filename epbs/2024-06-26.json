        "content": "In this scenario, there is an additional step, `Builder -\u003e Relayer`. Indeed, the Nash equilibrium here is the vertical integration of builder-relayer scheme. If we consider that economies of scale make it more efficient for 100 builders to vertically integrate with one relayer, then I agree with this argument. However, I also believe that builders can collaborate or employ professional proxy services as needed to quickly handle get header requests in epbs. This maintains the same advantages as current systems without diminishing trust.",
