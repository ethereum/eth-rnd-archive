For the above mechanism to work the builder will have to deposit some ETH locked up somewhere like a contract correct? and to have that account funded he'll have to either keep depositing there or divert some of the earnings of his block. Therefore I claim that the point of \"how to fund the beacon side?\" is just as hard as that: you keep some balance in a validator account on the beaconside and to fund it you either deposit or explicitly include a deposit transaction with the rewards from the block. The same applies to the other critique: we do not need an extra player on the beaconside: if you want to build you have to validate. This even adds security to the network",
