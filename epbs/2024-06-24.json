It means that they'd have to be listening for local ILs produced at the tail end of slot `n` or during slot `n+1` (after the slot `n` builder has released their payload in any case). I think it's stronger for attesters to do the enforcement so I like that, but it means that it expands their \"active span\" from (between the end of `n+1` PTC to their vote at `n+2`) to (between the end of `n` PTC to their vote at `n+2`). If the active span expansion is not an issue then I think it's a stronger design perhaps",

I do not think there is a clean solution to these problems at all. Here is what I think it's kinda forced for FOCIL + ePBS and I think this may not really work:\n\nThe first point I think forces the IL senders to start at second zero of the slot. This is because the payload is revealed at second 6 and any time before second 12 (zero of the next slot) diminishes the 6 seconds that we give today proposers. This would be the committee in the FOCIL design, they would send the ILs they want to force for slot N during second zero of slot N. \n\nThe second point, is not so problematic if the builder reveals the IL aggregate, since the attesters are the ones enforcing validity and they will do so 9 seconds after the payload reveal. \n\nThe bigest problem is for builders: they are seeing an IL that they need to satisfy at N, during the start of slot N. This is impossible. Therefore I think the only way I can imagine to solve this conundrum is to lose the property that FOCIL brings and fallback to the same problem that 7547 has. I propose the following variation of FOCIL, this is the timeline for the IL.",
