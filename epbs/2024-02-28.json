So I'll ask the question here to see if anyone can argue against (or for) this. The implementation is a very simple change to ePBS, instead of committing to an execution payload header,  we commit simply to a specific builder, not any particular payload. So the builder can reveal whatever he wants in advance. This can be tweaked and enhanced in ways (with some spec complexity for a future iteration) in which the proposer can do this  way in advance of his proposing slot.",
