I was thinking adding \"builder_index\" to the head event or a new \"execution_payload_bid\" event. Any thoughts?",

With the current payment logic in 7732, it would be possible to create 0 amount withdrawals.\nThis wouldn't break anything, also the EL would just handle them as a no-op but it would still mean the EL would load the withdrawal recipient account into cache and create an entry in the withdrawal trie, which might not be needed.\nThis would be a minimal fix:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4651",
