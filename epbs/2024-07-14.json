A builder has a trade that looks great when its bid is included in the block, but by the reveal deadline, the trade is significantly underwater. In this case, the builder simply chooses not to reveal the block because it's cheaper to pay the proposer than to take the trade loss. The builder arguably censors the entire block here.\n\nWhat's worse is that instead of not revealing the block, the builder could send the withheld message to try to reorg the consensus block so they don't have to pay. The next slot proposer will build on the parent block if `wb + 1 - x \u003e x`, which can be pulled off if less than 30% of the beacon committee has voted for the block. Curious for your thoughts \u003c@486501030046203915\u003e \u003c@755590043632140352\u003e",
