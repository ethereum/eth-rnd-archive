        "content": "So before 7732 - we saved space on the CL by just storing the `ExecutionPayloadHeader` and letting the EL store the transactions. Post 7732, there's nothing in the spec to allow the CL to save space in the same way.. Off the top of my head it would be something like having the CL store:\n```python\nclass ExecutionPayloadEnvelopeHeader(Container):\n    payload_hash: Hash32\n    execution_requests: ExecutionRequests\n    builder_index: ValidatorIndex\n    beacon_block_root: Root\n    slot: Slot\n    blob_kzg_commitments: List[KZGCommitment, MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK]\n    state_root: Root\n```\njust wondering if anyone has thought about this..",
