        "content": "Hey ETH2 researchers, from Gitcoin 👋 \n\nI've been chatting with \u003c@!386690701343326219\u003e about possibly having a few of u on the Gitcoin livesteam.  We did an ETH2 livestream a couple of months ago ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLvTrX8LNPbPkOOTmVqjljLs2vk5-YZwLG\u0026v=td750o3xf8k\u0026feature=emb_title) and the community really seemed to love it.\n\nWe'd love to do a more phase2 centric livestream in the coming days.  Is there interest?  If so, is there a Friday in May that works for u?\n\nOur goals are to build excitement about ETH2 roadmap and combat misinformation.  Plus our community of devs would really love to learn about the ETH2 Phase 2 roadmap.",
