        "content": "Cool. I have mentioned that we will be operating in a time restricted environment after the Merge. And resource exhaustion attacks may shift beacon block propagation time and thus impact on consensus. If we assume the attack scenario leading to 24 seconds block propagation delay (2 slots) due to high execution time then we'd miss `2/3` of blocks worth of slots. Though, this might look severe but recent accident with deposit data voting caused `~3/4` blocks missed in epoch (https://beaconcha.in/epoch/32304) without preventing finality showed that the beacon chain is pretty resilient to this kind of attacks. But anyway attacks leading to 50 seconds execution delays can start breaking finality and should be taken in account in the analysis.\n\nI am curious about potential attack vectors that could be exploited to increase execution time significantly. Obviously, there are precompiles (some edge cases) and mostly state access. But since we have snapshots providing `O(1)` state access time during the execution, I suppose that the worst case for any state access including contract code reads should be computed out of reading and writing to storage slot or contract's code that doesn't exist; this is the worst case for DB engines as it doesn't hit any cached value (probably some bloom filters can handle it, idk). How do you think attack vectors look like with snapshots?",

        "content": "First of all, there is no O(1) access time usually, unless you keep the entire state in a very large hash map - which is impractical, because you cannot easily iterate over it, and it is hard to persist. So I would say it is more like O(log S), where S - size of the state. The coefficient there depends on whether State fits in RAM or not, for example. Currently, it can still fit in RAM on 64 Gb machines",
