That's it? *I asked myself*\nI have both arguments required to deploy a contract at null address. I was thinking, what can be the consequences of so much money to come into existence from thin air? What would I do with that? Would I be asked to burn that money again? With all those questions I chose arbitrum as my first chain for testing(obviously, didn't wanted to lose money in gas fee in the dream of becoming millionaire).\nStep 1: Deployed Deployer contract. Succeeded!\nStep 2: Call `deployWithdrawer(salt,endowment)` with generated arguments. That too Succeeded!\nStep 3: Now what? looked at arbiscan.io searching if there is any contract on null address. *Confused* there wasn't any.\n...\nBut I know how withdrawer contract behave let's ask it for 1 ether \nStep 4: called `withdraw(amount)`. Succeeded! really? \n*Checks balance*\n*Crickets*",
