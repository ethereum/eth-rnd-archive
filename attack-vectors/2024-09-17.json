        "content": "Hi,\nI'm looking into the research paper Speculative Denial-of-Service Attacks In Ethereum (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-yaish.pdf) presented in August.\n\n\u003e We evaluate our attacks on an Ethereum testnet and find that by combining ConditionalExhaust and MemPurge, adversaries can simultaneously burden victims’ computational resources and clog their mempools to the point where victims are unable to include transactions in blocks. Thus, victims create  empty blocks, thereby hurting the system’s liveness.\n\u003e \n\u003e The attack’s expected cost is $376, but becomes cheaper if adversaries are validators.\n\nHas anyone done an analysis of this attack vector? How concerning is this?\n\nThere's a brief Q\u0026A style summary from Blockworks: https://mail.blockworks.com/p/thursday-attacking-mailbag",
