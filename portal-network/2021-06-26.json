Wrote them down here: https://notes.ethereum.org/2DqkbLEZSn6-FdXWy07G2Q  \n\nI'll plan to talk through the things in that document on the next implementer call.  (A: a concept for functionality that could be built on top of the base network functionality that takes advantage of cooperation along lines of mutual interest.  B: an idea for the storage rules for state data that seems theoretically promising as a route to improve data retrieval speeds)",
