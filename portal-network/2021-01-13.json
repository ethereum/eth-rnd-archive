Sync a nethermind node, expose jsonrpc server \u0026 metrics - then restart sync at block xxx with max peers set to 0 (effectively pausing the sync). then call `eth_estimateGas` with a various set of common txs \u0026 collect data from the reported metrics (# of state read/writes, # of storage read writes, # of trie operations, etc.) for the corresponding tx. I've tested this all locally on a small scale (without a fully synced node) - and the plan appears to be working as expected. But if anybody would like to help validate/invalidate this approach before I replicate this on a fully synced node, that would be great",
