Feel free to also join our discord if you want to discuss something specific regarding the Nim implementation: https://discord.gg/Na5Ah9JS\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask early on. I'd also suggest to share a (draft) PR early on so we know the direction you are going.\nAside from that, I'll create an issue in nim-eth Github with a description, so that could also be a place to follow up on the technicalities of the implementation.",

        "content": "As Piper mentioned, it is actually about using uTP to stream data from \"within\" the discv5 protocol. One part here is, obviously, the implementation of the uTP protocol. This can be for the bigger part  stand-alone from discv5 probably. Another part is how to properly integrate this with current discv5 packet and/or message types. There are some different approaches possible here, but I'm not sure if this is supposed to be part of your project?",
