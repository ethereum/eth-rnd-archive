I still may need to do some amount of network traversal to identify the nodes that are close-enough to actually have the data.",

        "content": "Something that needs more eyes on this is the distance function.  I went with an absolute distance function that wraps the keyspace around on either side.  The reason for this is that xor doesn't preserve locality and I believe that we do need a locality preserving distance function in order to preserve the desired property that nodes store contiguous sections of the trie.  I'd like more eyes on this to validate/invalidate that xor doesn't gives us the properties we want and that either the proposed distance function seems appropriate or any suggestions on a different distance function.  Wrapping the keyspace on either end may be un-necessary complexity, since there's no benefit at the merkle proof storage level...  but I think that if we don't wrap it, the data on the far edges of the trie will naturally end up with 1/2 as much replication....",
