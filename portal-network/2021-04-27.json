        "content": "\u003e the issue is that the way discv5 rust handles talkreq messages is a bit limiting. Currently, it uses a pure function callback we can define which takes  (request, protocol)  bytes and returns the response. This doesn't work for our usecase where we need access to the discv5 dht to respond to FindNode requests (so it can't be a pure function). Also I think there hasn't been much thought put into the talkreq api (atleast in rust) because nobody uses it yet",
