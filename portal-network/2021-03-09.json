Doesn't implement any of the congestion control, but it manages the streams of packets with all the ack-ing and lost-packet re-transmission stuff.  Up next is for me to setup the benchmark to do real measurement of the data transfer rates.  In our call tomorrow I'd like to discuss uTP vs libp2p and try to narrow in on selection criteria.",

From what I'm seeing there doesn't appear to be any clean way to use that for our needs.  It is fundamentally \"topic\" based and  don't see any obvious way to map what we're trying to do onto a topic system.  There could be an alternate design, but it feels like there's enough information at this stage to choose uTP as the simple starting point and we can migrate to libp2p later if uTP proves insufficient.",
