I don't immediately see a better solution than hacking it by removing one of the options (like do we really need a distance of 1-bit away? so we could just skip it and start at 2-\u003e256, and shift it to 1-\u003e255). A hacky solution probably isn't worth saving a byte on each distance parameter, it's just bugging me.",
