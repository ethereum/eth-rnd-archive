To verify these proofs one will need to download beacon state, the other way would be linking proofs to the most recent state root, then the light client sync may be sufficient to verify them. Though, it would require proofs to be constantly updated by some party. Historical roots list is appended each `8192` slots and the most recent blocks may be retrieved by light client sync.",
