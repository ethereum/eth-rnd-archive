If we store the trie in the network keyed by (path, hash) rather than keyed by (hash) how much extra space will this consume?\n\nIt's taking me a bit to get acquainted with how TurboGeth stores trie nodes but I've got something which can scan through the state. Turbogeth is great! I wrote something a few years ago which iterated through all the state in a Geth node, it took about 24 hours. With TG it takes ~30 minutes. There are apparently 118,498,304 accounts and ~413,901,703 storage items which consume a total of ~5,8GB (not counting any intermediate nodes).",
