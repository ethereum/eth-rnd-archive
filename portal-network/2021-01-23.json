The first bin records every access which touches an account last touched 1-4 blocks ago, the next bin counts every access which touches an account last touched 5-16 blocks ago. I've only run it over the touches which happened in block 10980418, and I'm not able to attribute any touches which happened more than ~300000 blocks ago, and I was working off of a corrupted tg database so I don't have much confidence in this data. It's coming together though, once I have a fresh tg (which should be later today 🤞 ) I'll be able to re-run the analysis and come up with numbers I'm more sure of. This is interesting though if it's true! Just in a single block we're already found ~16 reads which access state last accesed 270k blocks ago",
