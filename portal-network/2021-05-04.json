Most of this has already been written down in the 3-part light client blog posts here (https://snakecharmers.ethereum.org/the-winding-road-to-functional-light-clients/) or in the glossary here (https://github.com/ethereum/stateless-ethereum-specs/wiki/Glossary)\n\nI'm happy to do this work, but I think if any of you want to test/improve your understanding of what we're doing this would be a good way to do that.  Simply opening a PR to that document and then we can collaborate on it there (with me reviewing it and giving suggestions on any missing pieces or whatever)",
