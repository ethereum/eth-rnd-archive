I think we should start investigating what our gossip network might look like because it seems potentially silly to have A) A \"gossip\" network for new blocks, transactions, and eventually witnesses  B) A state network with it's own gossip and C) A chain history network with it's own gossip.\n\nCombining the state network and chain history network gossip into the single \"One gossip network to rule them all\" should be investigated.",
