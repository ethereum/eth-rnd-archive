On my side, I was working on PRs for extracting a core package for trin and bootstrapping the chain history crate. PR is also pushed for fixing a small bug which prevented trin to ping the bootstrap node. Next, I will work on implementing ACCEPT, OFFER and STORE messages for trin-history and then probably join \u003c@!755612893046636585\u003e on exploring the testing framework.",
