(That is the first packet in the connection handshake) I mean that would probably be the easiest way to give the other Node our ENR to send Talk Requests back.\n\nAnother option solution would be to keep a vector of ENR's for connections or something \u003chttps://github.com/sigp/discv5/pull/78#issuecomment-886052341\u003e Which was a issue brought up here, because we can't guarantee we have a nodes ENR in the routing table. \n\nThe first solution would definitely be easiest with how things are currently setup, but maybe something along option 2 would be better cause apparently store will only use talk requests too, so it will need option 2?\n\nAlso should I ask you on topics like this, or should I just do something/change something and ask for forgiveness later or however the saying goes?",
