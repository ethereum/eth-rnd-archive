        "content": "High level overview.  We settled on a model where the network is storing all of the data in two formats.\n\n1. Trie data that supports `GetNodeData` style trie traversal.\n2. Contiguous proof data that supports the O(1) access pattern to get directly at the leaf data.\n\nThis duplication increases the total amount of data stored in the network which is an intentional trade-off to ensure that we can retain the O(1) access pattern.  The `GetNodeData` style data is what allows for exclusion proofs to be generated (which otherwise cannot be done in most cases with the O(1) proof data).  Similarly, the `GetNodeData` style data is what allows nodes to update their contiguous proof data.",
