        "content": "I'm going to refer to my new proposed distance function as the \"absolute\" distance for simplicity.  I am reasonably confident there is no practical difference in using either xor or absolute distance.  The only difference is that in the extremely rare case that two nodes are exactly the same distance from a piece of content which should be roughly the same likelihood as a hash collision (1/2**256) that there is some trivial/minor ambiguity about which node would be ultimately responsible for storing the content... but in reality both nodes would store it.",

        "content": "This is a good question that I'm curious about as well. I've been envisioning ultimately running a portal network client integrated locally with an iOS/Android wallet app. I don't know about Android, but I'm pretty sure that on iOS you can't be handling network traffic once your app is in the background (you can do some hacky APNS stuff, but that's all centrally coordinated). So our app could only be functioning as a portal network node for the time that the wallet app is actually open, which probably won't be much.",
