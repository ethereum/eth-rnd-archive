I was looking for an interesting project to work on, and \u003c@!364458974906548225\u003e was kind enough to reach out and invite me here. My background is mostly in a different field (NLP/NLU for voice assistants), but I'm here to learn as much as I can. For now, you can think of me as someone who tags along trying to absorb knowledge about the protocol and the current state of stateless while figuring out how to contribute best. Thanks, and happy to be here 🙂",
