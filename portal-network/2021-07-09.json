        "content": "Ok so there's a few more CDAP people interested in working on the portal network components. How about we have a first \"what the heck are we doing\" open zoom next week. Everybody's welcome to join. I think the earlier in the week the better (I'm good for Monday), but here's a doodle poll that includes the whole week: https://doodle.com/poll/9nkmafpbxeaxsfca?utm_source=poll\u0026utm_medium=link\n\nGoal for this zoom is to get a sense for where each of us are at in terms of knowledge/experience/understanding around the portal network/ethereum in general, and get a rough plan for the work/research that needs to be done such that we can divvy it up and work in smaller groups.\n\n\u003c@!403199329520713728\u003e \u003c@!694014391288332358\u003e \u003c@!556982778684637185\u003e \u003c@!472419717970133002\u003e \u003c@!690224518383534174\u003e \nAnd then it seems like \u003c@!240180844130598912\u003e and \u003c@!436721623014572042\u003e already have their projects scoped, but feel free to join.\nOnce it's scheduled I'll post the link so that any latecomers to this channel can join.",
