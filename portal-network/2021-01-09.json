        "content": "If it doesn't work out, the next most promising avenue would be to do the account trie using the method you described above with subtree proofs housed in the DHT that are kept up to date and then to do contract storage via a separate mechanism.  In theory we could do contract storage the naive `node_hash -\u003e node` way, and do accounts the more complicated but efficient way.  My gut says that if the GetNodeData DHT is too slow, but not by a significant margin this could gain us the performance necessary to push it across the line.",
