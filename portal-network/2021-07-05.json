I understand that this scheme look something like that, each full node will need to keep this additional data structure called double batched merkle log accumulator (fancy MMR tree: https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.md) and update it with each new block.  Then when requested, those full nodes,  will be able to generate proof of inclusion from this data structure.\n\nSimilar scheme is described in fly-client paper (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226.pdf)\n\nI wonder does this double batched merkle log accumulator solves all problems described in the paper i.e\n1. Is it enough in the setting where block have different difficulties ? (researches in this paper needed to adapt MMR with addtional data about difficulties)\n2. Do we need some sampling protocol or verification of at least few blocks to be sure that we got header from correct fork ?\n\nIf I am missing something obvious or this problems kinda does not affect portal client from some reason please let me know.",
