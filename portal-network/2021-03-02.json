If this roadmap for ultra-light client infrastructure yields the expected result, 1-million nodes should be a reasonable mark to hit.  Also, it may be reasonable for nodes to offer \u003e100MB which could greatly expand how much storage the network has....  Basically, the numbers aren't that far off from \"we could reasonably support the data requirements with the expected size of the network\"",

I'm not sold that this is the right path forward, but I think it's worth investigating because there's something really nice about being able to do everything over DiscV5.  Especially when we get to chain history where the data we're transferring will regularly exceed the UDP packet size.  It seems like we should be able to implement an equivalent gossip network using this approach without needing libp2p at all.",
