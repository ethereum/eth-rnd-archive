        "content": "Question on the discv5/overlay routing tables that I could not conclusively figure out. If a node is in the overlay routing table, will it necessarily be in the underlying discv5 routing table?\n\nFor context, we will need to build and manage a separate routing table for each overlay network a portal node participates in. I'm not sure if there needs to be some sync mechanism so that particular events (e.g. evictions) that occur on the discv5 routing table \"bubble up\" automatically to the routing table(s) of the overlay network(s)? Otherwise, we may have to \"rediscover\" those events at the overlay level. However, if a node, or even most nodes, that are in the overlay table are unlikely to be in the discv5 table, then such a mechanism adds complexity without much benefit",
