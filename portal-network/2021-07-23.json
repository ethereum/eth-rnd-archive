Thumbs up this message if that works for you (thumbs down if not and we'll accommodate that). I'd think we're mostly going to talk about the Chain History work and sync about implementation of that PoC. Everybody's welcome though.",

One interesting effect is that a node becomes perpetually responsible for any given account, so as the state root changes, you'll still ask the same node for updates to that account. Although the address hashes are randomly distributed (kind of, more on that in a sec), the *interest* in addresses is probably not. Most users will hit the ENS registry at some point, for example. This is similar to the problem of everyone being interested in the peer that's storing the state root, but at least that interest is for a limited time period. Once a node launches, it would perpetually be responsible for the same accounts (roughly). So there could be some incentive to re-roll the private key if you start hosting a \"too-hot\" spot of the state.",

(ie~ how much gas do you have to spend to create a bunch of addresses with the same first byte. Assuming the clients tend to split the state space into 1/256 chunks (which seems a reasonable approximation: it would mean storing less than 1G), how much gas would it take to store `1/25.6 * (total number of addresses)` in the state. This ignores storage, but the principle is the same, for when we go a bit deeper on the analysis.",
