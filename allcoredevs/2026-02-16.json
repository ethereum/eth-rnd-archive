I presume that you know how to write code here's a pro tip validation proof and falsifiability has nothing to do with translating a set of instructions to a programming language in order for that code to run properly whatever it is you want to execute must already be a validated concept in the first place believe it or not there are some of us who have the intellectual capability to validate verify or falsify without having to do it all over again for the second time just to translate it in another language so you stick to your Skillset and I'll stick to mine you don't have to be rude and ignorant while you provide statements with little to no value",
