I agree with \u003c@1126229231572094976\u003e's comment https://forkcast.org/calls/acdt/067?chat=01:03:59\n\u003e Clients provided great rankings and cfi'd eips should j just be included in the order based on how much support they gained.\n\n^ This feels fair to me and should eliminate any bias towards including smaller/larger EIPs. The testing impact can then inform when to stop adding.\n\nAlso like \u003c@415548822983278593\u003e's comment to propose devnet scope a week in advance as for those of us not able to join the call, it gives some time to consider and object.\n\nAlso agree we should have at least a prototype implementation before SFIing but I don't think it necessarily needs to be included in devnet or have an impl from most clients. One prototype is usually enough to tease out most spec issues.",
