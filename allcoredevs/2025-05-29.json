The flags exist, expiry is not yet default.\n\n- Nethermind: In a release, works well on mainnet.\n- Geth: I've seen failures on Sepolia with `1.15.11`, resolved in `master`\n- Besu: In `25.6.0-RC1`, works well on mainnet.\n- Erigon: There’s a PR, I was able to sync mainnet with history expiry.\n- Reth: An issue is open for pre-merge expiry. They’ll need the blocks to execute them (full sync) and might use era1 for that, before dropping the blocks.\n- Nimbus EL: pre-alpha, but in my testing works on mainnet. Requires era1 import from which only headers are taken. Full sync only.",

Happily a large portion of those run Geth or Nethermind and so can expire pre-merge history now.",
