We agreed that we should aim to have full JSON RPC support for 4844 as part of devnet-7\n- We finalized the Cancun scope 🏝️ ! EIPs 4788 (Beacon Block Root in EVM) and 5656 (MCOPY) were included. We agreed to bound the number of block roots in 4788, and to potentially remove 5656 from the upgrade if testing or implementations are a significant bottleneck. \n- We agreed to merge this Engine API PR: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/418\n- We briefly discussed the requirements for CL nodes wrt to sending attestations before having validated all current blobs, and the impact on the UX of changing CL clients. We'll continue that conversation in ACDC next week!\n- Lastly, there will be a call focused on the Holesky launch next week: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/803 - it would be great if each client team could send a representative. The call is open to anyone who is interested in testnets 🙂",
