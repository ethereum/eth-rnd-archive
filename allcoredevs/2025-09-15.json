Nimbus can and does. But it needs the KZG libraries, version 2.1.2. But these libraries might have some other issue. But, and this is the same (I think) point as concerns Teku, it's that a client can't in general pass the alpha.6 tests fully without a column ID ordering which 2.1.2 (but not 2.1.1) enforce. So reverting back to 2.1.1 means skipping some alpha.6 tests",
