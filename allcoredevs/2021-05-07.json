We will reach out to miners directly to tell them to target a 2x'd gas limit on the fork block. We merged \u003c@!543900561460822016\u003e's PR for this: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/commit/67d0d75f6393f6a109f2dc81cffc1e6541fb7aa3\n\n1. We'll open a PR against 1559 to add the names of the JSON RPC fields to the EIP directly for clarity. No one volunteered to do that, though. \u003c@!206016661470314496\u003e \u003c@!211091239112671234\u003e given we agreed to go with your naming scheme, can either of you do it 😄 ? \n\n2. For the rest of the JSON RPC changes, we'll spec the diff outside of EIP-1559. We can either use the eips repo (e.g. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3041) or the eth1-specs repo where we're starting to move things over. Either option probably works, but we currently don't have anyone to do this. If someone wants to take this on, please ping me. **Funding is available for this.**\n\n3. We'll also make a small PR to 1559 to only set the `BASE FEE` on the fork block vs. having the fork block treat its parent as having the starting base fee. \u003c@!543900561460822016\u003e will open a PR for this. \n\n4. For Baikal, there seemed to be some confusion in the client teams re: the included EIPs. The full list is: \n\n EIP-1559 Commit Hash - 67d0d75f6393f6a109f2dc81cffc1e6541fb7aa3 (updated based on (0) above\n EIP-3198 Commit Hash - 081db1a6614e523dd791691cff7016e32c369912\n EIP-3529 Commit Hash - 6079eba5d1344a6b68075f79c14d4b7caf13ef53\n EIP-3541 Commit Hash - TBA",

Similarly, for 1559-specific testnets like Baikal, blocks will likely stay under their target gas consumption. So on all of these networks I assume the base fee will just fall to its minimum value (7 wei?) and then more or less stay there forever.
