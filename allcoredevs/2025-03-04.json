In order to block the functionality entirely, an attacker will have to keep excess at the same level for long period of time which is very costly.\n\nScenario that is described in the recent report causes spikes in the withdrawal request fee which are indeed cheap for attacker. It's basically a griefing vector, not a DoS, the cost of an hour of DoS would be very high",
