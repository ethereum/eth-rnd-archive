        "content": "\u003ctimbeiko\u003e Thanks for sharing!\nDefinitely need to think about this more, but a few initial thoughts: \n- I think we’ve tried hard to avoid committing to timelines publicly, caveating them when we do, and also having documents which explain what’s still todo (e.g. the readiness checklist). It’s a fine line between sharing progress as it’s done and also making it clear that “unknown unknowns” are very real.if we find a bad bug even 1 week before we go live, we will have to delay. Suggestions welcome about how we can communicate this better!\n- We have started approaching end users and applications/infra to get them to use the devnets, Kintsugi being the latest. Our “strategy” has been to try and grow the number of stakeholders involved in each iteration, but we are getting towards more stable ones where it’d be nice to see more professional use. \n- as for comms/PR, we currently have the Ethereum blog, where we share major updates, my blog where I share more in-progress ones, and various ad-hoc channels. Is there anything else you think we should have? More stuff on the Ethereum.org blog?",
