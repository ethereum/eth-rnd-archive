Go over the Berlin testnet forks and make sure all the issues have been diagnosed, shared, etc. and decide whether they warrant changing anything about the Berlin rollout. \n2. Go over the few EIPs that are related to EIPs already included in London, specifically, 1559 \u0026 the difficulty bomb. \n3. Decide if we want to limit London's scope to things discussed in (2)\n4. Discuss all the other proposed EIPs, and whether they should fall into London/Shanghai/no upgrade \n\nMy hunch is we'll probably run out of time, so hopefully we can get through 1-3. To hopefully help make some async progress, here are the \"open questions\" for the various items in (2):",
