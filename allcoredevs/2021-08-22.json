Not devs that are only trying to imagine the utility function of actual node owners. It's very hard to make a sybil-resistant system for this under PoW, but under PoS node owners = stakers.\nIn addition, right now gas limit is so low it decreases number of active nodes. Empirically, I turned off my ethereum node as I stopped needing it as new apps moved elsewhere. Instead I set up a matic node. I know of one person that also turned off their ethereum node for the same reason.",
