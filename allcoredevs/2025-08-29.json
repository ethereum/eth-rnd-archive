This phase can be very unpredictable because this is where we uncover most of the implementation problems in our client and it does require time to fix. But we can minimize these problems by clearly signalling and rejecting any additional scope creep early so we're confident no major refactors will be coming, which is partially the reason why we didn't get fusaka into our unstable earlier.",
