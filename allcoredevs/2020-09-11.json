So even if the goal wasn't to try and stop ProgPoW the call for an audit was still the correct move.  IMHO if the only goal was to block it there would have been an insistence that the GitCoin grant was the only source to pay for the audit.",

If it's pure \"generic\" evm, we sometimes check with a 'snailtracer',which is basically a very old raytracer converted to bytecode. I'm not sure what the bulk of the ops are, but there's quite a lot of arithmetics and general looping, pushing etc, probably not so much precompile usage, but I'm not sure\n```\n./build/bin/evm --statdump -codefile snailtracer.hex run 1\u003e/dev/null \nEVM gas used:    305382972\nexecution time:  318.692387ms\nallocations:     1661\nallocated bytes: 56905160\n```\nThe bytecode is here: https://gist.github.com/karalabe/dc2fd6add66341c60e7cc96b91ba0f76",
