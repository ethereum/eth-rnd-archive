        "content": "Hey all. I've finalized my execution layer cross validation proposal (i.e. stateless ethereum before Verkle), at least to a state where I feel confident about the design, have numbers to back it up, code is working and mostly on mainline Geth.\n\nProposal: https://gist.github.com/karalabe/47c906f0ab4fdc5b8b791b74f084e5f9\nSummary for CL devs: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1084#issuecomment-2189676688\nLast PR not merged in: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30069\n\nThe extreme TL;DR: Extending the engine API with the methods needed for stateless Ethereum, which in the current MPT world would be immediately useful for detecting consensus faults in validators (i.e. no slashings) and detecting consensus faults in prod services (i.e. no double spends). The design also permits Verkle to be dropped right in and have stateless Ethereum working instantly (ok, CL still needs to propagate the witness among each other, obviously). Also important to note, the design is completely compatible with MEV builders (i.e. you can have truly stateless validators). The design is also minimally invasive on both the EL and CL codebases, which I'm very proud of.\n\nAt this point I'd like to have others poke holes at it, or to pitch in whether they do or do not like it and why. Unless there's opposition, would be nice to see how to move forward. Happy to collab with any CLs wanting to integrate and test it.",
