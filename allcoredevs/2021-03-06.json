I also think it is healthy that there is a specific issue about the agenda, so that any concerns can be raised at a \"general issue\" for the agenda itself. (But I don't want to bike shed here a lot, so to just go along with the current way is OK for me, I'm just raising the point that I think it is healthy that there is a central asynchronous point to comment about the ACD agenda)",
