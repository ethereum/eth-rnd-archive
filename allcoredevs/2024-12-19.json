There are some protocol changes that will only affect the hardware requirements of stakers, but most of them affect both stakers and full nodes, and I think it's pretty misleading to have these documents out without explicitly stating that these apply to full nodes: in which case I think the numbers in that document are actually too high, cause most people will not have a computer dedicated to run a node, an internet connection dedicated to run a node, etc.",
