We'll CFI 7702 for now, include it in the next devnet, and host a breakout room in the next two weeks to finalize the spec. Assuming there is consensus on the final spec by the next ACDE, we'll formally include it in the fork. PR 🔜 ! \n- We had a lot of conversation about when we should aim to ship Pectra, what features may warrant extending the scope, to what extent it would affect dates, etc. It feels like decisions around PeerDAS inclusion on the CL side are the most significant factor in the \"shape\" of the update. **CL teams**, please take the time to think through this before ACDC next week, as it would be great to make a decision on the topic then. Assuming we do, we'll finalize the EL side of things on the next ACDE. The EthPandaOps details many options: https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/pectra-fork-thoughts\n\n**Candidate EIPs**\n- Updates were shared about EOF, with the solidity team and a few EL teams indicating support, while Geth has concerns about the scope/timeline/complexity of the feature. \n- Other EIPs were discussed, without much feedback from client teams: 7623, 7212, and SSZ. See the agenda for the linked updates. \n\n**Other topics**\n- I highlighted the Nyota recap blog post shared earlier\n- A proposal to add `returnData` in Transaction Receipts (https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/542). No consensus beyond capturing the context from the call's conversation in the form of a better rationale in the PR and continuing the conversation there. \n- The minimum miner tip conversation: after much back and forth, we agreed this should not be standardized across all clients, and Geth is going to keep a non-zero minimum, but evaluate lower options than the current 1 Gwei. \n\nLastly, \u003c@364458974906548225\u003e gave a Portal/\u003c#953349957400821860\u003e update: there is an IRL meetup about it next week, please reach out to him if you'd like to join 😄 !",

They stated it is a good feature and want to include it at some point.\n\nEthJs preference is to have two forks. To keep the current Pectra fork in its current form including  EIP-7702. And the second fork with  EOF, being proposed directly for Q1 2025 (likely end of Q1 though) and not e.g. Q2 to not substantially shift the Verkle fork timeline, even if placed before the Verkle fork.\nBlog post: https://notes.ethereum.org/C2xqg0pKRW2TL7WfFqka_Q?view\n\nNethermind listed two options with three or two forks (The last fork in both options being Verkle). They would like to ship EOF before Verkle, option 1) would have EOF in the second fork while option 2) would be a GigaFork with EOF included.\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1052#issuecomment-2152417008\n\nSolidity is strongly in favour of EOF, while Vyper supports it ( with the caveats https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/745077610685661265/1243241532052602881 ). Alex expressed that ACD dont have good visibility on how people would use EOF and how important it is for them.\n\nEthPandaOps gave an overview and potential fork options and stated they prefer option 2 which is two forks for CL and potentially including EOF in Prague.\nPost: https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/pectra-fork-thoughts\n\nTimestamps of youtube video, hope I didn't miss something: \n41:30 - 49:40, 1:20:00 - 1:23:00, 1:26:00 - 1:30:00",

I think most folks agree it's more important to make the *best* decision rather than the *fastest* decision here. But its also a balance. (e.g. losing momentum can have 2nd-order effects). Idea should be sticking to certain defaults that we set helps us to generally make the best decisions as effectively as possible? \n\nFor example: \n\ndefault: \nif we have a set of EIPs that get \"included\" for a specific fork, then the default should be to ship those \"included\" EIPs before we expand scope. \n\nexception: \nIt is the exception that any EIP: (i) gets *removed* after being \"included\" (e.g. due to issues found during testing), or (ii) gets *added* at a much later date (e.g. bc progress is made significantly faster than expected, and realize a growing importance of the EIP, like we are seeing now with peerdas)",
