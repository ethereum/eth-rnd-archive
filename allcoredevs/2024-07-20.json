        "content": "It’s almost two years now since the Merge. Besides the energy savings and slight reduction of inflation which might not last, none of the promised speed and capacity multiples has been implemented. And Supporting L2s does not depend on the Merge. Then way before anyone could have the confidence on L2 sequencer decentralization plan(do not worry about implementation yet), EF core developers prematurely talked about avoid EL development pushing ETH into a settlement only chain. Has the development in the past 4 years truly benefited ETH end users? Maybe, but not before L2 sequencers stop running on a single machine controlled by a single guy. Then it’s wrong to force executions to L2 by providing worse experiences(EVM, TPS and finality), it’s only right to provide the same execution experiences(EVM consistency included) consistent with top L2s before L2s are matured.",
