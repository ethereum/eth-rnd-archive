I could definitely add more metrics to the code, but if I'm going to do some work to make these stats easily accessible I'd prefer to do it in a way that others can use it. Do you think there is a desire to merge additional metrics into geth upstream that expose more mainnet information? Maybe even under a different flag? If not, it may make more sense to write a light service that queries the client's rpc and submits the data to influxdb/prometheus - unfortunately some things like new accounts created aren't readily available from rpc",
