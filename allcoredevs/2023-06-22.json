Presentation here: https://notes.ethereum.org/@danceratopz/execution-spec-tests-overview-202306 \n- Dencun updates: moved the 4844 precompile address to `0xA` to pack them tightly (and will move BLS to another address), proposal to bound the 4788 storage size (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7178), Engine API spec release (https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/420) and Dencun CL spec should be out in the next few days!\n- Devnet updates: we had some issues on devnet-6, and will restart another devnet with the same specs once clients pass hive tests \u0026 have stable releases. \n- ERCs / EIPs repo split: client teams agreed we should split the repos, with some objections some EIP editors. We'll discuss how to move this forward in next week's EIPIP call: https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/issues/245",
