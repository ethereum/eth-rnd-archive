I believe that `extra_data`, `mix_hash` and `nonce` could be removed without breaking smart contracts that read block header fields as they are last three fields of block structure for the moment, after London the last one will be `base_fee_per_gas` but it is exposed by the `BASEFEE` opcode. The `difficulty` field is right before the `number`, so, removing it is potentially breaking change for this kind of contracts. \n\nAnd if we consider removing those three fields then `difficulty` would be a perfect place for `randao`.\n\ncc \u003c@!211091239112671234\u003e \u003c@!301186049323958275\u003e",
