I'm trying to better guage how the AA teams need to be thinking about internal R\u0026D work. You can think of them as AA_TYPE(s) akin to a TX_TYPE... \n\nI say unplanned, because the its one of those things that would move the needle so aggressively forward on UX - its hard to justify \"8 months out\", especially if its a low lift.",
