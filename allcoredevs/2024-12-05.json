        "content": "About the min fee proposal, my sense is that the discussion has mostly focused on one aspect, which is the convenience to L2s. I know other arguments have been mentioned as well (even in the call today), but my impression from talking to other people is that there isn't a clear understanding of what all of them are, so decided to recap them here. The situation we care about is one where the basefee is very low and it takes a very long time to catch up to increased demand, leaving us in a state of priority gas auctions in the meantime. Some of the downsides are:\n1) Bidding is more complicated for L2s. This is imo the point has been discussed the most, but perhaps one of the weakest ones because it is maybe not a huge deal to push some complexity to the L2 bidding process for some time\n2) Fairly charging L2 users for L1 fees is much more complicated without the credible signal given by the basefee.\n3) The blob mempool becomes the arena for priority gas auctions. This is much worse than for regular transactions given how heavy blob transactions are. We can improve on this by making resubmission harder (and we already do, iirc the priority fee has to be increased by 2x), but this also makes 1) worse.\n4) We can have a long period of max blobs. In theory we're supposed to be able to handle that, but do we really want to?\n\nI understand we most likely won't do it at this point, but I think it's still worth being on the same page about the arguments.",
