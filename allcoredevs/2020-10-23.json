I've discovered some optimizations along the way but I feel the need to ask for input from others who may be interested and/or have more experience optimizing Go code.  Here are some instructions for building and benchmarking both Geth-evm384 and evmone-evm384: https://gist.github.com/jwasinger/41b890bc5a01b7abd4f75ae70f0641f1#file-instructions-md .  \n\nThe TLDR is that Geth-evm384 is currently 3x slower than evmone for a benchmark of our \"synthetic\" pairing algorithm.  The main bottleneck for evm384 is montgomery modular multiplication for which there is a 2x slowdown in Go as compared to C++.  Thus, I have good reason to believe more optimization is possible in the pure Go implementation.\n\nIn addition, based on measuring the component of overhead not due to modular arithmetic, there is a measurable slowdown in Geth's EVM vs evmone, so maybe there are speedups to be found here.\n\nAny suggestions/input are appreciated.",
