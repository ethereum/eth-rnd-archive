By EONW we should have an announcement for the Sepolia Merge, which we'll target for July 6\n2. **Next ACD will be the last ACD to be at Friday 14:00 UTC**. After that, we'll move to Thursday 14:00 UTC to better accommodate APAC folks. So, next call still Friday (July 8), but after that we'll do Thursdays (e.g. call after July 8th is July 21st, then Aug 4th, Aug 18th, etc.)\n3. MSF8 will also happen on the first week of July, configs should be out next week 😄",
