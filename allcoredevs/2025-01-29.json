        "content": "For your consideration prior to ACDE tomorrow:\n\nBesu team has discussed it- while we could make a Holesky/Sepolia ready release on Feb3rd, it would be tight. We’d really like to see the changes to 7702 (re: EXTCODE*) have some time to digest on devnet6, which hasn’t launched yet. We’re also a little concerned that the transaction propagation specifics for 7702 remain untested, and neither aspect of 7702 has been deployed to Mekong (currently at parity with devnet4) yet, so AA wallet developers haven’t experienced them yet.\n\nAt ACD tomorrow we’re gonna suggest pushing the slots for Holesky/Sepolia out one week, at the minimum.",
