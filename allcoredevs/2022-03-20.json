Requiring them to translate their work into a PR on the Reference Specification as well is a big ask.\n\nRegardless, what goes live is what defines the consensus protocol, and that amounts to a number of PRs by client teams who understood the EIP well enough to make them.  I think the team maintaining the Reference Specification can be trusted to do the same.\n\nAnd none of this really affects the EIP Editors.  The technical quality of the specification is not for us to judge.",
