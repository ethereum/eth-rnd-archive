However, when I cheked some of the other clients, they seem to be all doing the same thing.\n\nThis is the part of the spec that got us confused (reference https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/deneb/p2p-interface.md#topics-and-messages)\n\n\u003e The voluntary_exit topic is implicitly modified due to the lock-in use of CAPELLA_FORK_VERSION for this message signature validation for EIP-7044.",
