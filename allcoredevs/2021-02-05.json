Im not super excited about upgrading all our testnet infrastructure to brand new point release in such a small window, especially since we also potentially have to make other changes to our infra beyond just upgrading the nodes around supporting 2718/2930 (which is dependent on JSONRPC changes that don't have an EIP associated with yet).",

        "content": "ok, after going through the RPC list its actually a subset of the EIP-1559 list:\n\n```\nSingle transaction RPCs that need to include access list if targeting a 2930 tx:\n\n eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex\n eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex\n eth_getTransactionByHash\n\nBlock RPCs which need to include access list if block contains any 2930 txs (and \"full\" param is true):\n\n eth_getBlockByHash \n eth_getBlockByNumber\n\nNot sure about transaction receipts:\n\n eth_getTransactionReceipt - ??? I don't _think_ access list needs to be included in receipt\n \nNo changes for 2930 to uncle RPCs since they only return the block header not tx bodies:\n\n eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex\n eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex\n eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex\n```\n\nI'm not sure if there'd be any value in including the access list in the transaction receipt response.  I lean towards not including it but could definitely be convinced otherwise.\n\nGoing forward though, I'm concerned about the general ability for these existing RPCs to continue to evolve to include new transaction types as they are added, IMO writing the encoders and decoders for these are going to get very messy unless the transaction type field is made a first-class citizen of the JSON schema.  Many of the same arguments for adding a tx type prefix to the RLP format apply equally to partitioning the JSON schema for transactions by type somehow.",
