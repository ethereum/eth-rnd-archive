I needed a chance to check the manuals to be sure I had it right.\n\nThe JVM has _jsr_ and _ret_ instructions that were once used for implementing _finally_ clauses.  These are not subroutines in the usual sense, despite their names and descriptions.  Those are supported by a set of _invoke_ and _return_ opcodes.  _invokestatic_ amounts to a direct subroutine call - it is defined within a class, but not bound to an object.  The remainder are bound to objects.\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokestatic\n\nWasm, on the other hand, supports _call_, which is a direct subroutine call,  and *call_indirect* which calls through a table of functions.\nhttps://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/instructions.html#syntax-instr-control\n\n*JUMPSUB*, since it takes its argument on the stack, can be used for direct or indirect calls, depending on whether its argument is constant.",

I thought that a second stack should be avoided on modern hardware to prevent stack collision and thrashing. I wonder why Forth has a second stack..\n\nThe designer of Forth also had hardware ambitions, and owns a hardware company which implements Forth in hardware!\n\nForth cpus do not use registers, but stacks. In hardware, a second stack may not be such a bad idea. For example, in hardware, one can implement interrupts to handle stack overflow/underflow/collision. In hardware, one can use the second stack to implement jump pre-fetching tricks (as we saw with RISC-V above).\n\nOf course, there are down-sides of stacks in hardware, in particular the size limits, and possible thrashing if overflows are put in memory.\n\nI think that we should celebrate the history and ingenuity of Forth, especially since it influenced Bitcoin Script which influenced EVM.\n\nBut we should not base a second stack design on something with which had different ambitions and limitations.\n\nOne interesting fact about Forth hardware -- it is popular for space exploration!",

The new approach is to separate the two processes: EIP as technical specification, and hard fork coordination. However I'm strongly in favour that an EIP should not be considered for a fork unless it is in a stable state. I would argue that \"Review\" is the minimum status to consider it for discussion in a hard fork, \"Last Call\" is the minimum status to consider it for last round of fork planning, and ideally it is \"Final\" before the fork numbers are set.",

For myself, I am left to seriously reconsider my future involvement with the Ethereum project. And to seriously question whether I could in good conscience advise others to participate. Unless they enjoy chaos and disappointment.\n\nIt is true that a single technical concern (whether to bear the cost to prevent branching into subroutines) remained active for some time after initial acceptance, as I attempted to give it the best consideration I could. In the end, as author, I made the choice not to accept the change, for reasons I stated at the time -- from the very start I meant this proposal to be a very small change to provide subroutines with Forth semantics, and not to impose syntactic restrictions.\n\nThe issue was not raised again until Christian made a comment - not on the ACD channel, but on Twitter - that for him it remained a blocking objection. That objection left me - unprepared and at the last minute - trying to field objections and explain decisions long since made. I should not have needed to do that.",

And there aren't many of these teams. Until we get to such scale, it might be more useful to have a process which does not use abstract terms, but very concrete entities and people, for example, go-ethereum, Peter, Martin, Tomasz, Nethermind, and so on. Yes, this means the process can be asymmetric, but it might be much more honest and efficient this way. If we lucky enough that this process becomes so large and list of people involved too big, we can generalise it and express it in more abstract terms.

        "content": "Hi guys, two points: \n\n(1) Can we get a London hardfork readme in https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs ? I can track the scheduled HFs via `ethereum/pm` but it would be helpful if we keep a document updated so we all know what EIPs are (considered to be) included in London\n(2) I don't like that the agenda's of core dev calls are not an issue anymore, since there is no clear way to now respond to the agenda via GitHub (you can basically only do it here). I'd suggest a running issue which could be used as an asynchronous way to communicate any concerns/additions to the agenda (just like before)",
