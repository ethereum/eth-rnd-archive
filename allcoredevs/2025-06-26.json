For one thing, opinions on this have evolved a lot even since Berlin, as people spent more time thinking about the structure of the slot and its consequences, though this might not be legible at this point. There's probably at least 3 or 4 different opinions on this in the room I am sitting in right now, with 4 people 😄",
