Note that not all of these EIPs are in CFI, but are to be discussed in ACD Meeting #95.\n\n- [EIP-2046: Reduced gas cost for static calls made to precompiles](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2046).\n- [EIP-2315: Simple Subroutines for the EVM](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315).\n- [EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537) (already in YOLOv1).\n- [EIP-2711: Sponsored, expiring and batch transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2711).\n- [EIP 2718: Typed Transaction Envelope](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2718.md) (general-purpose standard for adding new transaction types).\n- [EIP-2565: Repricing of the EIP-198 ModExp precompile](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565).\n- [EIP-2929: Gas cost increases for state access opcodes](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2929.md).\n- [EIP-2930: Optional access lists](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2930.md).\n- [EIP-2935: Save historical block hashes in state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935).",

And doing just a safe version of 2046 would be a significant improvement already. The individual precompile repricings I think are cherry on the cake (compared to the staticcall change). I may be wrong and having some example gas costs for actually happening use cases would be nice to see (whether the call cost overhead is a significant contributor or not).",
