Tools that would be useful.  Experiments you would like to see done.  This is a good chance to \"hook\" participants from the next cohort to work on your stuff.",

I'd get 7.5 MB when one creates a tx with only zeros in the calldata. (30.000.000/4) (4 gas per 0 byte). I also can't think of a way to do it via CREATE since you'd run into the quadratic gas scaling of memory.",
