The current set dates for Sepolia (Jan 30) \u0026 Holesky (Feb 7) assume that we put out client releases and an announcement by mid next week. **If, due to how Goerli went yesterday, teams feel like this is too soon, we absolutely need to decide on tomorrow's call. ** Regardless, as \u003c@583892532644151312\u003e pointed out, we should at least get the 4788 contracts deployed on Sepolia and Holesky (maybe we want to wait for mainnet?). \n- Second, we're planning to review the various Prague/Electra proposals, so please have a look at the thread before the call (https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/prague-electra-network-upgrade-meta-thread/16809). Shoutout to \u003c@\u00261070471163219824730\u003e for writing up their views ahead of time: https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/01/ethereum-2024 !\n- Third, on the next ACDE (Feb 1), we'd like to do a deep dive into Verkle, given how big it is. It would be useful for the Verkle folks if tomorrow we could aggregate questions/topics/etc. that people would like to cover, so that they can prepare accordingly. \n\nSee you tomorrow!",
