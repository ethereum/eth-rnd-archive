They had three dimensions (ram, network, and cpu) which amounted to three different ways to spike prices for \"normal use.\" It's likely other issues exacerbated the economic issues (hard limits on ram, the 21 block producer limitation, DPoS voting strategies) and there are mechanisms that can be designed to suppress the negative externalities. But it is \"in the wild\"",
