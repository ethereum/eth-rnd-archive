However bandwidth is something that is very much out of their control, if you live in a country with sub-optimal fibre infrastructure you are stuck with whatever low bandwidth connection your isp provides you with limited room to change. Currently running geth can take up to 5 mib/s with the default number of peers. Increasing this significantly will permanently disqualify a subset of users from ever being able to run a node.",

I live in a big city in a big country, and anyway internet operators are essentially a monopoly. Getting large bandwidth which is not throttled at high speed both ways and with a fixed IP is just plainly impossible unless I open a company and buy an big Enterprise package. And even then I'm at the mercy of whatever the ISP decides. I'm completely sure that this is a reality in many countries not only mine.",
