Thank you to Erigon \u0026 Besu for sharing your preferences about the fork scope (and Reth for doing it a while back!). We'll kickoff with an update on how things are going w.r.t. everything that's already included in Pectra, then talk through clients' preferences for the scope. Note that there have been updates posted on the agenda for EIPs 7667, 7623, and 7645.",
