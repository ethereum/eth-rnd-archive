        "content": "## Testing Call 24/Feb/2025\n\n### MEV:\n- Flashbots identified an [issue](https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1337407251886903347/1342521491899809844) and are working on a fix, aiming for Holesky.\n- Prysm and Nimbus are progressing on **SSZ \u0026 Builder API**: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1341434255154348034/1342278789409013810\n- MEV Tests are using local devnets using kurtosis.\n\n\n### Pectra Mainnet Shadow Fork\n- No progress: Clients could not be synced due to infrastructure issues. \n- There was an issue getting mainnet data to the nodes.\n- Rafael started working on a fix.\n- Expected to be resolved today or tomorrow.\n\n### Client updates on Pectra\n\n#### Erigon, Geth, Teku\n- No updates.\n\n#### Nethermind\n- Marek: still everything good.\n\n#### Besu\n- Daniel: still everything good with the release.\n\n#### Reth\n- Roman: Local nodes updated, no major issues.\n\n#### Prysm\n- James: Looking to merge https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/14896, which is one of the attestation related items. The solution is still being reviewed.\n\n#### Grandine\n- Saulius: A few small fixes, might wait for a few days for a release, but nothing major.\n\n#### Lighthouse\n- Pawan: Lighthouse is still on 7.0.0-beta.0 for holesky.\n\n#### Lodestar\n\n- Potential hot-fix for an issue caught during gnosis testing, which is also relevant for holesky.\n- Issue was not caught by local testing.\n- Issue related to compounding of a validator that is being loaded from DB, and only happens during proposals.\n- https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/7478\n- Nethermind team could share the details regarding the test case that triggers the issue.\n\n### PeerDAS\n- Rafael: Devnet-5, same spec as Devnet-4 and is basically a relaunch, which fixed the client versions issues that caused the problem in Devnet-4.\n- Devnet 5 Tooling: [PeerDAS Dashboard](https://peerdas-devnet-5.ethpandaops.io/)\n\n### EOF\n\n- Danno: Devnet-0 is a success 🎉\n- 3+ clients in sync in the Devnet-0.\n- Reth fell out for a bit but caught up afterwards.\n- Devnet-1 will contain all EIP changes, and will be longer lived than Devnet-0 to allow public access to deploy and test EOF contracts.\n- Evmone will have a proof-of-concept for TXCREATE over the next couple of weeks, which will allow EEST to fill tests and make fixes.\n- Rafael: Suggested having a hive dashboard for the status of the clients passing EOF tests.\n- Requires an EOF EEST release. Mario will work on this.",
