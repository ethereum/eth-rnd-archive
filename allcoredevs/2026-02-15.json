    "content": "I disagree that Frame Transactions (EIP-8141) is only about a theoretical intermediate step. It changes the rules so that accounts are in charge of validating their own transactions. This means we basically never have to change the tx signature again because it completely removes the concept of signatures from the core protocol. \n\nTo make PQ signatures viable, the protocol will move to provide building blocks such as precompiles for relevant signature algorithms.\n\nHowever, you are also right in that the EOA transition still has to occur eventually. EIP-8141 does not fully solve quantum computer readiness because the existing ECDSA keys will keep working for the time being. Schemes for migrating EOAs off of ECDSA are still being designed.",
