If we change it to `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, then we are back to using 2/3 of the terms from the spec directly (incl. `baseFeePerGas`) and we should probably use 3/3 to be consistent. \n\nOTOH, those terms are verbose and that was one of the reason noted by geth against them in their original writeup and why they proposed `gasFeeCap` \u0026 `gasTipCap` ♻️ \n\nWe _can_ discuss this on ACD this Friday, but my fear is we end up taking a bunch of time on the call going in circle, so if anyone has ideas about how to \"unblock\" this, I'm all ears. \n\nIn the meantime, \u003c@!104006934562107392\u003e has a PR for the JSON RPC spec changes: https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/pull/47#pullrequestreview-656816106 the format should be relatively final, but the naming obviously may still change.",
