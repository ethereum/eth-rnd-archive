It's counter-intuitive, but that's how it works. (See this: https://medium.com/coinmonks/adventures-in-difficulty-bombing-837890476630).\n\n500,000 blocks is about 10 weeks. 10 weeks from now, the bomb will be where it is now even if you wait three three weeks to do the fork.\n\nThe only thing \"when\" effects is how painful it gets before you fork.",
