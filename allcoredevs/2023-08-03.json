By the testing call Monday, we'll try and (1) agree to a deployment scheme (as part of the fork or manually before), (2) agree to a first contract implementation to use and (3) have a PR to the 4788 spec reflecting this. Follow the conversation in \u003c#753271902520213625\u003e. Once we have a contract agreed to, we'll get an audit/formal verification process started. \n- We'll hold devnet 8's launch until we have implementations for the new 4788 spec. \n- **EIP-6780**: we'll go ahead and merge the clarifications from https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7308\n- **Engine API**: we agreed to merge https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/398 \u0026 https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/451. \n- We'll modify this PR to mention that `forkChoiceUpdateV3` is mandatory for Dencun, and then get it merged: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/426 \n- **Large Validator Testnet:** the EF devops team launched a devnet with 2.1m validators, with a similar client distribution to mainnet. They ran into some finalization + block gossip issues, and will be working with client teams to diagnose/fix those in advance of the Holesky launch, which is planned to have ~1.5m validators\n- Two Account Abstraction EIPs were presented and discussed: 5806 \u0026. 7377\n- \u003c@353136597522448385\u003e and \u003c@1010280066028142662\u003e gave an update on the state of Verkle: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hgke4EHtjHBaYrIA6WbToGip6eho6INBgvwG76BIw1M/edit#slide=id.p",
