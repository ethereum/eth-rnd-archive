So the algorithm could look like:\n\n```\nAlgorithm PackNextChunk\ninputs: tail_length:uint5, tail_path_as_int:u25, common_length:uint5\noutput: tail_length | tail_path_as_int\u003c\u003c5 | common_length \u003c\u003c (5 + tail_length)\n        Where `|` is the logical or operator, \u003c\u003c is the left bit-shift operator, and + is addition.\n```\n\nOr you can define it as a grammar (slightly different encoding for convenience):\n\n```\nencoded_path := common_length:\u003cuint5\u003e tail_length:\u003cuint5\u003e tail_path_as_int:\u003cuint32\u003e \n                where common_length+tail_length==25 and length(tail_path_as_int)==tail_length\nuint5 := 0 | 1 | ... | 31\nuint32 := 0 | 1 | ... | 2^(32)-1\n```",

Maybe also see how latex allows rendering algorithms or grammars, to see what is commonly used in practice. Or textbooks on the topics will usually use good notation and render things nicely.",
