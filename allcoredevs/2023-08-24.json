        "content": "Listening to the consensus call about the Holesky genesis state. I suggest hosting the genesis state *uncompressed* on a server with a path that looks like the beacon API (eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/genesis). You can use a stock checkpointz server or fake it with an S3 bucket. This way we’re not creating one-off solutions for Holesky that need a new server type. Rather, we’re using existing infra and the solution immediately applies retroactively to existing testnets. I’ve tested all the checkpoint sync servers I could find on Prater and they all provide the genesis state. That means we can drop the Prater genesis from our binaries too (we plan to do that in the next release).",
