It has been made as a claim several times in their favor, but I haven't seen anyone make a sound argument as to why this is true.\n\nThe top argument is that the leading `gas` does this, like `gasPrice`, but this is simply untrue.  It is the `Price` in `gasPrice` that lets you know it is per gas.",
