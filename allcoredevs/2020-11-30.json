Since SSZ gives us schemas, serialization, merklization and hashing, it is useful to think of it as a building block for simplifying the overall protocol.  These are common \"tools\" that are regularly needed when trying to specify parts of the protocol.  If we use SSZ, we can lean on a common toolbox for specifying the protocols which should make our specifications simpler since they can use an SSZ schema for defining the data structures involved and automatically get well defined serializations, merklization, and hashing for free (without having to explicitely define how to do each of these things).",
