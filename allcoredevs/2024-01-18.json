        "content": "**ACDE Recap** - this was a big one, so brace yourselves! \n\n**Dencun**\n- Teams are satisfied with how Goerli went: issues have already been triaged, fixed, and new releases shipped. We are therefore keeping our Sepolia/Holesky schedule. **Client teams should have a release out with activation set for both testnets by early next week**. See EIP-7569 for epochs/timestamps. CL spec was just released, too (see \u003c#595701770034872362\u003e )\n- We tentatively agreed to move forward with this JSON RPC PR (https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/486) once (1) we've merged the 4844 naming changes (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8095) and updated the PR to reflect those, and (2) ideally have \u003c@388751025789468672\u003e (or another future user!) confirm that the JSON RPC PR looks good 😄 \n- We're good to deploy the 4788 contract to mainnet. First one to do this and post a txn hash here gets their gas refunded ⛽ \n\n**Prague/Electra**\n- Lots of conversation on the call, won't summarize everything here. If you care about what's going in the fork, make sure you watch the recording! \n- EL teams agreed that we should aim to do a fork in 2024, which likely means excluding Verkle and having it in the next fork. That said, there is likely bandwidth for one \"harder thing\" in that fork. \n- All EL teams agreed that 2537, 6110 and 7002 should be prioritized in the next fork. I've drafted a Meta EIP to reflect this, and given 2/3rd of these EIPs also involve the CL and we didn't get a formal +1 from them, I've put all 3 in the \"CFI\" bucket for now: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8121 \n- On the next ACDE, we'll discuss the 3 potential \"big things\": Verkle, EOF and 4444. If you have specific questions/points you'd like to cover about those, please raise them on either the call agenda (https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/943), here, or with the champions for those initiatives. \n\nHopefully, after that we have a feel for where Verkle should go, and what space is left in Prague!",
