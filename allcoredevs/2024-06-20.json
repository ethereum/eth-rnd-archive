Various implementation stages being tracked here (https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/blob/main/spec/implementation_matrix.md), and Erigon said it would be nice to have some EOF blocks to test with soon\n- PeerDAS devnets will be based on CL spec `v1.5.0-alpha.3`, expected to launch in the next few weeks\n- I proposed a template for `discussions-to` threads on EthMag (https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/template-for-discussion-to-threads/20347), if teams have suggestions on it, please share, otherwise, we'll get it added 🔜 \n- Pari is looking for EL admins for the `eth-clients` repo, see the thread above for context ( https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/745077610685661265/1253284105358147648) \n- Next ACDE is happening as scheduled on July 4th, but \u003c@539495253418180618\u003e will be running it. Have fun 😄 !",
