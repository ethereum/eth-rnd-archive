Do they rush and risk bugs? Do they tell all node operators using their client to switch to other clients, increasing the marketshare of those clients? That's a slippery slope where it'd be hard to get marketshare back",

There's definitely a cost to switching, and that cost grows based on usage, but it's neither 0 nor infinite. \n\nIf a client is \"days\" behind, we should obviously wait, \"weeks\", almost certainly wait, but if a client was \"months\" behind, I don't know that we should hold off upgrading the entire network because of that, even if it had a large market share. \n\nAt the extreme, if a majority clients was \"years\" behind (effectively deprecated?), we should obviously keep going. The closest thing we got to that last scenario was the Parity deprecation, and in practice they gave people plenty of heads up to migrate, worked with other client teams to create easier switchover paths, etc.",
