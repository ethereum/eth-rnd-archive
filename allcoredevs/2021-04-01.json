Berlin updates: mainnet fork is happening between tomorrow's call and the next - \u003c@!642887713246150666\u003e is organizing a Cat Herders community call to watch the fork 😄 Also, the Berlin EIPs should all be in Last Call (cc: \u003c@!211091239112671234\u003e \u003c@!301186049323958275\u003e)\n2. London updates: progress on 1559 implementation, can we get LONDON-YOLO up between the next calls? Status of reference tests for 1559. \n3. Shanghai \u0026 The Merge: what are clients' PoV about what the Shanghai focus should be. If it's the Merge, what EIPs from the list in (4) in the agenda should we potentially consider for London? In what order? \n4. List of EIPs being proposed: 3403 (remove refunds), 3198 (`BASE FEE` opcode), 3074 (`AUTH` \u0026 `AUTHCALL`), 2537 (BLS precompile, and an EVM384 update), 2327 (`BEGINDATA` opcode), 2677 (limit size of `initcode`), 2935 (historical block hashes in state). All of these have issues lined in the agenda",
