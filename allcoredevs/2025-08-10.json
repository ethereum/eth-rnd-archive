        "content": "gm folks - sorry for hijacking this channel, but it's too important to share somewhere else. We (in this context SEAL 911) have seen way too many tech-savvy people being completely compromised via infostealer malware in the last few weeks. Just some examples:\n- Fake language extensions (e.g. https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1954131092191027662),\n- Fake wallet extensions (e.g. https://blog.koi.security/greedy-bear-massive-crypto-wallet-attack-spans-across-multiple-vectors-3e8628831a05),\n- Fake SDK updates (e.g. https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/macos-nimdoor-dprk-threat-actors-target-web3-and-crypto-platforms-with-nim-based-malware/).\n\nGuys, I know you're all pros, but this is an important reminder that you _must_ always verify what you download, even when you're rushed or distracted. Harden your setup so that if you do get compromised (let's not hope for it but plan for this scenario nonetheless), it doesn't instantly wreck you. Remember: infostealers target - besides other things - your hot wallets, not your hardware wallets.\n\nI love you core devs - I'd much rather debate EOF or privacy with you than walk you through wiping a compromised machine. So please stay vigilant. ❤️",
