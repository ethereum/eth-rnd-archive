Luckily, I missed the naming discussion on the latest ACD, but I might still offer a suggestion on how to short-cut this. It looks like there are a few people who think naming is super important, but they cannot agree without appealing to a \"court of higher authority\", which is in this case ACD. Implicitly (without saying it), they are probably looking to agree with some specific persons on the call, for example, Martin or Peter (definitely not me 🙂 ). So if this is the case, these can be resolved easily by just letting these specific persons decide in whatever form they like. Or say \"I don't care\". Listening to the last parts of the call, I thought that the issue which did not get enough attention but should have done, is the transaction pool behaviour under EIP-1559. You may say this is the proverbial atomic power plant in the bike-shedding story 🙂",
