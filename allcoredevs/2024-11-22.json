I know we’re late in the process, and in most cases, I’m against making changes at this stage, but:\n-We’re still discussing adding 7742 along with the blob increase.\n-7623 is very simple to implement and is probably already implemented by most (if not all) clients.\n-Since we’re considering increasing the blob count, this EIP helps reduce the maximum block sizes for blocks.\n-Regardless of opinions about increasing the gas limit, we don’t control this value, and reducing the maximum worst-case block sizes aligns well with a potential gas limit increase.\n\nThis is a small EIP with a huge positive impact.",

Unless this changes the distribution of the kinds of transactions we get (i.e. reduce the number with large calldata and replace it with more transactions with less calldata) all this would do would be to reduce the total number of transactions (which does reduce block size).",
