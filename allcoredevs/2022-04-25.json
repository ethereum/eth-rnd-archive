Based on this blog: https://hackmd.io/@tvanepps/1559-wallets\n\nHow gas fees are determined for ETH2 is that if the previous block is more than 50% full, it will increase the gas fees by 12.5%, if less than 50% full, it will decrease gas fees by 12.5%, and is block is 50% full, gas fees remain same. Then there is an example of 100% and 0% where gas fees increase and decrease respectively.\n\nSo if block is 51% on every block, gas fees will just keep increasing by 12.5% continuously? This doesn't seem right, I think I am missing something here 😅",
