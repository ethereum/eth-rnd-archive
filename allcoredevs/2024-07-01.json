Had few aligned doubts, li'l basic though. But would be great if someone to clear out:\n1. What are the future steps if the validator client data is once available?\n2. How will client diversity be ensured if the client data is available, since the choice is open to the validators?\n3. If we are concerned with client diversity, can't we have some sort of channel or aggregator of clients to which a validator connects rather than connecting to a client and which in turn directs the validators towards a particular client based on the factors like availability, usage etc?",
