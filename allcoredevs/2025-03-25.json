Getting to a resolution on EOF's status for Fusaka is the most important thing for **ACDE this week. All EL teams should review the following documents in advance of the call and come prepared to share their view:** \n\n1. Ipsilon's Fusaka EOF options: https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/eof_fusaka_options\n2. Concerns about EOF complexity: https://hackmd.io/@pcaversaccio/eof-when-complexity-outweighs-necessity\n3. Alternate Fusaka EVM improvement proposal by \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9501\n\nWe agreed to finalize the Fusaka scope by April 10 (ACDE in 2 weeks). Having a clear decision about EOF this Thursday will allow us to meet that deadline, giving teams an extra few weeks to then adjust their preferences based on the scope for the fork.",
