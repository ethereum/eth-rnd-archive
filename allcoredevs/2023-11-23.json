        "content": "**ACDE Call Recap**\n- Devnet 11 is mostly stable, small peering issue between EthJS and Lodestar, tested some new Lighthouse changes (QUIC). MEV-boost is being tested on Lodestar \u0026 Nimbus, hoping to have all clients tested by EOW. \n- **Devnet 12: we agreed to launch it next week, even if we don't have all clients on it, as long as we have 3+ CLs.** Teku \u0026 Lodestar said on the call they were ready. Someone external to Lighthouse said they _should_ be ready. We'll discuss this on Monday's testing call further. Ideally, we can launch it before ACDC next week to get some initial data. At the very least, we'll be running Kurtosis with all ready clients. \n- We discussed this execution APIs spec issue: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/493. No objection to the spec change, with a small piece of feedback that we should be explicit about all cases which should not be possible. It's unclear if we can set up good tests for this, but ELs running into an issue where a previously `INVALID` payload gets marked as `VALID` should treat this as a high priority issue which could potentially cause a network split. \n- **Goerli:** after some back and forth, we agreed that client teams and EF devops will stop running their Goerli validators the **later of 3 months after the Goerli Dencun fork, or 1 month after the mainnet Dencun fork**. After this, users should expect one month of \"chaos testing\" as we withdraw/leak/slash the existing validators. \n- Finally, \u003c@301186049323958275\u003e came on to present `eth_multicall`, which both Geth and Nethermind have implemented, and are now looking for feedback from other EL teams on. PR for the change is here: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/484, which also links to a nice presentation explaining the rationale 🙂  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lEaqHTY3ud8pe6VAFwLkb-jdoHpTMBfuF1K9OKy-azs/edit#slide=id.g29706cecfe6_0_24\n\nSee you on the Monday testing call: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/908 😄 !",
