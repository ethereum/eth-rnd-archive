(`wasmsnark`  is deprecated as it's inegrated in snarkjs and all the wasm code is maintained in `wasmcurves` repo).  \nI used this paper to do the check the group in G1 and G2: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/814.pdf\nI've not benchmark it, But I believe it should not affact too much compared to the pairing calculation.",
