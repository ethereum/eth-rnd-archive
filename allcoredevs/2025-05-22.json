With Holesky scheduled to sunset on September 30, 2025, we wanted to raise a potential path forward for discussion.\n\nUsing Celo as one example: we recently transitioned to an Ethereum L2 architecture, and both our testnets currently depend on Holesky. Based on the current timeline, we’d need to migrate to Sepolia in the short term — only to migrate again when Sepolia is deprecated a year later. This creates added overhead and complexity not just for us, but likely for others in a similar position.\n\nTo simplify testnet maintenance, we’d like to propose extending Holesky’s lifespan. This would allow projects to align directly with Sepolia’s successor, while also ensuring sufficient overlap for a smooth migration.\n\nWe’d love to hear what others think — especially teams that are also building on or relying on Holesky today. Would an extension be helpful? Are there alternative paths we should be considering?\n\nWe’re also curious whether the Ethereum Foundation and broader community would be open to this idea. And if not, what guidance you might have for teams navigating the transition.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts — thanks for the discussion",

For EIP-7825 (gas limit tx cap) we could also consider limiting to `2^16-1 = 16_777_215`, (instead of 30M) this would make the gas limit cap fit within a `bytes2` / `uint16` thus a slight benefit to quickly reject it at txpool level. Downside is that current full-block txs are invalid (plus that this indirectly limits the practical max contract size to deploy due to calldata+code deposit gas cost)\n\nSee https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7825-transaction-gas-limit-cap/21848/3?u=jochem-brouwer",
