I would not say that delaying it longer would necessarily lead to a better process, there are big downsides to that too and I don't envy \u003c@552133098075193354\u003e's tough position in making that call, but it may have affected the outcome in some ways. As an example, I asked Certora to state their position, since they develop the kind of tools that should benefit from EOF. It seems that they were preparing to do so anyway, but the post went out only today: [Static Analysis Deserves a Seat at the Table](https://www.certora.com/blog/static-analysis-eof-response).\n\nWhile it looks like they did not want to speak out for or against EOF specifically, they do take issue with static analysis being dismissed as irrelevant by the anti-EOF camp and show how the removal of dynamic jumps would matter a lot to them. This is a core part of both EOF and \u003c@683653554631868440\u003e's earlier proposals.\n\nIt generally seems to me that there was a pretty sudden shift in dev opinion on social media over the weekend to anti-EOF after some prominent devs switched their opinions and people who were in support of the proposal were late to catch up.",

Is Risk-V now part of the strategy? Perhaps at this point it is not enough to just throw things in, and hope that someone will pick it up. The difference between strategy and wishful thinking is that the former assumes limited resources, but the latter assumes unlimited resources or miracles.

Formal verification was never emphasized over and is only now being touted as the real benefit of EOF, and the question still is if its the 10X gain the dapp community is looking for i.e. lack of formal verification is something that is holding them back.\n\nthe hard questions that we are asking today were not asked at the time of EOF SFI (and that may be part of process evolution or the current environment) but I can distinctly remember that verkle was pushed out by EOF because supposedly verkle was \"not ready\" or we were not certain what flavor of statelessness we wanted or were asking verkle/stateless to show how its a 10X feature.\n\nSo all these similar unanswered  questions even now for EOF after a year of SFI are hence a valid line of questioning and again imo EOF failed to answer it. So it was no surprize to me what happened on Monday and it was not just a random event or a vocal minority.\n\nSteve Jobs turned around apple not by saying yes, but by saying No. so if we have to say no to all those complex features which don't give 10X jump on our endgame, it should be a No.\n\nI am less convinced about the readiness argument because spec always evolve when you get down to implement it and all worthwhile/future looking proposals have a learning curve. But it shouldn't be because of something that should have been known from day 1(gas introspection). EOF champions lack of engagement with the app community (and yes its the champions responsibility with ACD helping them provide platfform to do an outreach) also didn't help.\n\nIn above conversations only there have been mentions of how the app community was derided or at best ignored by the EOF champions.",

What is the current holistic approach to ensure that we don't lose home stakers in the future?\n\nWe normally only discuss one proposal at a time, but putting several proposals together let's me think that we might have issues to retain home stakers in the future. For example the following issues:\n\n1) Raising hardware requirements for stakers: Dankrad mentioned a 10k USD target for home stakers, maybe that is cheaper depending on which node it is\n2) Changes to the issuance curve: Most proposals want to keep staked ETH low and the issuance go to zero sooner or later.\n3) Home stakers that still can build blocks can get tips from the tx that they include. But at the same time the public mem pool is bleeding out and it seems nothing about that will change in the future\n\nWhy would any rational person stake from home at this point, if they don't get paid (issuance = 0, tips for txs ~0), have high initial costs and risk to lose their stake if they make a mistake and get slashed, or their clients happens to be a \u003e 2/3 majority client and it has a bug?",

While some even joked that EOF may even be ready before PeerDAS.\n\nWhat I think may have happened on Monday's call is that there is some new unknowns being brought forward regarding the readiness of EOF, that may again take more time to finalize the scope of the Fusaka Fork. Which resulted into a decision to take EOF out before it introduces further debates and delays to Fusaka. (Note I haven't had time to watch the Monday's call, just the previous ACDE's and ACDC)\n\nThough what I understand as well is that EOF is not rejected, but may be considered in future forks.

        "content": "My perspective on what happened:\n\nUntil recently, there was a weak and relatively fragile consensus in favour of going ahead with \"Complete EOF\" (Option A). Then there were complaints that part of EOF (banning gas and extcode introspection) would break so much current Solidity code that it would be unusable and everyone would be forced to continue using the legacy EVM. This came up during ACDE on 24th April, because we are so close to freezing Osaka and deploying the first devnets there wasn't time to delay the decision to ACDE on 8th May and so it was scheduled to be made at the testing call on the 28th. This is a fairly standard practice for making urgent decisions.\n\nAt the testing call, Ipsilon presented an options paper with 4 options, although only two had a serious chance of achieving consensus:\n\nA: Complete EOF, same as before accept possible day 1 unusability.\nD: Introspecting EOF, remove the \"bans\" causing the issue and keep everything else.\n\nEOF then lost consensus for two reasons. Firstly, several people on or close to the fence got uncertain and became actively opposed. Secondly, the coalition backing EOF got split between people who would only accept A (because, if we don't ban introspection now, we have to introduce EOFv2 to ban it later) and people who would only accept D (because A would cause major dev tooling breakage). This is a general property of group decision making, a group of people who individually hold logically consistent views can be collectively irrational. There can be a majority support for EOF in general and majority opposition to every individual form of EOF.\n\nFaced with no immediate consensus on the way forward, the only choice was to delay Fusaka while the issues got worked out or drop EOF from Fusaka. Given the overwhelming consensus about the importance of not delaying PeerDAS, EOF had to be dropped. No decision was made about the longer term future of EOF.",
