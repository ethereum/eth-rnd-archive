I have been searching high and low for the last 3 or 4 days, trying to find out how to submit a 1559 style transaction, and I can find NOTHING!  The main javascript web3 package has no support for 1559.  They only opened a github issue on it a few weeks ago.   Metamask does not support 1559.  They opened a github issue on it 4 days ago.   Etherscan appeared to have no support for 1559 yesterday, although today I noticed they are now supporting the new fields.  Honestly guys, this seems like a pretty strange way to roll out a major new feature.  I wouldn't even *think* about setting a block number for mainnet until all of the above projects are ready, and a whole lot of other as well.",
