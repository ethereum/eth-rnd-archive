        "content": "I have very little evidence, but the fact that the majority of the problems happen on slot 1 trying to reorg slot 0 points to problems on gossip validation (and a cache miss at epoch boundary)  more than validators purposefully proposing late. This was the case early with a double bug at prysm that would delay gossip of those blocks under certain conditions and in the latter weeks it may have been an issue with the latest lighthouse release. (Possible) bugs aside, we are really at the boundaries of what we seem to be able to handle, we are seeing epochs on which the first three or 4 blocks are coming late trying to reorg each other, each reorg is a cache slot that it's useless and if there are enough or if by any circumstances the nodes are stressed, we risk higher and higher block validation time. We are seeing blocks that take over 2 seconds to validate because we need to rehash the entire trie for example. This is not the norm, but the danger here is that we may accumulate this with other issues into a regime change like what happened with those late attestations a couple of months back. I do think that the 4 seconds limit needs to be revisited very soon",
