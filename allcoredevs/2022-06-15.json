Over time, as the newer EL clients gain more market share (as they mature and get battle-tested), then they naturally become more critical in sense of \"being free of bugs\" - but today IMO their value add is really the extra optionality for stakers.  This might be controversial, but IMO Ropsten proved the network as a whole is ready to go, and we should skip having Goerli + Sepolia as a \"pre-requisite\" to go mainnet as its causing a lot of extra work with little added value (e.g., instead of new ELs spending time fixing the last issues, time needs to be devoted coordinating all the testnet transitions). The whole point of having multiple clients is that its okay and expected to have a few issues, *especially* in the case of a minority client..",
