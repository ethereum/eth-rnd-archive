Later today or tomorrow I'll try and do some digging to see if I can populate more info myself 👍",

Added to the agenda. \n\nSecond, potentially having a \"London Infrastructure\" call next week for folks working on tooling to come and share progress/concerns/etc. about London support. \n\nThird, having an #infrastructure channel for projects to come in and ask questions (given it can be hard to know exactly where to do this, and that we may not want to use \u003c#745077610685661265\u003e for it). \n\nThoughts?",
