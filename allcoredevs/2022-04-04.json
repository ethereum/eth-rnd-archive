You guys have literally released it to Kiln and your discussions are talking about rushing through the public test nets  before the difficulty bomb goes off. This is literally the livelihood of millions of people so why rush it?",

It is all well and good to do it in a closed test net but public is going to be even bigger.. and by your statement then it should be another 5+months which does take us over the bomb delay. No need to be abusive towards me either I am just asking a question and although I may not be up to speed on everything I do keep up to date on how the project is going.",
