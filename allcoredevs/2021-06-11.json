        "content": "TL;DR of the decisions made in ACD today:\n\nRe: JSON RPC, for `eth_call` we'll be going with the approach proposed in the PR linked above by Martin. For `effectiveGasPrice`, we'll be adding it to the transaction receipt as per https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/pull/206. For the priorityFee, we'll be going with \u003c@!202397237962211328\u003e's `feeHistory` proposal (https://gist.github.com/zsfelfoldi/473e29106d38525de6b4413e2ebcddf1), but capping the maximum number of blocks for which we return data to accommodate light clients. \n\nFor London, we've agreed on these testnet blocks: \n- Ropsten: `10499401`\n- Goerli: `5062605` \n- Rinkeby: `8897988` \n\nAlso, we discussed EIP-3607 (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3607) which adds a clarification to how transactions are validated. Because this only requires a soft fork vs. a hard fork, clients can implement it when they feel is best for them. Before that, we will just run a full sync with this change to make sure there have never cases breaking this on mainnet. \u003c@!360491619402776577\u003e will open up a PR against the YP with these changes.",
