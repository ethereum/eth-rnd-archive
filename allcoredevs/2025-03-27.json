So each client is slowly going their own route in trying to slowly implement mitigation tactics. Prysm has opened a series of issues and we have merged a couple of PRs allowing blocks to be blacklisted, LH and others can start from an unfinalized checkpoint, etc... But these are being produced without a central coordination of the features. Even though it goes against the eth/acc movement of the latest few weeks (years?) we do need to take a few months to breathe and think about these issues with some perspective and actual time for implementation",

While core devs think of networks like Holesky as testnets, fit for breaking, applications and service providers think of them as where they test their deployments before going to production. This incongruity needs to be corrected, so both audiences may be served during our development lifecycle.\n\nAnd a super good point 🙂",

Will also follow up with infra/app teams by then to flag issues. \n  - We'll be using the template in Fredrik's fork process to coordinate the fork (https://github.com/ethereum/pm/pull/1409)\n  - We'll wait until Fusaka to try out https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7910\n\n2. Fusaka: \n  - After a lot of back and forth: **EOF remains in Fusaka, with Option A from this doc** : https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/eof_fusaka_options#A---Complete-EOF. All EIPs from `devnet-0` will be SFI'd, and those from `devnet-1` and `devnet-2` will be CFI'd. PR incoming from Danno. \n  - Most EL client teams have already shared their fork scoping preference, with EIP-7883 unanimously favored. Will CFI this too. \n  - On next ACDE, we'll finalize Fusaka scoping. The scope should reflect shipping Fusaka by EOY, and we should not add anything that could delay PeerDAS. \n\n3. History Expiry\n  - Due to the EIP-6110 issues, we've agreed to delay dropping pre-merge history on mainnet until after Pectra. \n  - We agreed to a May 1st deadline to drop pre-merge history on Sepolia. Piper will draft an informational EIP with this info to add it to the Fusaka Meta EIP. \n  - We ran out of time to discuss the other topics on the agenda. \n\n4. Barnabé and Ansgar announced the Protocol Reseach Call (first one next Wed 14:00 UTC): https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/protocol-research-call/23261\n\n5.
