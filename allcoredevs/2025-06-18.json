Happy to share a list of teams if you'd like to see the evidence.\n\n7954 is great alternative but not our first preference by a wide margin. I'm not caught up on the latest discussions relating to the  DoS vectors/risks with 7907 but i would definitely advocate for us to strongly consider keeping 7907",
