And \u003c@425274498732916736\u003e  did say something quite interesting at the end - that not a single minute was spent on discussing the core part of the EOF, which may be showing that it is pretty transparent to the applications, as designed. Also, I realised that Danno's article written on the 25th of April was not shown: https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/eof-ethereums-gateway-to-risc-v. \u003c@273808422753796097\u003e  linked it in today's \"simple\" post. However, it is not clear from the post whether the author (vitalik) agrees or disagrees with Danno that the transition from EVM to RISCV would require the \"core\" of EOF (what Pawel mentioned), or something with a different name.",
