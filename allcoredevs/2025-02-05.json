        "content": "About this schedule, i dont see the reasoning behind the +30 days from time of the sepolia fork, my understanding is, L2s and bridges need 30 days upfront notice from the time we decide on the mainnet fork time, and not from sepolia fork time. so assuming we are deciding on the fork schedule Today/tomorrow, it would be very reasonable to choose mid March for the mainnet fork. this should give them around 45 days to pass governance and so on. Additionally, if we decide after testing on holesky and sepolia to delay the mainnet fork for whatever reason, they can simply cancel the existing upgrade transaction and issue a new one to pass through governance again once a mainnet fork time is decided for the second time.",
