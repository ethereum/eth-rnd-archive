Once Light Portal Network Clients are fully operational perhaps that can target the demographic I care about, while \"full node\" developers can focus on targeting validators.  Unfortunately, we aren't quite there yet with Portal Network and I feel like we should not add any *additional* growth until that is complete and fully integrated.  This would apply pressure to everyone to get Portal Network fully operational so they can have their gas limit increases.  If we give the gas limit increases first, I fear that we'll keep dragging our feet on Portal Network, state expiry, 4444, etc.",
