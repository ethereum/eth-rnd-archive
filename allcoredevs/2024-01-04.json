I'd like to slowly start commiting to which changes do we expect  on the CL side for the small fork. This is mostly for the CL teams: but I kinda suspect that Max EB is not doable on a small fork so it smells to me that either Max EB is the only change we work on to ship in a 12-18 month schedule with Verkle, or it gets pushed to at the very least 2 forks from now. Would like to hear from others what they think from the invasiveness of Max EB. I did look in detail because I'm anyway implementing it for Prysm for an ePBS project, and it's fairly invasive all across the code.",
