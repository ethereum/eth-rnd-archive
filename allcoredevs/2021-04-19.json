And Besu?) configs are more complex, and each fork is defined by carefully combining features. This was in the case of parity a deliberate choice to support various forks/blockchains, not just eth mainnet and testnets. \n\nThis high complexity led to a corner-case where a precompile was defined but inactive, combined with a flaw in obtaining the \"list of precompiles\" for 2929 which didn't check if it was active. In any \"berlin\" statetest, the precompile was undefined.",
