Nimbus does this for example -- all the internal processing where performance matters for the state transition function (and adjacent code as much as feasible) is on specific types, say, a Deneb or Electra state or block. It does not have to keep checking if it's the correct type of block, or risk the theoretical possibility of having the wrong variant (\"profile\" here) of state or block",
