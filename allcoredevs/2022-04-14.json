I just wanted to say, you do a great job! By not rushing, ignoring the pressure to ensure a merge to PoS without major problems you do the right choice. I wish I personally could be more active and involved, but I don’t have the capacity at the moment. This world is full of \"experts\" who talk and doing nothing, you people make stuff happen, and that’s what counts. Keep up the good work! 🙏🏻",
