It took me around two months to be close in pairs with Besu and evmone. It still needs integration with Reth, but that is a smaller task. So I would say that the effort of adding EOF is around three to three and a half months for one person (depending on the client). Work outside of EVM is in adding the first EOF contract and a new transaction type. \n\nInstructions were straightforward to add, and they did not clash with legacy opcodes. EOF verification was a different thing, and I depended more on code than spec, but it has good tests. Instruction testing is still missing but it is currently worked on.",
