The WGEIP repo is entirely the Developers' responsibility to govern, and is where documents move through the development workflow.  The EIPs repo is where the Editors do their work and publish what the Devs want to publish there, especially Final EIPs.  I think with a scheme like this we can meet the needs and objections of the developers and editors.",

The tentative spec can be found here: https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/dencun-devnet-8 \n- Three PRs to consider for inclusion in devnet-8 (to be discussed on 4844 call Monday, and final go/no-go before ACDC next week): https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3454, https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/339, https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/426\n- We discussed edge cases around 6780 (SELFDESTRUCT removal), see: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7308 - the first and third bullet in the PR were uncontroversial, but the second (\"If a contract is not destroyed, any SELFDESTRUCT to self burning will not occur.\") seems to affect users  (see: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4758-deactivate-selfdestruct/8710/38?u=timbeiko). We'll follow up on this. Flagging to \u003c@\u0026923742355746619402\u003e \u003c@\u0026975126492117864479\u003e \u003c@\u0026975127821045342240\u003e \u003c@\u0026975128102894190672\u003e and others! \n- We agreed to merge the following two execution APIs PR: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/438 \u0026 https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/430. \n- We also discussed https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/297 but didn't reach consensus \n- We then discussed the EIP/ERCs split, which now has a formal specification: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7329 - client teams seemed to agree to move forward with this, but Greg had an alternative proposal (see above). \n- Lastly, quick shout to the naming conversation for the next fork! https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/name-needed-for-combined-el-cl-prague-electra-upgrade/15122",
