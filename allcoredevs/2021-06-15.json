I'll copy some of what I wrote down here: https://github.com/ethereum-cdap/cohort-zero/issues/59\n\n\u003e Do you have something that \"needs to be figured out\"? Or maybe an interesting idea that you just don't have time to execute on? Maybe an upcoming EIP that needs a proof-of-concept implementation? A valuable data-set that needs to be extracted from the chain data? Some analysis of deployed smart contract bytecode?\n\nIf you've got something that fits into this description, you might consider opening it as an issue in the `cohort-zero` repository.",
