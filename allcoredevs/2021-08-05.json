Checking back a week later and still slightly disappointed with the way things are being handled. Not an ETH dev but a dev for the extended ecosystem. I know I don't have a say in any of this but just felt the need to get it out of my system.\n\nMy understanding is that some stakeholders have/had reservations about London code being ready for mainnet but devs are unwilling to push back deployment because their hands are tied due to having written themselves into a corner with the difficulty bomb. I understand that the merits of keeping the difficulty bomb is a separate discussion altogether but if it was meant to force migration to 2.0, it shouldn't even be an issue for a non-merge related fork in the first place. 3554 (as 3238 back then) should have been pushed out in June regardless of 1559's delays. It shouldn't have been used to force action for non-merge updates. Postponing it by 2 years in 2019 was a step in the right direction and to be back at square one today is a tad bit disappointing.",

A LOT rests on the stability of the mainnet. London is not just random small bug fixes but a complete rework of core functionality. With how much 1559 was delayed and with POS supposedly to hit in 4 months, is there really a need to rework the fee structure and potentially break things?\n\nIn the real world, where the directors have to answer to the investors, if something like this was discovered so close to launch the launch date would have been put on hold indefinitely and everyone would be put on double overtime to make sure there wasn't other issues. But this being an open source project, where corporate governance is non-existent, means that you can't just have people put in more effort or be accountable for any resulting errors.",

How much of decision to push forward on the same release date was motivated by the fear of causing an uncontrolled price crash? How many people are pushing it so hard because they want prices back at 4k and do not care about sustainability of the ecosystem? Now that prices are more or less back to stable territory ~2.7k, it should have given room to push back the date for proper testing. A temporary price setback would be better than the fallout from breaking everything.\n\nIf you guys were worried about the backlash, an announcement calling for feedback from the community that actually uses the ecosystem with full disclosure about hiccups would have been the right way to handle it. Not have repeated meetings among the same handful of core devs that have the same bias on the issue. ETH is already being criticised for being too centralised with governance. Eventually this will be more of a negative than a positive.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

With how much 1559 has been delayed, the window between London and 2.0 is so tiny that it might no longer be worth the risk of messing with the fee structure. Reminder that nobody even knows if 1559 will lower transaction fees at all or just result in a complete standstill in transactions because it's all theories mixed with hope.

Firstly, people thought that EIP-1559 would decrease the gas fees, but it was clear for developers that it WOULDN'T, but people including Tim were remaining silent until EIP-1559 became a very heated topic.\n\nLast year it is clearly seen that ETH people are doing everything just to pump the price.
