        "content": "**ACDE 189 Recap**\n- After a lot of back and forth, we finalized the Pectra scope 🎉 ! EOF and EIP-7702 are both included (PR: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8627). To give teams time to work on their EOF implementations and do cross-client testing on everything else in the fork, devnet-1 will **not** include EOF, but will include all other Pectra EIPs. Notably, we'll include 7702 even though the spec may still be changed. \n- We're tentatively planning to include the following changes in devnet-1, but will leave a few more days for people to review them prior to merging the PRs: \n    - https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8625\n    - https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/554\n    - https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/549\n    - https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/545 (already merged)\n- We discussed deactivating EIP-158, as it would cause issues similar to SELFDESTRUCT in a post-Verkle world and EIP-7702 as currently specified could create accounts with 0 nonce/balance/codehash but storage. \u003c@353136597522448385\u003e will draft a proposal to formally consider the change. If 7702 is tweaked in a way that does not cause this issue, we'd consider it for the Verkle fork. \n- \u003c@364458974906548225\u003e came on to get a status update on EIP-4444 \u0026 portal support by client teams. A few client teams have begun working on this, but flagged that they currently have many competing priorities. The Portal team will keep monitoring \u003c#953349957400821860\u003e to offer help to any client team needing it!\n- We briefly discussed my proposed ACD/Network Upgrade Process/EthMag change doc (https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-network-upgrade-ethmagicians-process-improvements/20157) and agreed to try the \"EIP Review Request\" proposal. There weren't any objections to PFI/CFI/SFI, but given the scope I'll open a PR for us to discuss before agreeing to the change. \n- Testing teams proposed a new channel layout for discord (see above)",
