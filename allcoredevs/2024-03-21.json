The separate calls made sense when the beacon chain was securing nothing. The whole idea that there are two separate layers is fuzzy at best. We can easily have a joint biweekly call and be more productive on Thursdays",

I feel there's still some value in having a \"default\" theme for each call (e.g. keeping EVM discussions in ACDE by default and PoS issuance discussions in ACDC), but if we only had a single call every two weeks we could be looser with time-sensitive stuff being discussed on both sides. \n\nAnother argument in favour is we could then also schedule high-value breakouts/testing/etc. calls on the \"off week\" Thursdays as needed, and limit the number of them on other days 😄",
