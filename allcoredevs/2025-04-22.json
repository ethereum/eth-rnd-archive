It combines data from multiple client implementations, only attesting to the latest state of the chain when there is consensus across them. This can help protect validators from ending up stuck on the wrong chain. Vero can protect validators from client bugs both on the CL and EL side.\n\nhttps://serenita.io/blog/2025/vero-v1\n\nIf you're interested in how it compares to Vouch/DVT read the following docs page: https://github.com/serenita-org/vero/blob/master/docs/why_vero.md",
