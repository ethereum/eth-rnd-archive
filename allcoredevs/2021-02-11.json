        "content": "Re: Berlin fork blocks, what do people think about having a staged deployment for testnets? \n\nWhen all clients are synced to YOLOv3, we choose a fork block for Testnet 1 ~3 weeks out, Testnet 2 ~4 weeks out, Testnet 3 ~5 weeks out, and mainnet 7-8 weeks out. This way, if Berlin breaks one testnet, we can ship an update that disables it before it goes live on all the other networks. We can also choose the order based on usage so that testnets with the highest traffic get forked first and have the most time pre-mainnet. \n\nHaving this also means we can choose the mainnet block early, and only need people to update once if nothing goes wrong. \n\nI'd propose going Goerli -\u003e Ropsten -\u003e Rinkeby, but it's not a strong preference. Re: Kovan, OE can do whatever they feel is best 👍",

That way we have more confidence that the mainnet fork will happen and will be less likely to \"retract\" the mainnet block which might lead to confusion.  Basically release N has the testnet blocks defined, release N+1 includes the mainnet fork block but is released sometime between testnet 1 and testnet 3 forking (where N is different for each client obviously).",
