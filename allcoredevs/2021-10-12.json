What exactly it's being exercised by just making small changes and forcing people to update. Same for the merge, it seems that for anyone that wants to maintain a pow fork of Ethereum and disable the bomb it would require almost no infrastructure: just delay it for years and keep the current clients as they are now with minimal maintenance. The only objective impact that I can see of the bomb is that it forces ACD to agree on something regularly. This in itself seems to be a non trivial task and perhaps it's already enough to make it worth maintaining it",

Perhaps an analogous software development example is something like FizzBuzz: an easy interview question which helps weed out candidates who can't program simple logic. Hopefully, having this bomb adds enough of a barrier that any fork at least has a minimal amount of technical + coordination capabilities, reducing the risk of constant \"scam forks\". \n\nFor Ethereum itself, it does act as a medium-strength forcing function to upgrade the network 😅",
