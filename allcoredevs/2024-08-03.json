Obviously, some people will have thoughts and opinions about specific ACD topics. But the right place to voice them is either this Discord (in the channel for the topic) or the next ACD. It's a public call!\n\nI fear creating another meta-layer of discussion about ACDs will introduce an ambiguity about where comments should be posted. And who will volunteer long-term to monitor those threads and answer questions of people who weren't in that ACD?",
