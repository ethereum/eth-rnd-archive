Summary from today's call:\n \n- Client teams made various bug fixes found on peerdas-devnet-4.\n- Some teams started working on validator custody. Design documents were shared.\n- PeerDAS devnet-4 is still running, but new nodes have issues syncing due to an EL version change. We'll pin to a working geth version since the issue is not PeerDAS related.\n- Teams discussed the proposal to move proof computation to the transaction sender. Next step is to draft a PR to the PeerDAS EIP and discuss with ACD.\n\nFull notes below, recording will be available later\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ng2IrCe28kTt1BnIsjtMlKHq2MHgaja24LhFXSvqfJQ/edit?usp=sharing",
