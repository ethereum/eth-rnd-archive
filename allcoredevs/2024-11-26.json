It seems that increasing the target and not the limit will be actually a non-trivial change in our codebase though. So if we do go with an increase, I want to leave the suggestion that we go with an increase to 4/8 rather than 4/6. It solves the pricing issue, the code complexity around having these changes and changing our Merklke proof of inclusion, etc.. and is more likely to land in time for the fork. We can do another run of tests on scenarios closer to mainnet later on, but I think at least in what long-range tests we are seing, the increase in the target/limit is doable.",
