The precompile should be big-endian, and if a client uses little-endian crypto lib it will do a conversion. My thought was to avoid changing the library used by the CL pyspec by using a wrapper on a low level of the spec",

        "content": "Hi there, I am from the EthStorage team. We are currently working on building a storage layer 2 based on the 4844 testnet. The whole process is to send data blob tx and retrieve the corresponding EL block number through an emitted event, and then download the blob using the CL API, which is similar to http://cl-server/eth/v1/beacon/blocks/slotNumber. Unfortunately, we are unsure how to obtain the slot number by the EL block number. Is there a recommended method to achieve this? We believe this is a common question for all layer 2 implementations.",
