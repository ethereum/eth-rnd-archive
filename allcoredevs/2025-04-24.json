I am not convinced there is a good candidate, but it is worth exploring imo.",

We'll make a decision on Monday about any potential scope adjustments for EOF then. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, please make sure to watch the recording of today's ACD. \n\n2. **SFI'ing the Gas Limit Defaults Informational EIP**\n\nOn the last ACDE, we agreed to make increasing the gas limit one of the key \"features\" of Fusaka. To align on client defaults and keep this as a priority, we've drafted an EIP. It's a bit unconventional, but not unprecedented (see EIP-7840). We plan to get it merged it in the next and formally SFI it on the next ACD. PR: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9678\n\nAs we find bottlenecks to actually raise the gas limit, we should expect minor EIPs to patch them, such as https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9658\n\n3. **History Expiry Next Steps**\n\nIt seems unclear exactly what the status of the different teams' support is w.r.t. dropping history in May. Let's use \u003c#953349957400821860\u003e to coordinate next steps.",
