I have put here what I think are actual bottlenecs \nmy TL;DR is that actually storage is not that much of a bottleneck because as \u003c@219015859182632960\u003e   says, soon stakers will  be advised to use 4 TB of space anyway - but in reality the issue seems to be the worst case with bandwidth \nif you were to say - double gas limit - you would have 3.4 MB as the worst case block size, which is probably not the end of the world anyway - but it is an impressive number nonetheless. Said that - EIP7783 would offset the risks of something like that being an issue and the calldata repricing would nullify the bandwidth's worst case",
