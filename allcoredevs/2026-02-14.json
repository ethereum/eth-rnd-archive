    "content": "Unfortunately,  we are still years away from vetting a proper quantum-resistant algorithm for all parts of the stack that are also scalable (ECDSA signatures for tx signing,  KZG commitments,  BLS 12-381 signatures for consensus). Framed Transactions (as I understand them) are merely an intermediate step to prepare Ethereum for a future transition to new quantum resistant algorithms. Certainly important,  but not time sensitive and with minimal direct user benefits on its own.",
