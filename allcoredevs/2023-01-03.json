First, we've decided to harmonize EL and CL call naming because it was a bit of a misnomer that the EL call was called \"AllCoreDevs\" but we had half the client teams on the CL side. So, we now have ACDE/ACDC (and CL folks get the coolest name ⚡ !) \n\nAlso, we're moving the calls from the @EthereumFoundation Youtube channel to @EthereumProtocol, which was the OG Ethereum YT channel. \n\nI'll update the README in ethereum/pm to reflect all this sometime this week 🙂",
