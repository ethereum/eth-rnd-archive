Mainnet Shadow Fork scheduled for Monday \n- As discussed here before, we agreed to move forward with the Engine API \u0026 EL using `gwei` to represent values\n- That said, we **won't** use SSZ to encode the root on the EL. We'll keep RLP for now, and if/when we move to SSZ, it will be for a larger number of fields. \n- We agreed to add 6049 (SELFDESTRUCT deprecation notice) to Shanghai \"symbolically\" to give the community a heads up. Given 6049 says SD may be removed or altered in functionality, people felt like it captured the right intention even if we went with something like 6190 in the future. \n- We agreed to CFI the EOF EIPs that we removed from Shanghai for Cancun \n- We agreed to give the Network Upgrade Meta Threads a try for Cancun \n- And, a few announcements: \n    - Community call tomorrow (https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/708)\n    - EthCatHerders client diversity survey (https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/client-diversity-on-ethereum-network-3854b5c3c95f)\n    - KZG ceremony is live at ceremony.ethereum.org \n    - No ACDC next week, ACDE back on the week after",
