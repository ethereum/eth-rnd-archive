There was an issue with a preconf protocol we support in mainnet that requires submissions to go through the protocol's mev boost relay. They had an issue with the demotion logic which is why there were multiple missed slots. We have some alerting to track this, but in this case given they were relatively rare (22 / 8369 blocks built by Titan over the period) so they did not trigger. We're adding better monitoring for this and to detect potential issues with a given relay",
