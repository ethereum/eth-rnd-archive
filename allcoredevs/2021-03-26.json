At the end of the day, the goal of Ethereum is to bring developers together, so we should always prefer simplicity over other advantages.\n\nI'd vote for REST just to make it very clear this is a separate interaction than the legacy eth1 API, but would personally be fine with a _truly_ stateless JSONRPC API as well.  I think building statefulness into the _transport_ used for eth1\u003c-\u003eeth2 communication is overly limiting at this point in time.  It's _much_ easier to go from a stateless API to a stateful one if statefulness is ultimately required, it's very hard to go the other way.\n\nLikewise I'd vote for any required signing etc to be built into the protocol itself rather than for example requiring HTTPS for the REST endpoint.",
