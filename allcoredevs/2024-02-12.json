If we agree to this, it would become our third \"retroactively applied from genesis\" EIP, along with 2681 and 3607. At n=3, it starts to feel like we should have more than a sub-table in the README of the spec 😅  https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/?tab=readme-ov-file#ethereum-protocol-releases\n\nCurious how people think we could keep track of these, and if we should have a (soft?) rule of editing things like the Yellow Paper when we agree to such changes. Could potentially make it a \"Living\" Meta EIP?",
