As Marius said the current bloom probably has way too many false positives so in many ways it's probably preferable to leave indexing of the logs up to the client teams.\n\nAlso is there any way we can figure out how to make this somehow \"retroactive\"?  Like what if we computed roots w/o the blooms in the receipts and a block header and stored/verified that in some aux struct that was gossiped and used as an alternate means to verify the blocks?  Or is that overkill if history-expiry is already in the pipe?",
