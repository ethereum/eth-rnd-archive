        "content": "I think I'm coming around to Option 1 since max blob count/gas is more or less analogous to the block gasLimit, which is equally as wasteful, but at least would have some parity. This would also be a small modification to 7742.\n\nOption 2 is my next preference if we can get around the syncing issues, but I am fine with Option 3 as a short term solution for Pectra.\n\nHearing the L2 feedback, I don't think eth_feeHistory should be a blocker for 7742 and we should instead remove blobGasUsedRatio. I double checked with Linea team and they don't intend to use the ratio in the future.\nMaybe we should remove blobGasUsedRatio regardless so ppl don't start using it?\n\nAs for the txpool issues...e.g. Besu does use max blob count to inform some cache sizes but at some point those caches are going to need to support e.g. 128 blobs so we could just do that work now (or incrementally support max 9 in the short term).\n\nAll that said, I don't feel strongly that 7742 is important for Pectra and it's easy to revisit next fork.",
