I'm mainly collating sources right now, but I'll do my best: \n\nTLDR\nthis paper discusses an optimized algorithm that does fast BLS12-381 mapping in a simpler way for approximately the same work. So in short, decrease code complexity and maintain performance.\n\nI'm curious if anyone has heard of this before, and if it's a good method to look deeper into",
