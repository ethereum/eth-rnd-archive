In practive there are several other criteria to fullfill, and even some of NIST curves are not perfect (as P224 considering twist security but no one uses this one).\nWhile DSM allows infinite number of curves, in practice contracts will only use a few among well established ones https://neuromancer.sk/std/network (and some dozens more at most). It could also be coded as an acceptable mapping, quickly updatable (one entry in a table of (p,a,b) triples).\nWhen you use an EoA, it is the responsability of the wallet to provide enough entropy, ecrecover doesn't assess that a low weight secret isn't use for instance, or that RNG is not trapped. It is accepted as an external requirement. Flawed curve is the same as flawed EoA. But it is far more easier to trap a signer than a curve\n(using custom non standard curve means you also have some custom proprietary signer).",
