Assuming we fork testnets in ~mid Feb, there would likely be ~1 month between that and the mainnet fork, but it's unlikely to be 1 month from the last testnet forking to mainnet (maybe 2-3 weeks?), which is when we'd probably set the epoch.",

Update the epoch in the code linked above, get the PR merged and the new Polkadot runtime released.\n2. Create a referendum for the Polkadot community to vote on the upgrade, e.g. https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/1202?tab=description\n3. The community votes on the referendum, can take 2-3 weeks. On successful voting, the upgrade executes.\n\nI realize this might be a unique request and that most of the community might want an earlier upgrade, but I'd ask at least 3 weeks notice if at all possible. 🙂",
