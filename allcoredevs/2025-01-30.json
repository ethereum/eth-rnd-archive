This can be easily disabled for Holesky since it is configurable, but we expect to have a fix for it very soon. Therefore, this should not be considered a blocker for devnet-6 or Holesky.\n\nRegarding fork scheduling, it would be ideal to launch devnet-6 as soon as possible. Once it remains stable for a few days, we can proceed with scheduling Holesky. However, we will also be ready if we decide to release it on Monday for holesky.\n\nUpdate: It is 100% fixed 🙂",
