With the natural performance upgrade of minimum hardware specs + QUIC p2p(http3), this is doable. Maybe preliminary consensus can be achieved in a few seconds with a selected subset validators, but finality can still wait much longer. dApps can choose how many blocks they want to wait to approve tx based on tx amount or other criteria",
