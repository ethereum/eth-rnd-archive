We're leaving Baikal up until at least the testnet forks so that people can use it to interact with 1559 and other London EIPs. It would be great to send transactions on it which test the various EIPs, and also which raise/lower the base fee on the network, \u003c@!574864862338088960\u003e had built a tool to spam a network with transaction, which should work here: https://github.com/ConsenSys/tommygun-eth \n\n2. We agreed to use EIP-3554 rather than 3238 for the difficulty bomb pushback and to re-run the numbers ~two months from now to make sure we are still on track. I will follow up on that right after the July fork. \n\n3. For the JSON RPC naming, we agreed to go with the terms from the spec, namely `baseFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, \u0026  `maxFeePerGas`\n\n4. For London timing, we agreed to keep the July 14th mainnet date as a target, but there was some concern that the schedule is tight. We don't want to commit to the block number on mainnet until the first testnet forks successfully, but for testnets, we'll use the following block numbers:  Ropsten: `10399301` (June 9, 2021), Goerli:  `4979794` (June 16, 2021), Rinkeby: `8813188` (June 23, 2021). I've added them to the London spec.",
