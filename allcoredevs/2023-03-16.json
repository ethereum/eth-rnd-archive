Some things that came up:\n    - SSZ: Teams hesitant to do a wholesale transition during Cancun, but we still need to figure out (1) how to make the 4844 txn type forward compatible, (2) what breaks on-chain when we move the transactions to SSZ encoding and (3) if we want to do more than the 4844 txn type for Cancun (i.e. update the withdrawal root). We can discuss in \u003c#779922457631916064\u003e and will share updates on the next ACDE\n    - SELFDESTRUCT removal: teams would like to see it in Cancun, but we need a spec that deals with the edge cases. Can use \u003c#688075293562503241\u003e to discuss. \n    - EVMMAX: Now have two proposals, one with and one without EOF. \n    - EOF: no major updates on the call, conversations continuing in \u003c#706868829900505180\u003e and breakout rooms\n    - BLS: important to help liquid staking pools, should be considered independently of EVMMAX\n    - EIP-1153: tests merged in ethereum/tests, some client devs supportive for Cancun\n    - EIP-4788: simple addition that also makes things better for liquid staking pools\n    - EIP-663: updated to be EOF-compatible, should be part of EOFv1\n    - EIP-5920: skepticism about the value add of this\n\nOver the next few weeks, client teams should think through priorities for the fork. Also, if you have a candidate Cancun EIP, now is the time to make it known 😄 \n\nAnd, lastly, Pooja went over the EthCatHerders node operator survey that just came out: https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/exploring-ethereums-client-ecosystem-afc9affa84dd",
