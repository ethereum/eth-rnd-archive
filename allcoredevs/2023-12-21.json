We'll first be forking Goerli on Jan 17th (epoch `231680`), then, assuming it goes well, we'll fork Sepolia on Jan 30th (epoch `132608`) and Holesky on Feb 7th (epoch `29696`). ** Spec PRs for these changes are linked in earlier messages. \n- **Client teams, plan to have a first release out with the Goerli fork configs by Jan 8th**, as we'll announce the upgrade on the 9th. Then, assuming Goerli goes smoothly, we'll only have a single client release for both the Sepolia and Holesky forks, allowing us to move a bit quicker, again, assuming no issues. \n- We discussed having a reserved precompile range for L2-specific precompiles. After some back and forth, we landed on reserving 0x512-1024 for L2s. We'll draft an EIP making this explicit. TBD whether an L2 precompile that gets added to L1 would maintain the same address or not. \n- Lastly, we briefly discussed Prague/Electra. On the EL side, the biggest question is whether we want to do a fork with several smaller EIPs before doing Verkle. Client teams should review the list of proposals here: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/prague-electra-network-upgrade-meta-thread/16809 --- we'll discuss things in more detail in the new year, and also schedule a Verkle deep dive during one of the first 2024 ACDEs\n\nReminder that there is no ACD next week (but people are free to use a voice channel here on Thurs 14 UTC if they want an informal catch up), and on Jan 4th we'll have \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e running ACDE. \n\nHappy holidays everyone 🎄",
