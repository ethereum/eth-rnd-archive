I don't see *any* appends so potentially its not implemented for lighthouse even to opt in...\nLodestar also is basically only populating if graffiti is empty.\nEL data looks relatively stable and representative, but CL data is heavily skewed and should be taken with a grain of salt (its pretty accepted LH is over 33% and teku is around 10-15%).",
