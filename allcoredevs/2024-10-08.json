I understand the naive statement that disks become larger but so does the db and therefore there are two forces one that increases the value of opcodes over time while the other decreases it. However believing that this would stay constant is naive. I agree with you that if this ratio has gotten worse over time we should decrease the gas limit, but since the last 4 years benches on my db have actually improved while my disk has doubled so at least my node is saying what we are better than 4 years ago in this regard",

However, receipts can be regenerated if we have blocks, so there's no risk of losing them if the blocks are available. This approach could allow us to reduce disk space without waiting for Portal Network integration across all clients. Additionally, it will help the community get used to the idea of removing historical data from nodes.",
