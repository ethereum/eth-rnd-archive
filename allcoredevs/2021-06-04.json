There are two parts to this: one being what the `BASEFEE` opcode. the other is that it affects the gasPrice. So previsouly, `geth` used a `0` gasPrice for evaluating a call, and the address `0x000...` as the sender. But since price was `0`, it doesn't matter if the balance is zero. If we use a non-zero value for gasprice, we somehow need the 'sender' account to have a balance.",
