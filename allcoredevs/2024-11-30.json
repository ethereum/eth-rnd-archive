As proposed in the call it might make most sense to ship the blob target/max increase separate from everything touching the base fee mechanism and just manually update the blob base fee update fraction (like Ansgar did in [this PR](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9060)).\n\nAlso as said on ACD, I put 7623 on the agenda of the next ACDE next week. Hope we find consensus to ship it, as it's important for de-risking the blob throughput increase and, very generally, limit worst case bandwidth limits.",
