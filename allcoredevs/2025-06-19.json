Is there any contract that actually requires this (I can only think RSA verification and is not even worth supporting most likely)? \n\nMy assumption was that 32bytes will do for almost any case (most EC stuff that is non-native for example).\n\nThus, removing the issue of MODEXP completely with much more bounded inputs and much bounded gas_estimation costs.",

Right now, SSV accounts for \u003e10% of the validator set.  While the gas limit is configurable at the SSV client, I would guess that the majority of SSV users are not aware of this.  And setting the gas limit is not configurable at the user level, only at the operator level. Which has some additional complexity because of the threshold signing that is needed per SSV cluster. It might be worth factoring this into your discussions on the topic.  A special kind of centralization risk related to DVT...",
