        "content": "The problem with option 2 is that CL should communicate that value for each payload. This isn't what each CL client does today. During sync some CLs are running block_hash validation by themselves and call `newPayload`  infrequently to guide EL's sync. So, with option 2 it's not guaranteed that each block will have the max value stored alongside to it, and when the gap is around fork boundary it becomes tricky to decide which max value to use for RPC calls",
