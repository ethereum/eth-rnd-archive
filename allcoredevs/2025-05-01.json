        "content": "RE: Alexey's point on the strategy for the runtime...here's my strawman roadmap.\n\nThe first and least disruptive goal imo is improving performance by recalibrating the gas schedule (Ben A \u0026 others have been doing awesome work on the opcode repricing wg). Main things for me are: \n1. make existing compute really cheap + introduce new compute opcodes for really common math in DeFi (sqrt, log2, count leading zeros etc)\n2. Making new storage allocation much more expensive (like 10-25x potentially) to protect against excessive state growth, make same block warm storage access and writes similar to TLOAD/TSTORE, given every client has read and write-through periodically flushed mem caches. \n\nThe bottleneck in our numbers is not the interpreter, it's generally host-related things (precompiles, db) so things that improve the VM itself perf wise are nice but not high ROI.\n\nThe second one IMO is further improvements to the developer experience, where there's a clutch change on memory pricing which addresses both Solidity being unable to implement spilling cheaply, and Vyper's ability to do dynamic types.\n\nBeyond that I think there is probably another surgical change in the AA neighborhood which would allow users to submit txs that don't pay ETH in the txpool, but are only valid if paired with an ETH paying tx, kinda like a native bundle type. (I understand the AA team's concerns on censorship etc I think we don't need to worry about these in the txpool as they'll be addressed by FOCIL)\n\nI don't think EVMMAX/EVM SIMD make sense or are good ideas as the cryptography toolkit you need to do serious ZKPs is mostly there already, and again isn't the bottleneck in systems I see given they all end up verifying an EC SNARK which is well supported. I could see the case eg for a poseidon precompile, but that's a smol thing.",

So to me it's just lower in the priority list, esp given most noobie devs write pretty well tested contracts these days with coverage, fuzzing and soon a linter etc we give via Foundry.\n\nRE the FV argument, I would love it to be true, my understanding is that people gotta learn to write good properties, and that's what gets you results in fuzzing / FV. So I'm not sure the VM would 10x things there if devs don't learn how to write good properties",

When I studied Solana, I noticed that it too performed multiple repricing of the operations, but for Solana it was much easier than for EVM, guess why? Because the gas (it is called \"compute units\" but is essentially gas) is unobservable for the smart contracts from the beginning. Gas un-observability makes repricing almost trivial. For your excitement to Risk-V, as I already pointed out, but it is again does not seem to be understood. EOF is \"Object Format\". So the main feature is not changes in EVM, but in organising the code structure. Which can also be very helpful when doing RISCV. And essential when you want to make backwards compatible transition. When I looked at EOF in a lot of details couple of months ago (thanks to \u003c@425274498732916736\u003e for taking time to explain), it did not see anything there which could be explained by \"drive to perfectionism\".  Things are as simple as possible, but not simpler. It went even further, by offering a whole \"menu\" of options with different set of features. When EOF was acceped on ACD a month or so ago, I thought it would not, because the strategy containing it was obviously absent. So it was not surprising for me to see it being excluded, because without strategy, it did not have a chance IMO. I am not trying to get it re-included, I just wish for the implications for what is being done to be understood.",

I believe if someone does not know how to live without gas or code introspection, they will be able to learn in a few months. The vast majority of software in the world does not require these features, and it still works 🙂",
