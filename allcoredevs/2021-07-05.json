        "content": "Sorry to jump back to earlier conversation. Here's my (wallet person) perspective on block number for hf:\n\nNo wallet or user facing thing has a (valid) excuse for not being ready in July as July has always been the general understanding on when the hf would occur. Most expect things to be a bit slower in reality bc that's how dev things work but, again, core devs being on time not a valid excuse for others lollll.\n\nImo clients and network security and fuzzing and all that stuff is most important. If they sign off, that's step 1 and probably the only step that's an absolute requirement. \n\nThat said, there are some obvious user facing players where the readiness does have a bigger impact than others. Namely: where the changes being not implemented in time could adversely affect the ecosystem as a whole in a way that would be best for core devs to try to avoid (or at least not blatantly ignore). In this case I would say Etherscan, MetaMask are probably the key ones. Imtoken too as they have vast amt of users in the east. Miners could be considered mostly to at least show some consideration for them where it's easy to do so since there are so many changes occuring that...erhm...don't/can't consider them 😅\n\nLastly, asking \"what date do you want\" is a v different question than \"If any of you has a reason why this date is not viable, speak now or forever hold your peace.\" I would recommend the latter if asking various players bc the former will not get any form of social consensus. 😉\n\nOh and fyi ethcc is July 20-22nd, which only matters if a large amt of key players who need to be on their A game in case things go wrong are attending. I doubt this is the case but....you know.",

Strongly agree with the \"If any of you has a reason why this date is not viable, speak now or forever hold your peace.\" approach 🙂 \n\nI think these types of announcement do take some time to \"ripple\" through the ecosystem, and while a lot of the largest players pay close attention (e.g. Etherscan, Infura, MetaMask and others have all been active in this channel in the last week), it's good to give notice for people to upgrade. Historically, we've tried to do at least 3 weeks, and IMO unless there is an emergency, we don't gain much by speeding things up beyond that and everyone feeling even more rushed than they already are.",

Bc were all selfish lol.\n\nI would suspect that if the hf were to be decided to be like tomorrow or something, and a product didnt have time to implenent support for some time after, and ecosystem as a whole would be questioning why. The natural answer is of course \"it's the products fault\" but, for certain products, very close on it's heels would be \"why didn't the core devs take that into consideration when choosing a date.\"\n\nThe only wrong answer is \"we didn't consider it.\" The right answer is \"*we discussed it* and agreed [insert literally anything here].\"",

The argument \"if X doesnt implement users will use something else\" if and only if something else exists. Which means if one of those products were to not implenent there would be a lot of angry people with nothing better to do that blame ALL the people. You can call it a PR move on core devs behalf but it's actually not that. It's avoiding a massive distraction and demoralizing event for those who have have better things to do, should be celebrating the work that went into he fork, and would generally prefer to avoid all \"politics.\" 😉",
