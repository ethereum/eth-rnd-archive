        "content": "Somewhat of a random question, not necesarilly ACD material, but figured I'd like a feedback either way. In Geth, we'd like to add a startup banner with the chain configuration (enabled forks) so it becomes a bit easier to see what's set up and how (especially as the merge comes along). To do that, we wanted to add a link to hard fork specs so anyone looking at the logs can actually click on something right then and there to see what \"spurious dragon\" even means.\n\nCurrently I've added the github URL of the fork specs, but they are immensely long (e.g. `https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/tangerine-whistle.md`), which is uselessly long really. Was wondering if anyone would have an objection to get a shortened set of URLs from the ethereum.org domain forwarding to wherever the current spec resides.\n\nE.g. `ethereum.org/forks/tangerine-whistle` -\u003e point-to-that-ugly-url-above\n\nI personally would prefer `forks.ethereum.org/tangerine-whistle`, but the website team said that that's complicated as that requires a new project to manage the subdomain, vs adding it to the actual website as a redirect is simple. I can live with both really as long as either works.\n\nWhilst I know most people here won't have a say in how the website is structured, I think such a feature could be useful for other clients too, so maybe you could share if you think this is a good or bad idea before I ask anyone to go ahead with it?
