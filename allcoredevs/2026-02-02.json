    "content": "Just a quick heads-up: I moved the trustless log index breakout session #2 one hour later (tomorrow 15:00 UTC) in order to resolve the collision with the FCR breakout.\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1911\nI hope this session will be more productive, last time I just came up with some new ideas a few days before the call so I wasn't really prepared to transmit them in a digestable form, sorry about that.\nSince then I polished the new proposal and simplified it even further. Also made a nice presentation with practical examples and informative drawings, I hope this will help to make progress (I also linked the updated proposal draft in the issue but I also want to present some slides with more details). I am quite confident now that it is both a really good path forward and much easier to understand.",
