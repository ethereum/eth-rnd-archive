I think that's probably the minimum safe amount to ensure that folks update their nodes. \n\nI don't have a strong opinion re: how long the testnets should each stay up, but it is worth noting that if the block times drift, something like 1-2 days may be insufficient to have the forks. \n\nI think the things we want to solve for here are:\n\n1. Having at least a 2 week release cycle and small buffer from the day the testnet blocks are agreed upon and the first fork (so that clients can package, communicate and distribute their release);\n2. Not having all 3 testnets fork at once so that if something goes wrong on one, we can issue a patch release before the others fork;\n3. Having N weeks of testnet usage before mainnet. I think historically N has been between 4-6. \n\nOpen to suggestions about how to best achieve this 👍 It _seems_ like we'll be all good on YOLOv3 by next ACD, so it would be nice to have a soft consensus on the way forward before then so we can use the call to rubber stamp it vs. debate the multiple options 😄",
