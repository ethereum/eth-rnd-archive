Bumping the contract size limit needs further investigation though imo.",

The goal is to figure out the impact of increasing code size.\n\nThen we can test like https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/d618e5259a06179d7556af1961166cb7bc5da1e6/tests/benchmark/compute/instruction/test_account_query.py#L123 (EXTCODEx on unique contracts) on the 24 / 32 kib contracts to see the impact for EXTCODEx and\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/d618e5259a06179d7556af1961166cb7bc5da1e6/tests/benchmark/compute/instruction/test_system.py#L53 xCALLx opcodes doing the same\nNOTE: target contract is a random code contract which starts with a STOP. We can (should (?)) expand this by also putting JUMPDEST analysis here. I am not sure if clients cache these jumpdests, but we can change the contract factory such that it deploys (unique) jumpdest contracts. The contract will JUMP to the end of the code (which has a valid jumpdest) so we force clients to either lookup or perform the JUMPDEST analysis",

Here are the results: https://hackmd.io/V-rZ9Wg0To6FpnjWIQWsmA (there's a bunch of graphs, still need to write down all the explanations but wanted to collect the results in bloatnet first).\n\nSo I'd suggest to not duplicate work. I will take this branch from Marius and extend the benchmark for sizes up to 256kB (if \u003c@360491619402776577\u003e you can enable it in Geth which I assume is the case already in the PR).",
