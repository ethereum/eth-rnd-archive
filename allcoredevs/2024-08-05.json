        "content": "Thanks for the feedback everyone 🙏 ! I agree that EthMagicians and `ethereum/pm` are better in terms of archiving, sharing, etc. so will bias towards that vs. more ephemeral places like Discord/Twitter. \n\nRe: \"too much conversation on ACD recaps\", my sense is our main problem is closer to the opposite of that: people outside ACD don't feel super informed about what's going on and it's hard for someone who cares about only a single topic to know \"where to follow things\". If we saw too much spam on things, I'd be happy to consider restricting write access, but it feels premature to solve for that now. \n\nRe: GH vs. EthMagicians, Github is obviously \"closer to the work\", but one challenge is that the non-code artifacts, like Issues/PRs are platform dependent. For example, if the @ethereum Github org got deleted tomorrow, we'd lose all past ACD agendas. I'm sure we could get the notes/transcripts/code from people's local git copies, but Issues/PRs are much harder. OTOH,  moving the agendas to EthMag feels \"noisier\", at least right now 😅 \n\nBased on all this, I think I'll keep recaps on EthMag for now and see how it goes!",
