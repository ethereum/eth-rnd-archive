In fact, we are currently implementing experimental support in the Solidity compiler, which we hope to have completed by the end of the year. We're convinced that this is the right direction for the EVM.\nActually, one thing that is not necessarily a part of EOF itself, but does depend on it, which we'd also very much like to see is EIP-663 - that should be a miniscule change for the clients with no downsides that I'd be aware of, and it would help us a lot, so ideally, we'd even want that in shanghai (even though it doesn't require an EOF version bump to add it later, so it potentially being too late for that one for shanghai, should not be a reason to hold off EOF itself; we'd be delighted if it was also still considered, though).",
