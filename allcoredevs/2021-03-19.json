I think we need to re-position this from \"BLS precompile vs EMV384\" to considering them separately, while still comparing the performance. This is because EVM384 (and variants for longer words) has merits beyond BLS precompile, but requires much more time to be properly evaluated (implementation is simple though). So it would be wise not to create tensions between the two. On the topic of BLS precompile, blst (is it the basis for all implementations now?) has a very recent bug patch - 12 days ago: https://github.com/supranational/blst/commit/d43ccfdc0e02e03d63e34e3eca17168801a3c601#diff-8d70da3df599fff655fe429ef420dad10e87c1701a4a32f22256189b93c70c71 . The latest performance comparison numbers (BLS precompile vs current EVM384 evaluation) I got here: https://notes.ethereum.org/--JjliY8T_-qIdvAQKQlcg?view",

If we exec 5 txs, we reset the journal between each. So if we were to execute an extremely large transaction, we might hit new never-seen-before memory issues, in areas we haven't really considered problematic before. Similarly, executing a very large block (even if it is spread out over many txs), makes the 'set of data to commit' to the trie very large. This set is kept in memory, and must at some point be shoved to the db. If refunds are used: refunds are actually also writes, from a db perspective. So without refunds, we do one write. If a refund is used, it's in practice giving a stipend for the second write. So basically, the risk as I see it is that the set of stuff to write becomes too large, which causes problem with IO and might cause problem with the refcounting in-memory pruner. All of these this are pretty hard to explain, because what I'm talking about is really geth internals. However, I would suppose that other nodes also would have similar issues with large blocks.",
