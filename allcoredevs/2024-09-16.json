Find details here: https://pectra-devnet-3.ethpandaops.io/\n- Nethermind, lodestar, erigon bugs have been patched, network is at ~92% participation\n- EthereumJS is having issues, Are clients providing requestBytes as an array  as per EIP-7685? info here: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1283441962107666444/1285170034213257216 \n- We need someone to update the builder-specs such that we can have client teams start/work on implementations: https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs\n- Remote signer API needs updating for pectra as well, is someone working on this: https://github.com/ethereum/remote-signing-api , info here: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/710831784991916072/1285245103622848592\n\n`eof`:\n- Testing is going well and more clients are achieving readiness for a devnet\n- Devnet would depend on fork split decision, likely at ACD this week\n- We'd do interleaved devnets, so eof-devnet-0.... and a decision needs to be made if its done as prague or as osaka\n- We'd need to be careful not to trigger the same bugs as `pectra` devnets to reduce debugging overhead. One approach would be to remove the faucet (we plan this for peerDAS), but the downside is that EOF would benefit a lot from public testing\n\n`peerDAS`:\n- Update on local devnet and its issues\n- Lodestar endianness bug\n- Public devnets once local issues are triaged\n- Devnet cycle would depend on fork split decision made likely during ACD this week\n\n`fuzzing`:\n- Marius would focus on pectra fuzzing and bad block generators (also open call for other clients to implement this and take some load off of him/speed up the fork)\n`general`:\n- We had a brief temp check on fork splitting and what open tasks that would make shipping quickly a blocker",
