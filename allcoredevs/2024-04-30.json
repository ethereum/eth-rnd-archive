Actually this one case is a very good example \u003c@1151103585136943155\u003e  that is proposing the precompile 7696 mentioned above spent time optimizing the EVM implementation and produced the fastest / cheapest implementation. He used very advanced tricks to optimize the r1 EVM implementation (tricks described in the paper here https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/939 implementation available https://github.com/rdubois-crypto/FreshCryptoLib) this work propelled various P256r1 projects and ended up with 7212 / 7696 proposals. I guess we can agree that we're far away from \"copying C\". However a precompile will always be more efficient in terms of money and cycles as stated above.\n\nso \u003c@418000431814279181\u003e IMO the question ain't can it be a smart contract or can it be a nicely optimized one. But rather is the perspective of having a very cheap native way to verify P256r1 / ed25519 / baby jubjub (or just P256r1 in 7212 case) worth the precompile space and time and all cost associated (such as client team dev time; security assumptions if there are any). Worth to mention again that ed25519 is behind SSH keys / Yubikeys / Tor / Graphene OS and plenty of other cryptographic systems we use everyday here is a list of ed25519 in deployment https://ianix.com/pub/ed25519-deployment.html (TLDR it's everywhere)",
