Currently idea is to have 1 opcode, for example, `SIGNER`, which pops an argument from the stack. If argument is 0, then it pushes back the number of signers in the tx. If the argument is \u003e0, it returns the corresponding signer. Signer with number 1 is `tx.origin`. But, of course, this makes this opcode polymorphic. In order to get rid of polymorphism, perhaps the special opcode is needed to getting the number of signers.",
