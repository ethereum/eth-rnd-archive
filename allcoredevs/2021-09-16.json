It'll run for four months during which participants will plan and execute a project focused on something in the core protocol realm.  This is your opportunity to both help these new people find a worthwhile project **and** to get more eyes and brains working on the *\"thing\"* that you wish more people were working on.\n\nI encourage you to open an issue here: https://github.com/ethereum-cdap/cohort-one\n\nIt can be as simple as identifying who you are and what you are working on.  It could be an idea for a tool that seems useful.  Or maybe some data that needs to be gathered and analyzed.  Even things as ambitious as getting an implementation of the verkle trie in your client or prototyping/implementing some other EIP.  Let them know how they can get involved with what you are working on.",
