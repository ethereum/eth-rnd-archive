        "content": "**Quick Goerli Bellatrix/TTD update:** on the CL call this week, we agreed to aim for Aug 8th for Bellatrix and then Aug 11th for TTD. \n\nI started going through the numbers yesterday and by eyeballing the data, it seems that the variance in additional difficulty per block caused by clique means that if we estimate a TTD 4 weeks out, we could hit it in a ~6 day window. This means that if we did Aug 8 \u0026 11th, there's a chance that TTD could happen before Bellatrix. \n\nNote that given Goerli is PoA, this isn't an \"attack\" as much as hard to predict behaviour based on the Clique specification. \n\nGiven this, I pinged the various client teams to see if they'd be comfortable with having Bellatrix a bit earlier, around Aug 4th. This means we'd be guaranteed to hit Bellatrix before TTD, but comes at the cost of less time for users to upgrade to Bellatrix. With a few caveats (figuring out pre-merge auth, dealing with the Sepolia merge block), it seems like teams were broadly in favour.  \n\nTo be *extra* sure we're targeting this right, we're looking at the historical variation in average incremental difficulty over the past ~1m blocks. Was hoping to propose a specific TTD today, but would rather be safe than sorry here, so expect something on Monday at the latest, along with the data/justifications for the actual number.",
