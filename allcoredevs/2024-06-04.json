I don't think I fully understand the reasoning behind separate activation epoch personally. \u003c@466006586477772831\u003e well articulated in the thread below Alex's message that we cannot really do the blob count increase at Pectra safely w/o also doing PeerDAS, and if we did an activation epoch separately for PeerDAS, then we'd also need an EL hard fork to gain the benefits of PeerDAS.\n\nSo what should EL do? It needs to bump the blob count. When?\n\nIf we do the PeerDAS activation epoch post-Pectra, then it seems like that we'd want an EL hard fork around that time to bump the blob count? \nI can see doing 2x HFs, for Pectra as-is and 2025 PeerDAS + Blob Count increase on both CL/EL, I still think that this gives ELs ample time to ship EOF. \n\nSeparately:\n- I'd wager that the vast complexity of the HF even if it's 1-line change is the ecosystem coordination right? So what does that mean beyond timing about scope?\n- On EVM evolution, I had a convo with the OP Stack folks the other day, and it seems unlikely they'll adopt EVM changes not pushed on them by the L1 as they're focused on fault proofs / decentralization",
