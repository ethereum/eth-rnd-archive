I think it would be great if we could do the same for London, as it makes it a lot easier for someone/anyone to compare the various implementations, making auditing a lot easier. I _can_ do the same thing again, unless someone else volunteers (but I wouldn't want to do it on the london tracker, seems easier to just write the changes on notes.ethereum.org than maintain a git history).",
