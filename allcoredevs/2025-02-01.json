        "content": "To be clear, for pectra OP Stack has already done the scrambling and prepped to make sure we’ll be ready for the originally proposed mainnet dates. So given things shifted back a week we don’t need to increase the notice period for this particular fork. \n\nBut I do think that as a general rule, it’s important to actually be code complete in clients with a stable spec before trying to set dates because downstream folk depend on that before we can really get busy testing and pulling in upstream changes to clients etc. Also it’s not great engineering practice to try and squeeze testing to make a date - that just reduces quality and increases risk. As many have pointed out, having a smaller scope and fixing that scope earlier is a much safer way to accelerate timelines and it delivers much greater results as it can shave months off instead of a week here or there.",

That would require changing something much earlier in the process - likely cutting scope or finalizing scope earlier. I’ve been around enough to know that’s not easy and not always possible. I’m not asking to delay this release. OP stack doesn’t currently have a forced 30 day delay for upgrades so we can update quickly and it will all work out. \n\nGoing forward there’s lots of pressure to keep moving towards stage 2 which does require long enforced upgrade delays. We can’t do that if L1 is shipping upgrades with a shorter notice period. We want to enable trust reducing features like long upgrade delays in lots of places through the ecosystem so we need to move L1 development towards better supporting it.",
