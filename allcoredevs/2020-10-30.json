Something like \"loop over X operations\"? If this is correct assumption, is it roughly equal to pairing (miller loop + final exp) of 1 pair, 2 pairs or anything else?",

        "content": "Since it came up on the ACD meeting earlier, I wanted to drop a ~~quick~~ summary of EIP-2938 here to get some discussion started.\n\nEIP-2938 is a specification for account abstraction with the goal of minimizing consensus changes. It introduces a new transaction type, two new opcodes (or possibly three), and several mempool rules.\n\nThe new transaction type drops the gas price, gas limit, and signature fields. The transaction appears to originate from a special entry point address to signal that it is an AA transaction.\n\nThe new opcode `PAYGAS(gas_price, gas_limit)` signals that the AA contract is willing to pay for the transaction. It deducts the proper fees from the contract's balance, and creates a state checkpoint that will not be rolled back if the transaction reverts.\n\nThe mempool rules exist to protect nodes and miners from malicious or badly coded contracts. They prevent things like external state reads and environment opcodes that could cause a previously valid AA transaction to become invalid.\n\nIt's important to note that there isn't a new account type, rather these features are an extension of regular contracts with a standardized prefix. We've also tried to keep this proposal futureproof, and have written about several phases of AA that can be implemented on top of EIP-2938.\n\nAA has its own channel here (\u003c#700028534114222171\u003e) if you'd like ask any questions or discuss further!\n\nHere are some links with more detail:\n - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938 \u003c- The EIP itself\n - https://hackmd.io/@SamWilsn/ryhxoGp4D \u003c- Less technical summary of the EIP\n - https://hackmd.io/@SamWilsn/S1UQDOzBv \u003c- Somewhat technical summary of extensions\n - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKPo-Y74ces \u003c- ETHGlobal talk by me \u0026 \u003c@!415548822983278593\u003e \n - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DUHTJEoaX0 \u003c- Vitalik's AA presentation at EEG",
