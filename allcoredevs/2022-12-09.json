I'm not sure which channel this message is most appropriate for, so pls lmk and I'll move it over! \n\nI'm trying to model the TAM for data availability services in 2023. It's a rough model, but my process thus far is:\n- Linear regression on Ethereum gas fee revenue to predict 2023 annual revenue\n- Assume 80% of transactions occur on rollups, and that all rollups utilise DA services (is this reasonable?)\n- The bit I'm struggling with is estimating what % of of this 80% of gas will be spent on DA services, any suggestions on how I could make this an educated estimate?? \n\nTy!",
