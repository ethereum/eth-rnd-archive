        "content": "**ACDE TL;DW Recap**\n- **Lots of 4844 updates!**\n- We decided to move the precompile on the EL to exclusively use big-endian for inputs and outputs. \u003c@792822129019584562\u003e will open a PR to the EIP to reflect this change. \n- We agreed to switch the transaction encoding on the EL to use RLP. PR up here for review: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6985 (note: even though it's a draft, it's ready for review, it will auto-merge if it's a regular PR). This won't require RLP to be added on the CL, see the discussion here: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3345#issuecomment-1544203603, which we'll continue on ACDC next week. \n- We'll add an extra block validity check to ensure that all hashes in `blob_versioned_hashes` must start with the byte `BLOB_COMMITMENT_VERSION_KZG` as part of execution block verification. \u003c@892053833121923094\u003e will make a PR + write the test cases. \n- We also discussed the state of KZG libraries... no clear next steps though? I suggest we use \u003c#974028042257190933\u003e to discuss. Not exactly the same thing, but related and not really used now? Open to suggestions!\n\nAside from 4844, we discussed two EIPs: \n- EIP-6968: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-6969-generalized-csr-protocol/14178/9 - beyond the EIP itself, we quickly discussed if/when/how it makes sense for proposed L2 changes to \"go through\" ACD. No clear answer, but important topic to figure out!\n- EIP-5656 (MCOPY): no decision on whether to add it to Cancun (we were already 15m overtime). **That said, we should make a decision about which additional EIPs to include, if any, soon. I propose that client teams try to think about the current CFI'd EIPs + other additions like 5656 in the next two weeks.** Hopefully then we can agree on a finalized scope 😄",
