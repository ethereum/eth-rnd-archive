        "content": "**ACDE TL;DW**\n- We had a long discussion about the impact of SELFDESTRUCT removal, and the report linked above. Slides presented: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_sUneROCVIs0hi9sDCErDrd-tQW7nwJVdFmdvIce5wM/edit#slide=id.g230ebfb0d84_0_825 \n- We agreed to keep EIP-6780 included in Cancun, and we did **not** include EIP-6913 (SETCODE) for now. \n- A lot of spec discussions for EIP-4844. We have a tentative spec for devnet-6, which we'll discuss more on the call Monday: https://notes.ethereum.org/@bbusa/dencun-devnet-6 . The most noteworthy change still to discuss is https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7062\n- We expect that devnet-6 may be the last 4844-only devnet, and future ones would likely include more Deneb features \n- Given EIP-4844 is moving to RLP, we've agreed to remove the SSZ EIPs from Cancun (see PR below)\n- We discussed Danno's opcode doc: https://hackmd.io/@shemnon/CancunOpcodeAllocation and agreed to merge it into the execution specs \n- We discussed other potential Cancun EIPs, and agreed to CFI EIP-5656 (MCOPY), EIP-5920 (PAY) and EIP-7069 (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7069). It seems unlikely that anything else, beyond what's already CFI'd (and SETCODE?), gets considered for Cancun. \n\nPR with the inclusion changes: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/763",
