Only team we still haven't confirmed is \u003c@\u0026595681804422479873\u003e. \n- We're planning a last, small, Goerli shadow fork next Monday with all the final client releases. \n- On the CL side, we want to discuss https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3466 further, we'll add it to the ACDC agenda\n- On the EL side, it would be nice to finalize exposing the blob gas price in the APIs by next ACDE.
