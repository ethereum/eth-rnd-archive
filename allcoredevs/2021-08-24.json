The web3 API started out as a mere proxy of the JSON RPC, and later it was abstracted to have a \"provider API\" between the Javascript library and the underlying wallet. However both follow the JSON RPC function naming of the underlying protocol.\n\nThey may choose to expose some of the new APIs, probably the `beacon` one, but I doubt they would take the `engine`.\n\nDo you expect them to do any renaming to `execution` or just keep going with `eth_...` ?",

Actually, we're aiming to make it with as less changes for users as it is possible and renaming APIs is what should be avoided.
