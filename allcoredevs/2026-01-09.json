My initial suggestion for the first session would be Tuesday, 20th Jan 14:00 UTC, held bi-weekly (we can change the frequency later as required). Does this sound good to those who might be interested?",

The overlap is indeed small (probably none) though because FCR is a consensus thing while the log index is purely EL, so I think I'll just go ahead and schedule it if there is no objection 🙂 While Tuesday seems to me like the best choice in general, I am perfectly fine with doing it sooner or later, I just chose 14h UTC because it seems to be the default choice that's more or less acceptable for all continents.",
