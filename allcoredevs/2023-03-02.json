        "content": "ACDE TL;DW Recap: \n\n- Teams are happy with how the Sepolia fork went, and we're scheduling Goerli for March 14th (epoch 162304). I'll open a PR shortly. **Client teams should have releases out in the next few days, and we'll make a proper announcement mid-next week**. \n- Lots of discussion has happened on SSZ in the past few weeks, and it would be good to what should be done for Cancun in the coming weeks. \u003c@881905303011086387\u003e put together this doc as an entry point: https://hackmd.io/y1MCA5Q-R4eMVyOBHiRH7Q \n- Similarly, it would be good to figure out next steps re: SELFDESTRUCT for Cancun. EIP-6190 seems very complex, and if there are other designs we'd want to consider, now would be the time to spec them out. \n- More broadly, client teams/EIP champions/everyone else can use the EthMagicians to share their general preferences/request for Cancun: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/cancun-network-upgrade-meta-thread/12060 - **EIPs wanting to be considered for the upgrade should add a `cancun-candidate` tag to their EthMag thread**. \n- We discussed \u003c@206016661470314496\u003e's three proposals:\n    - eth/66: agreed to not remove for now, because it's the last version to support `eth_getNodeData`\n     -  Removing `pending` blocks/txns: unsure of the impact on end users, going to make a more formal proposal to get feedback\n     - Removing pre-merge sync from networks: hard for other clients to do b/c they support a lot of non-mainnet networks \n- Meta point, though, is that we do want to make clients simpler, and that will require some breaking changes, which we should start thinking about 🧠",
