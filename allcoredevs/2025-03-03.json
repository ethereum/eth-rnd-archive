        "content": "I agree! few thoughts:\n- This wouldn't really show up on code coverage, so fuzzers wouldn't have an easy time finding it based on coverage\n- We're currently planning to revamp fuzzing and our fuzzing infrastructure in the EF to continuously test and fuzz and not only fuzz before HF\n- The EIP came with a lot of test cases, so I think everyone kinda assumed that every edge case was covered.\n- As I said in the post, the same edge case was covered for BN256, but in the old testing repo, so the new testing team was not aware of this edge case\n\nWe hope to run continuously fuzzing on all clients in the future and provide code coverage reports on all clients to spot these edge cases earlier,\nBut setting this up will be a bit of a longer process",
