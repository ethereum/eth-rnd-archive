After the 20th time (I know) I decided to investigate.\nThe issue was that transactions with initdata \u003e MaxInitCodeSize were not rejected by \nthe transaction pool. They would be rejected by nodes executing them, but not by the txpool.\nThis could've been used to flood a txpool with unexecutable transactions.\nSince they are valid looking, they would be propagated to peers and stay in the mempool.\nSo it would be great if all EL teams could check that their txpool rejects transactions\nwhere the transaction is a contract creation and the tx.data exceeds maxInitCodeSize.\nI've pushed my fuzzer here: https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz/tree/mutator,\ncmd/shanghai/shanghai can be used to send a bunch of transactions. Just make sure that \nthe cycle runs a few times and no transactions are stuck.\ncc \u003c@\u0026836981603216654336\u003e \u003c@\u0026652918665943056397\u003e \u003c@\u0026688101493978562687\u003e \u003c@\u0026814631391181930606\u003e",
