I think all other coins combined=around 50ths so I’d say by 20 secs expect a 5-10% decrease in hashrate. Also there will be another 10-20% drop in hashrate in august as dag hits 5gb which will kick most ASICS and the few 5gb gpus off.\n\nWhat would be interesting is if we could estimate how much gas will increase with a 10% decrease in blocks.",
