We've been discussing this a fair amount here -- https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/706868829900505180/849090944325124136.\n\nMy take is that the overall 20% overhead you find is probably not acceptable, that some (how many?) contracts will be slowed down a lot more than that, and that the added complexity of EVM implementations would be rather unfortunate.",
