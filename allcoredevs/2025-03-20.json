(IMHO)\nThe community should have this quickly (appreciate it takes time to do well).\n\nSummaries can be really short (e.g. discuss mainnet Pectra date at ACDE after Hoodi upgrade Mar 26, pre-merge history expiry will be after Pectra (rather than May 1), PeerDAS progressing, EIP-7688 (forward compatible consensus data structures) proposed for Fusaka) \n\nWe have only been using Eth Magicians for protocol calls for ~9 months.  Moderators adding summaries by default is not a habit yet (especially outside ACD).\nAutomated topic creation from ethereum/pm GitHub issues and updating with transcripts \u0026 chat logs is still a work in progress.\n\nBut point taken, I'll wait for 24 hours after next ACD before asking.  \n\nReally appreciate the job that Tim \u0026 Alex do along with other call moderators.",

When I can manage it, I find it's high ROI to spend the extra time to actually get a more detailed summary, but if it's valuable to have a very high level TL;DR ASAP after the call, I can make that a higher priority.",
