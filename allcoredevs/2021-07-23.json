But here are couple of reasons why delay should at least have been considered/discussed: 1) We tried to get releases out by Wednesday last week, presumably to give operators certain time to update. Following the same logic, it would make sense to extend that time 2) Bug on the testnet does not increase the probability of the bug on the mainnet, but it is customary seen as a rough indicator of code quality - and perhaps missing reviews, and/or test cases. I seemed to remember (but cannot find references anymore) that there used to be a \"rule\" in Ethereum that upgrade should be on testnet without issues for some time, or something. If that is the case, we are not really following the \"status quo\" but rather breaking into a new territory",

Interestingly, Geth/Erigon/Nethermind did hot-fix releases yesterday, which did not change the block number (why would they, it would require coordination), but that seems to have \"sealed\" the decision to just go ahead without delay",

I'm only a small ETH dev but I wanted to voice my concerns.\n\nDoes this not have echoes of Berlin? We delayed that fork once and when it eventually went live it hit a consensus problem, resulting in exchange and transaction halting. Huge and scary!\n\nSeems to me when you discover a bug in testnet, there is value in examining code correctness overall of a major project to find out if it there aren't other problems. The amazing thing about this bug is how late it was found in testnet despite, presumably, being present for several weeks through Goerli and Rinkeby. I'm only a small chain developer so I do not know the value of my word, but caution seems prudent to avoid errors here?\n\n\u003c@456226577798135808\u003e comment about prior rules in ETH about testnet issues generating immediate waits is salient, so my anticipation was this would be the same here. \n\nRegardless a decision would need to be made very soon here about whether to  go live or to run on testnets longer for 1~2 weeks. I'd implore ACD to give it some serious consideration.",

It doesn’t help that the calls are public and so people need to be very careful about how they phrase things or risk backlash (as we’ve seen before). Perhaps one solution is to have some venue which isn’t fully public (e.g. Chatham House Rules), and just a summary afterwards ? I’m also happy to book 1:1 calls with all teams, but this doesn’t help in cases, like this one I believe, where back and forth may be required.",
