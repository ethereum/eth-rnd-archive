        "content": "**ACDE Recap**\n- **Dencun:** The Sepolia fork went very well overall! Prysm is investigating a proposal delay issue that may be due to relays. That said, the Nethermind team managed to break devnet-12 using a blob spammer. Over the next week, we'll dig into both of these issues, see blobs expire on Goerli, and have Holesky fork. Assuming everything looks by then, we'll pick a mainnet fork time on next week's ACDC. By then, we'll also try and gather testing feedback from L2s. \n- Most of the call went into details for Verkle, EOF, and EIP-4444/Portal. I won't recap all the conversations here, but here are a few notable links:\n - Verkle status update: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_UkS0WyGN1FK3qYxSBK5zZxBbN8Cx2mFHQj6rQ0jRA/edit?usp=sharing \n- Portal FAQ: https://notes.ethereum.org/@Kolby-ML/HJ-9D5aYp\n- **We agreed to prioritize Verkle and make it the core feature of the Osaka upgrade, which will follow Prague**. I've opened a PR to reflect this: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8159 \n- With that decided, we'll focus the next ACDE on finalizing the scope for Prague: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8121\n- No objections to reserving a precompile range for L2s, so https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8074 will move forward. \n- Lastly, two things we didn't get to cover on the call but want to flag: \n1. Adding client versions in the Engine API: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/517\n2. EIP-7523, see: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/745077610685661265/1202638134928740484",
