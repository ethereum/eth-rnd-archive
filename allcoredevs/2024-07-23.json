        "content": "I hear from the people implementing Electra in Prysm that there's a problem with the db in that to process batches on the CL side we need to either save in the CL db some parts of the payload (the withdrawal requests, etc) or we need to request them from the EL. I was wondering if we could consider using an envelope that contains the payload (and only this is sent to the EL for validation) and the container envelope has all the information that is necessary for the payload to be processed. This is essentially the approach that we take in EIP-7732 and would make Electra forward compatible while avoiding this awkward situation of having to look into the execution payload to save only pieces of it.  https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/0c9ca6de24e27ee717ef8bcfec299be5b9ee77da/specs/_features/eip7732/beacon-chain.md#executionpayloadenvelope",
