That is, the account tuple goes from having the following four fields, `(nonce, balance, storage_root, code_hash)` to `(nonce, balance, storage_root, code_hash, codesize)`. The reason for this is that most key-value databases in use by production clients do not allow peeking at the size of a value pointed to by a given key without actually loading the full contents of the value.\n\nTo avoid forcing a full migration, the following rules are followed:\n\n1. Any account created or updated after `FORK_BLKNUM` should additionally have its codesize written into the account tuple.\n2. Any account which does not have the `codesize` field is assumed to have codesize less than 24KB.\n```",
