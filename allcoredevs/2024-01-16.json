        "content": "Yesterday, I went over the Electra/Prague thread on EthMag (and the CL github issue) and both updated the thread with a summary, but also put the proposals so far in visual form. Figured it could be valuable to share here. \n\nA couple of my takeaways: \n- On the EL side, we have more proposals to sort through than on the CL, although the CL has a greater share of proposals that could affect the EL vs. completely independent ones. \n- Both Verkle and DAS are big enough to probably be their own, largely unique, forks, but nothing else appears to be (although larger clusters such as EOF and SSZ could, in aggregate). \n\nWe can get into this more on ACDE, but hopefully this provides a good basis for teams to start using for prioritization!",
