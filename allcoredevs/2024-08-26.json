        "content": "Hello, devs. We are community passionate about bags, clothes, and accessories. We have over 32K+ members, including designers, women, and young girls, and more than 100+ online stores.\nWe are developing an NFT marketplace and have completed the beta version, including the front-end and aerariumchain company APIs. We plan to publish this platform by Nov.\nBut we haven’t developed the smart contracts yet, so we need to complete them for our NFT marketplace using Solidity by October. This includes functionality for buying, selling, and trading NFTs, as well as a reward system within the community.\nwe have a strong web development team but weak in blockchain development so we are hiring skilled NFT developer who can collaborate with us in long-term basis.\nIf you are available with full time or part time job, please contact me.\nHoping to discuss further via chat.",
