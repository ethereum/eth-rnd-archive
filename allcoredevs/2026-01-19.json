        "content": "To support the discussion on 8037, I did a quick report on a recent analysis about the gas limit increases of the last year and how it impacted gas utilization, base fee and state growth: https://github.com/misilva73/evm-gas-repricings/blob/main/reports/gas_limit_increase_empirical_analysis.md\n\nThe key takeaway for 8037 is how the average growth rate increased from 38 GiB per year to 99 GiB per year, which is more than double. During this time, the gas limit went from 30M to 60M. \n\nI think this stresses how we need to increase the price of state operations in order to continue to scale. without repricings, if we were to increase the gas limit to 300M (and thus take advantage of ePBS and BALs as scaling features), we would likely end up in a growth rate of 400-500 GiB per year, which seems unsustainable.",

During this time, the gas limit went from 30M to 60M. \nCan you explain where these numbers came from?\n\nI think these numbers are client-specific. I shared Besu's state growth numbers in the TG channel last year but will reshare here.\n\nBesu state saw an ~40GiB absolute increase last year from ~210 -\u003e 250GiB\nI don't agree that the rate doubled with the gas limit, I'm not sure the rate even increased at all in Besu looking at the graph.\n\nBesu's Bonsai storage model effectively prunes as it goes because it modifies the trie at the chain head, rather than the traditional immutable data structure-style. I believe other clients now have similar models to limit state size on disk so I'm a little confused why your numbers are much higher than Besu's.\n\nPerhaps the rate increases as you say for a Besu archive node, however for scaling purposes I assume we are targeting the state growth for full nodes, not archives?",
