Even on yesterday's call, the discussion changed substantially when \u003c@360491619402776577\u003e showed up (late 👀). \n\nThat said, given we want to get devnet-6 up, aligning on this was important. So, with the objections raised, the deadline for the devnet, and the fact it's a very small change for clients, we agreed to implement it for devnets and keep discussing whether it's the right change for mainnet. \n\nNow that we've moved most of the devnet talk to \u003c#892088344438255616\u003e, maybe we can repurpose \u003c#1031999860997619843\u003e to focus on that issue?",
