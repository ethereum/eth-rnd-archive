A few minor outstanding issues, but clients are generally performing well\n  * In time for `devnet-3`: target launch in 2 weeks. This devnet will build off of the devnet-2 specs with the addition of EIP-7702. 7702 specs have only been finalized recently, but most clients have a significant amount already implemented.\n  * Touched on EOF and agreed to consider for `devnet-4`, and keep `devnet-3` scope as-is.\n  * Marius from the Geth team raised a point around the benchmarking of EIP-2537, which will need updating at some point before Pectra goes to testnet/mainnet.\n    * Other client teams were asked to confirm the gas scheduling\n    * Expect a small update to this EIP into Pectra soon!\n* Next, Potuz gave an overview of EIP-7732\n  * A particular implementation of ePBS culminating in many years of hard work 🙂\n  * Highlighted no significant changes for execution clients, but did want to get on their radars\n  * This EIP would bring changes for builders (n.b. bids must be collateralized at the staking layer), and details of block production would interact differently with the mempool from today\n  * The EIP is stable in terms of specification, and proof-of-concept implementations are under way\n* Next, a PR to remove `totalDifficulty` from the JSON RPC standard\n  * https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/570\n  * general thumbs up from clients, this is essentially a legacy holdover after the Merge\n* Then, a call for review of an update to the execution layer wire protocol: `eth/69`\n  * [EIP-7642: eth/69 - Drop pre-merge fields](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7642)\n  * Greatly reduces bandwidth usage; check out the EthMag thread to provide feedback",
