You could argue that a champion will form after a positive review of the proposal during ACD. For me if there is no active champion, then it feels hard to take the EIP seriously. This is all in the justice of saving precious time during development and CFI'ing EIPs. One of the reasons BAL has progressed so well in my opinion is because of the latter - the EELS spec progressed faster (\u0026 the tests too) 😉",

I don't think its realistic to ask a non-core-dev to implement the EIP in multiple client, write the test, and build community consensus. \n\nAs a user of the network, it feel like the expectation are so high that (almost) no evolution comes from our end, and that everything is the result of ideas EF researchers and core devs have extensivelly discussed over coffee.
