(q1)\n\nMicah was in favour of bomb to avoid coordination failure in implementing new features we've already agreed we want implemented. But coordination between whom? 4 client teams? (q2) As ethereum governance currently stands, client teams have very asymmetric power, they can ask everyone else to shove it and do what they want (Peter from geth pretty much said this on twitter). As long as this stands we don't need a bomb for coordination among the broader community of ETH holders or users, because it isn't their coordination that's actually needed.  And all teams trivially know how to diffuse the bomb ofcourse.\n\nBomb is not going to force a feature update if one of the client teams is fundamentally opposed to something. And all teams are on discord, they don't need a bomb if they wanna open or retain communication lines. \n\nWould be keen to know his arguments.",
