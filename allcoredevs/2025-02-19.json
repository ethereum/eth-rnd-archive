Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIn that case, I do think the benefit outweighs the drawback\n1. there are tens of rollups currently, and it might be hard to operators (some operated by RaaS), some in different timezones to all wait at the fork period to ugprade\n2. for rollups, being able to timely publish blobs to L1 is important for other features like unsafe / safe distinction, fault proofs, etc, and there are many layers that might rely on that, having to manually change could be less than ideal.",

There are often various inclusion delays for transactions, particularly now that blobs are at capacity and the chains need to handle that. Manually switching is a possibility but it's also very simple to have a flag that sets a timestamp to automatically switch.",
