Austrian economists don't tend to spend as much time calculating and trying to control for everything as Keynesian economists.  If you open up an economics forum, the Keynesians tend to dominate because they love 70 page ultra complex calculations that try to estimate and control for everything while the Austrians just have like 2 sentence solutions to everything (which is usually along the lines of \"let the market decide\").\n\nSo I think the question is whether we want to keep Ethereum hands off/Austrian (technocrats), or migrate to hands on/Keynesian (open forum).",
