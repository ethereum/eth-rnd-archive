        "content": "Agreed, quite humorous.  😆  People need to use reactions more IMO.  In in-person meetings you can look around the room and see people nodding, shrugging, shaking their head, etc. to quickly evaluate \"no comment\" and \"no additional information to provide\", but in voice only meetings there is no such feedback by default.  Reactions in Zoom provide an avenue for a similar non-interruptive way to communicate things like \"sounds good to me\" or \"I don't have anything more to add\".",
