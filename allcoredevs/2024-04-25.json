        "content": "Adding some context on what I mentioned on the ACDE call today about RIP Governance and inclusion in the Pectra upgrade.\n \nAs some of us here may already know that RIP-7212 started as an EIP and was moved to RIP GitHub repo where it got finalized. The proposal is available on both repos except with different “status” and maybe different specs.\n\nBecause this is the first Rollup proposal and kind of guinea pig for future proposals, it is important to consider the proposal in the upgrade with additional thoughts to design a future process. \n\nIMO, some of the concerns discussed in the ACD meeting wrt RIP included in the next Ethereum upgrade can be handled by having an equivalent proposal on EIP GitHub as “Standard Track-Core EIP”. eg. EIP1234: RIP-7212 on Ethereum Mainnet\n\nIn my mind it should go as a new EIP starting with “Draft” and progressing like other upgrade proposal. This will give an opportunity to spec to be changed if needed/recommended as per testing results and we do not have to change the current Ethereum standard process.\n\nHowever, if people consider adopting a different path for “RIP” inclusion, interested in learning more about it.",

Expect an EL test release next week for everything except 3074, as well as a CL spec release 🔜 which fixes a bug in a test but has no Electra spec changes\n- ** EIP-3074/AA**: We discussed 3074 extensively, and more broadly the process by which community input should be taken into account for the decisions around it. No changes for the EIP's status or devnet-0 implementation, but a breakout room is being planned to continue the conversation (see above for scheduling)\n- **Pectra EIP Inclusion:** Before including anything extra in Pectra, we'll continue working on implementing what is already in scope for devnet-0. That said, based on the above, EIP-7685 is now included and EIPs 6110 and 7002 have been updated to take this into account. We agreed to CFI EIPs 7212 and 7623. \n- **EIP updates:** we also briefly discussed the SSZ EIPs proposed by \u003c@881905303011086387\u003e https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/pectra-network-upgrade-meta-thread/16809/65), as well as EOF updates. \n- **L1/L2 governance:** we ended the call discussing how L1 \u0026 L2 governance processes should interact across research \u0026 client implementations. No formal decision, but worth watching for anyone involved in L1/L2 development!",
