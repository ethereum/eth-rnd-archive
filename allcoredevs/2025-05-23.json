This channel is not for announcements either, we have \u003c#595701770034872362\u003e we just need to be conscious of what gets here and what doesn't, but threads are for the most part an annoyance in Discord",

Celo's testnets use Holeksy because of an EigenDA dependency, and migrating them over is in it of itself a huge pain, but to do that twice in one year with Sepolia's deprecation plans would be a double pain. Extending Holesky's lifespan to overlap with Sepolia's successor solves this problem.",
