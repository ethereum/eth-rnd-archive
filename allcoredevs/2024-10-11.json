        "content": "I've been going like a broken record, but the problem happens when syncing in locked step, that is the EL is not just snap syncing but getting actual batches of blocks to execute, and the CL is doing the same, while at the same time serving the ones they have. This typically happens on a starting node for about 64 blocks, because a starting node starts from a finalized checkpoint that happened  6 minutes before starting. But the issue becomes a bit worse if you are starting a node after 2 weeks without finalizing. I believe this is the measure we want to have, not a theoretical one of what clients should do, but an actual performance of current clients (what they actually do) in these conditions. It looks like it's increasingly hard to get this on mainnet/tesnet, but at least we should gather this on large devnets as a naive lower bound.",
