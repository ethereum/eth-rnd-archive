Sharing some part of the article below\n\n\u003e If cryptoeconomics needs a political layer, and is no longer self-sufficient, what good is cryptoeconomics? One answer might be that cryptoeconomics can be the basis for securing more democratic and values-centered governance, where incentives can reduce reliance on military or police power. Through mature designs that integrate with less-economic purposes, cryptoeconomics might transcend its initial limitations. Politics needs cryptoeconomics, too ... by integrating cryptoeconomics with democracy, both legacies seem poised to benefit.",

Don't forget infra providers need to be able to provide access to the existing testnets for our customers, so we need stable officially supported clients that support the merge, and time enough to retool our infrastructure to handle the added complexity of running both clients simultaneously.  \n\nI think such a schedule totally makes sense for devtests and _maybe_ even Sepolia (though again IIF stable merge-ready clients are released a couple weeks before the merge happens on Sepolia).\n\nRather than picking a date, I'd rather we focus on what are the requirements for performing the merge on an existing testnet, then work forward from there rather than backwards from a target date.",
