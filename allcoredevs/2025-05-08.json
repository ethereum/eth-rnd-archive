We agreed to SFI [EIP-7935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7935), with the implication that other EIPs related to increasing the gas limit will be added to Fusaka\n2. In that vein, we agreed to CFI [EIP-7934](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7934)\n3. On Monday's call, we'll agree to the scope for `fusaka-devnet-1`. Client teams, please review the SFI list and prepare your \"sorted preferences\" for CFI -\u003e SFI by the call: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7607#considered-for-inclusion\n\nThe testing team will also review the CFI list and share their thoughts on the testing burden for each EIP before then. \n\nAnd, once more, congrats everyone on shipping Pectra 🎉!",
