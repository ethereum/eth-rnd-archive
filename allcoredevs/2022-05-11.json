Same with circumstances that make it impossible to coordinate a fork (what if WW3 starts and every single core dev below 60 is drafted?). There would be nobody left with enough social capital to coordinate an obviously dominant fork. Without a bomb, ethereum would just survive as-is potentially forever.\n\nAlternatively, right now it's very hard to reject a fork with eg. forced kyc if all main devs were to be forced by their governments. It's much, much easier for normal users to reject a bad fork than it is to organize a competing one.\n\nI hope that war in Ukraine is enough empirical proof that history hasn't ended and extreme deviations from the status quo can indeed happen.\n\nFor these reasons I think difficulty bomb should be gone forever when the merge happens.",
