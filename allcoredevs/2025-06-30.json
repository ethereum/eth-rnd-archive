        "content": "🧵As discussed in ACDT, \"Don't prohibit partial responses on engine_getBlobsV2\"\n\nContext: engine_getBlobsV2 currently prohibits the EL from returning partial responses, which means if we're missing a single cell, the CL side has to fetch all cells from the network.\n\nPR: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/671\n\nWe think we can make a low level change to Gossipsub that lets us transmit only the missing cell, and thus make use of the partial response. I'd like to remove the prohibition so that we can ship this optimization within Fusaka.\n\nThe tradeoff is that CL clients have to handle partial responses today, even though we can't leverage partial responses today.\n\nAlternative:\n- Release a new getBlobsV3 within Fusaka. Tradeoff (to me) seems to require more testing and coordination.\n\nIt would be great to achieve some rough consensus by tomorrow whether to merge this PR or not. Let's discuss here",
