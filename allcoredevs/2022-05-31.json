        "content": "Hi team, does the eth1 client actually report a fully synced status post terminal block without a beacon? my understanding is that once the execution block lives in the beacon block that it must be validated to be part of the canonical chain using the beacon via the engine API, even if the p2p network can continue getting the latest execution data from the execution layer p2p network. Important for us to know this so we can set up our chain snapshotting service correctly. Thank you.",
