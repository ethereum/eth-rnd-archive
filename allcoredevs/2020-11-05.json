        "content": "I did some digging into EVM384 myself, and looks that claims about the \"acceptable\" performance (namely \"as fast as the original EIP-1962\") are actually not true if measurements are done end-to-end (what users will pay for, and I'd say it's the only proper way of measurements) and it's 5-10x more expensive than native implementation. Here is a small report https://hackmd.io/@HQ919cEzRLak4f8-8fPbZA/HJ4u8q3uD \nIt should also remind people about two facts:\n- EIP-2537 has gone through every test and challenge that was thrown at it and is most likely is the highest quality precompile made up to this day\n- utilization of BLS12-381 is not about Eth2.0 at all as there is a huge set of other applications that depend on it, and such applications are expected to be used much more frequently than Eth2.0 deposit contract key verification or Eth2.0 light client\n\nI'd also want to express my gratitude to \u003c@!598593394985533473\u003e for pointing me to the BLST based implementation of EIP-2537 that saved me a lot of time",
