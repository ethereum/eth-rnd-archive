The process could be as simple as\n\n1) ACD team first selects the EIPs and order to be included at the next scheduled fork.\n2) At regular intervals the CL and EL clients will implement three at at time and create test nets\n3) Any issues found during testing pushes the EIP back to the end of the line. This sounds harsh but it ensures that EIPs are better prepared so that critical time is not wasted at the ACD level for implementation\n4) Two months before the fork code is frozen and no more changes are made.\n5) Any addition problems found during testing will have those EIPs removed and added to the top of the next fork for consideration but the fork goes off as planned with as many EIPs who made it through.\n\nThis is just an example and there are a lot of people smarter than me who could come up with something even better. First we have to agree it makes sense and why.",

This sounds harsh but it ensures that EIPs are better prepared so that critical time is not wasted at the ACD level for implementation\nThis is the part that is unrealistic if we want to ship the most important things. They are often the most complex and error-prone, so we can't push them out. Agreed with basically everything else though, and I think it does generally map to our process. \n\nThe other big difference is that if we find an issue with an EIP, it is worth making a call as to whether we should push it back or fix the issue. Historically, we've done both. The downside of \"pushing it out\" is we can't guarantee that when the next fork comes along, another, higher priority, EIP doesn't \"take the spot\" (and if we decide to 'let everything in', we're back at not sticking to the schedule).",
