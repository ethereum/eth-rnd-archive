        "content": "We've been debating the eth/6x versions for typed transactions a lot today and kind of arrived to two possible options for the Geth team. Both work for us, so please weigh in as which option would you prefer we do:\n\nOption A: We roll out 66 (request id), 67 (typed tx in blocks, tx-announce etc)\n - Drawback: Everyone must implement 65 (tx hashes), 66 and 67 before Berlin.\n - The entire network can drop support for eth\u003c67 after the hard fork passes.\n\nOption B: We allow typed transactions in earlier eth protocol versions.  **BUT**\n - Geth will implement 66 (request id), before Berlin. So after Berlin, all Geth nodes on the network will guaranteed speak eth/66.  \n - Geth will drop eth/63 this year, eth/64 by spring 2021 and eth/65 by summer 2021\n\nEither way, **Geth will drop support for anything but the latest eth protocol by next year summer**.\n\nAs it stand today, the Geth codebase around syncing is severely limited by all the backwards compatibility required to serve and query old protocol versions. Up until now this was fine-ish as the chain was relatively locked in, but with Eth2 around the corner, we need to open up the chain synchronization too to new models required by the beacon-chain chain selection. We don't want to tiptoe around legacy things that we haven't used in years.\n\ncc \u003c@!211091239112671234\u003e \u003c@!194432762315407360\u003e If you have anything to add\n\nPS: For us Option A is a lot simpler and less error prone, but we're offering up Option B as a courtesy for other client teams to not have to focus on networking too for Berlin.",
