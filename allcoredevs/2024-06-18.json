The idea was that its a neutral repo thats owned by one person from each client team. It contains the canonical configs for mainnet as well as all the testnets. \n\nSo could EL teams indicate who they want as maintainers for this org and I can add them? \n\nAlso how do we want to deal with members who have moved on from their role as client devs? Do we want to remove their access or should we create a new role for them? Nothing would stop them from still interacting with the org as non-members of course. \n\neth-clients org link for easy access: https://github.com/eth-clients",
