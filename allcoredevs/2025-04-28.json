We will remove EOF from Fusaka, decision about other potential Fusaka EL EIPs will happen on the next ACDE, with a strong bias towards already CFI'd EIPs\n2. For Glamsterdam, we were already planning to revamp the ACD process to bring in more external input into prioritization. EOF advocates may propose this as a core feature for the fork, but the process should be redesigned to accommodate more voices from the community (see: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/reconfiguring-allcoredevs/23370)\n\nI realize many people are disappointed with this outcome, including many who have spent years of their lives working on EOF. I'm sorry for not getting us to a clearer outcome earlier. It's in large part my fault that the process failed to \"do better\" earlier.\n\nAgain, I'm optimistic we can improve this going forward, but I realise this doesn't \"undo\" what went wrong with Pectra + Fusaka.",
