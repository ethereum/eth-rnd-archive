Other nodes may request the full transaction by hash but there's no obligation that a tx advertised by hash is available indefinitely from a node (there's already pruning obviously). If they're only publishing tx hashes then they'd need to store the tx for some period to ensure it propagates well but I'd be surprised if it needed to be for longer than something like 30s and possibly not even that.",
