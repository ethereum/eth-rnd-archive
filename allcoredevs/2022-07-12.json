I think we need to decide which way we're going quite soon, and ideally on the CL call later this week, so that we can start planning for the Goerli merge. If I've missed something, please leave a comment on the HackMD. Will also link on the CL call agenda: https://notes.ethereum.org/@timbeiko/merge-release-strategy",
