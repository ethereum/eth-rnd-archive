I am saying this as someone that was an SRE at a hyperscaler before that was even an industry term. I spent some time in multi million dollar war rooms when I was younger. I know what it looks like when mitigation is foggy and unclear.\n\nThis is a textbook incidient response failure with unclear communication and unclear mitigation attempts. No offense intended. But I am strongly worried about a similar problem ever occuring on mainnet.",

Various patches are being tested and new Holesky nodes are slowling getting brought back up. \n- Work is also in progress to get Dora back up (https://dora-holesky.pk910.de/). The current version still has a risk of syncing to the wrong fork so don't blindly rely on it. \n\nWe'll keep using the \u003c#892088344438255616\u003e channel to coordinate on getting new nodes up during the day and reconvene tomorrow at 14:00 UTC to debrief and discuss next steps.\n\nOnce we've got Holesky under control, we'll more formally discuss future mitigation for such issues, how it affects Sepolia timelines, etc.  but for now everyone is focused on getting the chain back to a healthy state.",
