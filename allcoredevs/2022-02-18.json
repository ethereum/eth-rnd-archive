There are some \"good practices\" recommending using singed integers for arithmetic because it is less error-prone. I don't really want to discuss it. Also Java does not have \"native\" unsigned integer types.\n2. Some years ago I though signed type is more efficient, but I was wrong. However, signed integer still feels more convenient for gas counting. In theory, you can fuse `cmp` and `sub` instructions into single `sub`. In practice compilers are not always right about it (scores: clang 3/4, gcc 1/4) but you can always fix the compiler. https://godbolt.org/z/vT5T8dMo3\n3. However, for unsigned types there is exactly single moment when you can detect overflow. For signed types there is no overflow and value remains negative \"forever\". E.g. you can apply multiple costs and only check once `gas - 3 - memcost; if gas \u003c 0 {}`. Or you can return appropriate error code if gas counter is negative at the execution end.",
