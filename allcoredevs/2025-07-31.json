CL teams, please share your latest thoughts, esp. w.r.t. EPBS. Assuming we go forward with it, we'll also make BALs a headliner. \n3. On next Monday's testing call, we'll review the issue raised about the transaction gas limit. Duncan from 0x will try and share more data about the impact on 0x by tomorrow. \n4. On the next ACDC, we'll finalize the \"happy case\" timeline for Fusaka deployments. Again, it would be great if teams could share their preferences ahead of the call based on today's discussion.",
