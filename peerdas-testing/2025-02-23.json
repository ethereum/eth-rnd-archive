        "content": "The main thing that we rely on supernode doing are these, ordered by importance IMO\n- distributed blob publishing to help propagation and support high blob count\n- reconstruction to ensure data availability (with #1 functional, this is less frequently used)\n- serving rpc data\n\nThe number of super nodes mainly benefits #3 above, but i don't believe there's high reliance on them serving data on a large network - we should also avoid that as much as we can. For #1 and #2 we just need *some* supernodes to be available. So Im not sure if there's much benefit to add accountability.\n\nFor high stake node, I also don't believe there's much incentive to do that - reducing bandwidth usage while sacrificing security (the more columns they custody, the harder for them to get tricked into voting for an unavailable block)",
