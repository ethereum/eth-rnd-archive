Do clients fallback to the CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT if enr is not present?\n\nIt feels to me that ENR should be shared as part of the connect flow, or at least there should be a GetENR request. At the moment it seems to me that ENR has a (important?) role, yet it is only propagated through side-channel (discv5), and not through libp2p. Is that intentional?",
