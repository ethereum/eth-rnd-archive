(For example, if the peer disconnection is from Prysm initiative, there is no specific log.)\n==\u003e I'm adding more logs about peers disconnections in Prysm, and try to reproduce the issue with Teku debug logs.\n\n(I do not reproduce the issue with teku info logs only, but right now I'm not 100% confident of the log level to be the root cause.)",
