        "content": "So for Nimbus I’m working on a flag that the user can optionally put while starting up the BN, there will be 2 modes Greedy and Impartial, Greedy is actively searching for better custody peers and always querying peers with the bigger intersection set.  Impartial doesn’t care who is a better peer it doesn’t calculate intersection it doesn’t even care about finality it simply asks whatever the peers can serve, reconstructs the rest of the columns, groups the columns under the common beacon block header and slot number, persists whatever it should locally custody and moves the slot needle.",

        "content": "I’m not very sure either about it’s performance in normal conditions, there is a tradeoff that needs to be considered: the cpu overhead of computing intersections and thereby filtering out peers sending only range requests that are at all necessary vs sending many range requests, no filtering, based on what the remote peer can serve\n\nIMO if i am a full node the second point looks worse than the first, if i have a good 2048eth+ node distribution \n\nHowever if I am a supernode i think the second strategy just wins big\n\nIn short a greedy sync would be faster but more dependent on the presence of specific peers, and an impartial sync would be slower but should be workable with just enough peers to custody half of all the columns",
