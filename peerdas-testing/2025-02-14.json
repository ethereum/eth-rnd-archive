We've added the function to the specs (https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4128) and implemented it in ckzg (https://github.com/ethereum/c-kzg-4844/pull/534). Hope to have a new ckzg release with this sometime next week.",

I know lodestar was also struggling with this when genesis syncing \u003c@931591385545584640\u003e . It could also be a config issue, but if a node produced the block then the same one should be able to sync it too",
