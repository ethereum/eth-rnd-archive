That said, I will need some feedback.  If you have thoughts on information you would like to see tracked, etc - please feel free to DM me or, better yet - snag some time on my calendar [here](https://calendar.app.google/yKn9qiRDv6BMZbNS7).  \n\nRN, I am just trying to get up to speed a quick convo can go a long ways.  \n\nThanks!",
