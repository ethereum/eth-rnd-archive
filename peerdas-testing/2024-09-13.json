        "content": "Honestly if you guys think local machines are the bottleneck, I can figure out how to get around it. Either get you guys access to a k8s cluster or a really beefy server somewhere. It seems like a group of 5-10 devs need access, which isnt too hard and a lot of you work in different timezones anyway. Kurtosis already does segmentation by enclave, so you won't be overwriting each others work. \n\nIts clear that we'd have to optimize away that bottleneck in the future, but if its gets the ball rolling short term then its fixable with money. Happy to discuss it on the peerdas breakout call if this is a strong ask.",
