        "content": "A quick update on the tests we've ran:\n\nTo see the impact on getBlobs on the status quo, we ran pectra devnet with 50 lighthouse-geth nodes but with `getBlobsV1` function modified to always return nil. [Dashboard](http://94.130.19.237:3000/d/dsfasdfasf/network-monitor?orgId=1\u0026from=2025-04-02T15:07:45.303Z\u0026to=2025-04-03T00:02:36.477Z\u0026timezone=utc\u0026var-network=pectra-devnet-ssl-lighthouse-1\u0026var-consensus=$__all\u0026var-execution=$__all\u0026refresh=1m) \nWe observed the network handling 50 blobs/block without any trouble, so even without getBlobsV1, blob gossiping/inclusion works in optimal, high bandwidth conditions\n\nFor peerdas, it seems to handle about same amount of blobs with or without getBlobs, at about 35 blobs/block:\n- [with getBlobs](http://94.130.19.237:3000/d/dsfasdfasf/network-monitor?orgId=1\u0026from=2025-04-02T04:02:05.411Z\u0026to=2025-04-02T10:12:08.199Z\u0026timezone=utc\u0026var-network=peerdas-devnet-ssl-lighthouse-3\u0026var-consensus=$__all\u0026var-execution=$__all\u0026refresh=1m)\n- [without getBlobs](http://94.130.19.237:3000/d/dsfasdfasf/network-monitor?orgId=1\u0026from=2025-04-03T04:44:53.099Z\u0026to=2025-04-03T11:03:39.165Z\u0026timezone=utc\u0026var-network=peerdas-devnet-ssl-lighthouse-4\u0026var-consensus=$__all\u0026var-execution=$__all\u0026refresh=1m)\nSo, I'd assume that this `35 blobs/block` would be the computation bottleneck for blobs in peerdas, and getBlobs wasn't a bottleneck in this case as well and CL gossip works as expected. \nBut with getBlobs, we noticed that there are more `column processing failures` and higher `gossip verification runtime` in lighthouse. Could the higher blob hit rate from EL cause more column processings and gossip across CLs, even when each of the clients have those blobs from EL? \n\nIn contrast, we did see lower `beacon_block_delay_attestable_slot_start` with getBlobs than without getBlobs, so it seems getBlobs is effective in quickly fetching the blobs for attestation",
