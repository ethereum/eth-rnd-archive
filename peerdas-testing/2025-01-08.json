And once they are merged into the \"official\" fork, then we have `fusaka-devnet-0` incorporating all EIPs?\n\nWe did this premature renaming once in the past with verkle, we had it labelled as `electra` and that seeped its way into types and dependent libs. Now that it isn't electra and we had to rename/rebase a bunch of things, it just led to a lot of renaming/rebasing we could have avoided and wasted dev cycles. This is not a comment on `eof/peerdas` not being in `fusaka`, but merely about premature naming ending up hurting us for no real benefit.\n\nThe main counter argument I see is that we're already activating EOF on `osakaTimestamp` and peerDAS on `FULU_FORK_EPOCH`, so we're kind of already pre-commited.",
