We already have a bunch of kzg infra today and that's what is we are using for peerdas.\nWhy would it be easier to swap out kzg after peerdas v/s after 4844? \nNot saying that we should do fulldas, just that crypto stuff doesn't seem to be a good reason to not do fulldas",

        "content": "One feature of KZG/elliptic curve commitments is that when you add two commitments together, you get something meaningful. So if i commit to value “a” to get the commitment “Ca” then i commit to value “b” to get the commitment “Cb” and then i add Ca to Cb, the result will be a commitment to “a+b”\n\nYou can contrast this to taking the sha256 hash of some value “a” and then take the sha256 hash of some value “b” . If you add the two hashes together, it is not equal to sha256(a+b)\n\nThe current post quantum solutions that we have in mind, also don’t have this homomorphic feature that kzg commitments have, and that fullDAS exploits. There are other inefficiencies with the current post quantum solutions like larger proofs sizes but this one would make it harder to switch from fullDAS to PQ fullDAS because it won’t be a simple drop in and replace in some opaque way",
