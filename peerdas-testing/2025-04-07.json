If it makes sense for the PeerDAS breakout to be at that time, the FOCIL breakout can be moved, or happen in parallel and some people will have to choose what to attend. As for aussie devs, that's fair but also the case for any other important protocol call, and we have all at them at eth o'clock anyway. I think it was an argument that made more sense up until a few weeks ago when there was much more limited participation to the breakout",
