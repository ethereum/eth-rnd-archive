I was also hoping to fix issues first before we move on, but things outside the client implementations are moving fast:\n - latest spec tests release already cover this change, and also has PeerDAS in Fulu i think. We're working on getting electra tests updated to `alpha10` as well, so we'll need these passing.\n- `ethereum-package` no longer support `eip7594_fork` so we cannot use the latest version of it to test\n\nWe don't even have Fulu hard fork set up in Lighthouse yet, so it's getting a bit hard to test and interop with everyone else, so I think we might have to focus on the new features and fix issues later.\n\nThree of the linked issues have been resolved now, so I'll keep working on it - I'm probably 80% through implementation - still need to go through some details like mapping custody groups to subnets, but haven't discovered anything major.",
