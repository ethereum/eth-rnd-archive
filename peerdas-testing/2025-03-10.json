The other libraries have been updated too; but go-kzg-4844 has been deprecated and moved to go-eth-kzg (https://github.com/crate-crypto/go-eth-kzg). go-eth-kzg was updated here (https://github.com/crate-crypto/go-eth-kzg/commit/37673f594ad507e6b6faaad7934feef8472002f4) and rust-eth-kzg was updated here (https://github.com/crate-crypto/rust-eth-kzg/pull/300). And yes, I can make a new ckzg release soon. I've been waiting for a PR to add elixir bindings to be merged.",
