        "content": "\u003e If you request a a specific blob sidecar from a node\nI guess you are talking about the `BlobSidecarsByRoot` req/resp domain.\n\nWith PeerDAS, Prysm does not use it any more. We use `DataColumnSidecarsByRoot` instead.\n\nHowever (sorry I ask more question than I give answers), do we want to maintain this beacon API endpoint `/eth/v1/beacon/blob_sidecars/{block_id}` ?\nIf yes, and if we are NOT a super node, then it means that we will need to fetch / reconstruct blobs to be able to reply to this beacon API request.\n\nTo do so, I see 2 possibilities:\n1. We request `BlobSidecarsByRoot`  from a super-node peer. It replies with the blob, and then we reply to the beacon API endpoint\n2. We request `DataColumnSidecarsByRoot` to some of our peers, until we have enough columns to be able to reconstruct. We reconstruct and then we reply to the beacon API request.\n\nTo add more context, Prysm maintain a `peer ==\u003e data columns` mapping. So we won't query a data column from a peer that does not costody it.\n\nAlso, do we want to add a `/eth/v1/beacon/data_column_sidecars/{block_id}` beacon API endpoint?\nIn my opinion, no, since data columns should be kept as an internal implementation detail, invisible from the external user.",
