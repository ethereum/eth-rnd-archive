Based on info I got from chatting with Age, ENRs are mainly useful for discovering peers, and we are already using metadata RPC request to get information like attnet fields - if we include custody subnet count in metadata, there's no additional info we can't get from a peer connecting to us, that we can get from an ENR.",

(dynamic `q` based on validator count)\n\nWe haven't implemented validator custody yet and haven't made any changes to sampling lately, so Lighthouse's current behaviour is to always sample `s` columns, but I think the desire behaviour would be moving towards the behaviour described in scenario B-1. Excluding any custody columns will likely make sampling stricter although with more complexity.",

We are wondering if we should implement B-1 instead.\nMy main opposition to B-1 is **case 2**: If `s \u003c= q \u003c c/2` , the node may sample no column at all.",
