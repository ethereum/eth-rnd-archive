MORE FLEXIBILITY - can increase blob count outside hard forks\n2. EASIER TESTING - single testnet that continuously increases blob limits at regular intervals to find bottlenecks\n3. TRIVIAL TO IMPLEMENT - i prototyped it in lighthouse and reth and got it working in ~100 lines each\n\nMore flexibility is especially important given that:\n1. It's difficult to say how well testnet performance will translate to mainnet given the number of unknown parameters (bandwidth distribution, supernode distribution, timing games)\n2. There are a number of proposals to improve gossip to scale blobs further:\n\n* https://ethresear.ch/t/doubling-the-blob-count-with-gossipsub-v2-0/21893/2\n* https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/664\n\nWork on gossipsub will continue in parallel to peerDAS work but will likely lag behind. Blob capacity when peerDAS is ready will likely not match blob capacity after these networking improvements. We shouldn't need to delay shipping a moderate capacity increase in peerDAS because a larger capacity increase will be available later. Much better to do a BPO fork once the networking improvements are done.",
