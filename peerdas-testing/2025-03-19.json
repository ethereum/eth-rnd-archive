        "content": "Hi team, during our testing with pectra/peerdas devnet, we noticed that lodestar showed considerably higher block propagation time compared to other consensus clients, and also was the only client that had reorgs happening. Also, it didn't seem to be particularly correlated with the number of blobs in the block (as we've increased the blobs from 0 to 72). You can view the grafana graphs in these reports: [1](https://testinprod.notion.site/Sunnyside-Devnet-Updates-03-11-1b38fc57f54680d8a35dfa4cfb8b852c?pvs=4), [2](https://testinprod.notion.site/Sunnyside-Devnet-Updates-03-18-1ba8fc57f54680a29153e02aaf684620?pvs=4) \nWe'd appreciate any help from \u003c@\u0026595681771690000403\u003e with debugging why this is happening. I'd be happy to provide any logs / metrics or further testing that would be required as well 🙏",

As I'm having the nodes sync from genesis, I noticed 3-4 prysm nodes (supernodes) forking off the chain and slowly progressing on their own. I think just wiping out the db and restarting these nodes would make it work, but I figured we might want to do some root debugging on why this happens. Would anyone from the prysm team be interested about this issue?",
