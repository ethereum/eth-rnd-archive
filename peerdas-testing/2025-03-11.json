Summary:\n- CL teams are continuing to make progress on various fixes and validator custody, with some help from external teams (Base) 🔨  \n- Gajinder proposed a spec change to simplify validator custody, and teams should review and provide feedback ASAP. 👀  \n- We had some EL representatives on the call to discuss spec changes. 🔥  \n- Geth, Nethermind, and EthereumJS will participate in devnet-6. 🚀  \n- **Teams should review the network wrapper change and aim to finalize it in the next 2 days** so that all CL/EL teams can start implementation.🏃\n- Devnet-5 is running well with full nodes; CL teams should verify that the nodes are indeed set up as full nodes.  \n- ethPandaOps will start introducing some chaos into devnet-5.\n- Francis from Base created a roadmap document (to replace the readiness checklist). Please review and help update it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MXf5zTU58mRj0Yq88EPBP1gCJzWTY9FRfUdpZjcfgqw/edit?tab=t.0  \n- **The next breakout call will be on Tuesday at 1400 UTC!**\n\nNotes:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ng2IrCe28kTt1BnIsjtMlKHq2MHgaja24LhFXSvqfJQ/edit?tab=t.0",

Please let us know what sort of metrics or test scenarios that you'd like to see in the future devnets regarding peerdas and blob usages!\nhttps://testinprod.notion.site/Sunnyside-Devnet-Updates-03-11-1b38fc57f54680d8a35dfa4cfb8b852c\n\nIn the result of this devnet, we noticed few findings for `reth`, `besu` and `lodestar`. What would be the best way to get in touch with the corresponding client team regarding these inquiries?",
