        "content": "- No (ish). Whether in 1D or in 2D, the sample count for a certain security level is more or less independent of the total number (and thus also size) of samples. E.g. in 1D we'd be fine with 8 samples (columns) even if we moved to 256 columns, so halving the cell size (doubling `NUM_COLUMNS`) would halve the sampling load.\n- Imo the main reason we would want to lower the cell size is for making 1D sampling cheaper. If we stop caring about 1D sampling completely, and downloading columns is only for distribution purposes (not for security, e.g. same-slot 2D sampling), we wouldn't need to reduce the cell size to reduce the distribution load, we could just download less columns (e.g. we could download 4 columns instead of 8, still halving the distribution load. If we really don't care about security at this step, we could even pack them into a single subnet, e.g. have 32 subnets, 4 columns per subnet and each validator only custodies 1 subnet). We might still want to reduce the cell size to make 2D sampling cheaper, but that seems much less impactful? Given that we're talking about 35 KBs versus 140 KBs per slot, all fairly negligible",

There is a slight dependence on the actual N (number of segments), because we have a  hypergeometric distribution instead of the binomial distribution used for approximation, but the difference is negligible with typical parameters. Details are e.g. here https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Di1-hBae8tZr1tZqcu1JqYycOFy8FdAy\n- The main difference between the 1D and 2D calculation for sample count are in the coding rate. There are some details though:\n    - What we do in the calculations is to put an upper limit on false positives (you think it is available, but it is not). We’ve always aimed for a much more stringent false positive rate in the 2D case than in the 1D case, because in the 2D case we can afford this. That’s why you see 16 (out of 128, but that’s not that important) in one case, while 72 (out of 512*512) in the other case. If we would aim for the same limit for 1D, we would need I think 25 out of the 128.\n    - What I’ve wrote above is also not 100% precise. The 1D RS code gives you an exact bound, but in the 2D case probabilities depend on the erasure pattern. We play it safe and count with the worst case pattern (adversarial erasure). In case of random erasures we would need lass samples.",

Whether we use TCP or UDP, that could matter in situation where we have packet drops.\n- 35 KB vs 140 KB would be a nice difference for someone who does sampling only, but we don’t have such nodes in the plans for now. If we add the block size, and also some custody requirement, it indeed starts to be a negligible difference.",
