Cell KZG proof verification is very fast, just like blob KZG proof verification. The extra CPU usage will fall on L2s who submit blobs. There might be extra CPU usage for validators with a lot of staked ETH, who will be required to custody lots of data columns. They may be asked to recompute/gossip all of the proofs if there's missing data/proofs. But with proofs in the transaction, I'm not totally sure how this works. \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e would know more about that part.",
