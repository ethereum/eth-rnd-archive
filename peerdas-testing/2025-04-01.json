In that case you really need the publisher to have the bandwith and/or to do the right scheduling. If you have that, think should be quite smooth.\nGetblobs adds a few extra diffusion paths (data is popping up in various parts of the network as if you would have several soures or a pre-distribution), but that's not fundamentally different from a good first diffusion step.\n\n In a testnet I think we should be able to turn it off, and it would be good idea to run that test. If not all clients have such an option, maybe just do the net with the ones that have it.",
