        "content": "Hi guys, any thoughts and comments on this [PeerDAS metrics list](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-metrics/pull/14) - verification, reconstruction, computation? \n\nI guess, `beacon_kzg_verification_data_column_single_seconds` and `beacon_kzg_verification_data_column_batch_seconds` could be confusing. \n\nHere is \u003c@654267572107083777\u003e comment on it (copied from PR):\n`typically, single/batched verifications are an adaptive set of tactics used by the clients which depends on anticipated prevalence of failures which require rerunning verifications individually, for example, not per se something that's baked into how a protocol is set up. While the notional stated purpose of these is precisely to achieve a unified UX of sorts across CLs, even the happy paths here involve different batching sizes, which again depends on specific tradeoffs of latency/throughput/tolerance to single verification fallback/many other considerations. These might be difficult to interpret within one client over time, as well as across clients.`\n\nShould we add them for monitoring to be sure kzg verification runs normally? Do all the clients use both single and batch?",
