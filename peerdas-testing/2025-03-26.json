        "content": "I don't think we have arrived to this conclusion.\n\n1, Exposing what you sample, permanently in your topic subscriptions, does increase the attack surface. We can make several steps to decrease this attack surface:\n- One is to sample the columns by sending requests (also called peer sampling).\n- Second is to diversify where you send these requests (part of our sampling design).\n- Finally, one could go for real unlinkability of queries, but that would need anonymized communication, and we didn't go that far.\n\n2. As we reduce the data amount you need in your sample (more columns, or cell-based sampling), the attack surface of individual nodes increases. Without \"more complex sampling\", it becomes easier to attack individual nodes, or to partition the network.",
