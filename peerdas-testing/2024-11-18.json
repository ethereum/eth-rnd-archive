Since we rely on supernodes to do reconstruction, the same assumption can be extended to 2D while we develop distributed reconstruction. We can use reqresp to sample over a (x,y) coordinate. Someone has a key obstacle I'm missing, or has a head-start on formalizing this direction?",

        "content": "A key obstacle would be the lack of a post-quantum KZG replacement that works with a 2D matrix. So if we decide to go full-das now, it would be much more difficult to swap out crypto schemes later on if necessary. For this reason, I believe we should stick with PeerDAS and try to develop a PQC replacement that works with full-das.",
