A big part of this is likely due to the computation bottleneck in the existing version where CL has to compute proofs for all blobs after getBlobs. \u003c@288990561279541248\u003e ‘s report shows from 20 blobs, the computation time frequently hit 4s+ and then 10+s on higher blob counts. I suspect that we might see better results _without_ getBlobs with this version, if bandwidth isn’t tightly constrained - with this version every node on the network spend excessive CPU cycles on proof computation on every block",
