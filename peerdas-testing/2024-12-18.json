Prysm is able to sync from genesis up to the head after the peerDAS activation. (Had some issues with the pre/post peerDAS interface when syncing.)\n\n**TO DO before the next devnet:** \n- Implement https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3832\n- Activate PeerDAS at Fulu instead of Electra",
