(we couldn't do a short call..)\n\nSummary:\n- Client teams are mostly working on validator custody and refactoring and making some progress.\n- `peerdas-devnet-5` was launched 5 days ago and mostly running smoothly (there's a known grandine issue that needs investigation).\n- Teku suggested removing peer sampling concept from the spec to reduce complexity - teams agree that it adds complexity, but there was no strong opinions on changing the spec as most teams have already implemented this. Teams to discuss offline (we should finalise this ASAP though)\n- Nimbus raised a point about researching / estimating network structure with validator custody in place, in order to know more about potential sync speed on mainnet. Will add an R\u0026D task to the readiness checklist.\n- **Breakout call will be back to 1400 UTC next tuesday!**\n\nNotes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ng2IrCe28kTt1BnIsjtMlKHq2MHgaja24LhFXSvqfJQ/edit?usp=sharing",
