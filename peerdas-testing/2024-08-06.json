There isn't an active devnet at the moment and our last call was pretty short as client teams were mostly refactoring and bug fixing. We could bring it up in the call later today (tomorrow for some timezones)",

        "content": "Unfortunately in kurtosis you've got to start with all the participants at the beginning of the run, since the tool is basically defining what the services are and then you can shut down the tool and the definitions will run forever. We'll still think of if there's an easier way to do this, one approach is to block the end of a run until the started services are stopped. But that brings some weirder edge cases imo. \n\nOur \"fix\" for this is to start all the nodes we want, but just shut down some immediately. So its as if they were never started, line to do that here: https://github.com/pk910/kurtosis-sync-test/blob/main/synctest.sh#L97\n\nWe can make this into a variable if different timeouts are needed, that way you can get the same behaviour. But yeah no way to avoid the script easily :/",
