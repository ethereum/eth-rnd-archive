I can't see a specific API for it and while `/eth/v1/beacon/blocks/:block_id/root` looks like what you need there's no way to ask for the latest block root at or before a specific slot which is what's needed here.  Theoretically `/eth/v1/beacon/blocks/head/root` is going to be the right value but since the validator client and beacon node clocks may differ that can't be guaranteed.  An older block is fine but if the head root was actually ahead of the slot the vc was creating a signature for that's not ideal and the vc would have no way to know that as it only has the block root and not the slot it came from.",
