        "content": "Every once in a while a user complains that the state endpoint returned a 404 error. It's because the endpoint is in the `debug` namespace and we don't want to enable `debug` by default. I wonder whether there is a case of moving the endpoint to `beacon`. The reason is that the resulting state is less than fetching all validators from `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validators`:\n- `/eth/v1/beacon/states/head/validators` is 410MB\n- `/eth/v2/debug/beacon/states/head` is 369MB",
