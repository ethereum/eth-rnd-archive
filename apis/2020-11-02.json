We are in a bit of a build-test-modify loop at the moment, in that until the API as-is is implemented we can't test its ability to operate, and see if there are alterations required.\n\nAt current teku and lighthouse are my main test clients, and I've raised various issues against their current implementation.  I'd love to have the API locked down ASAP, but neither fully implement the current API.  And due to this, I can't say 100% that there are no more API changes needed\n\nIf you are interested, I'd happily work with you on a faster loop to try to reach the point where we can lock this down.",
