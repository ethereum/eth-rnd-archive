        "content": "Given that we have a few relatively long-outstanding PRs for the API, is it worth doing a quick all on Monday to go through them?\n\nI think that most of these are non-contentious.  The exceptions are #94 (Update validator status), which probably just requires us picking the set of state names we are going to use, and #96 (Add \"state\" event), which may require a discussion around the primary use case (to allow validator clients to understand when they are able to request information such as proposer duties from beacon nodes).  I can provide a more detailed write-up of #96 prior to the call if people wish.\n\nIt would be great to have this locked down, as clients are providing release candidates and a moving target of an API is a pain for everyone.\n\nIf people want a call, please drop me your timezone and I'll see what I can do to pick the best time.  And if every client team could have a quick look through the outstanding PRs and comment where appropriate before Monday that would be great.",
