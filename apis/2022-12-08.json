        "content": "I had a fairly strong preference to make life easier for users, but there were several ppl that didn't want it to the point of a 50/50 for and against.  My preference would usually be to make things more similar to work flows that ppl will actually use. \nTo me it seemed logical especially if ethdo literally provides that as an output if its offline.\nCurrently the work flow if you're offline will involve generating a file, taking it to the BN, and running each one over curl for us, and that's not super great.\nI can re-open the PR or put a new one up with just that if there's enough sentiment. I do think it's the right way to go but i'm out of time for arguments this year (literally - holidays after today :D)",
