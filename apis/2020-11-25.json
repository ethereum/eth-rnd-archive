Also that it could be retrieved by just using `finalized` to get the latest finalized state which is usually what you want, or lookup by blockId which is what you have from that canonical blcokRoot:epoch pair.\n\nIn terms of the `Accept` header, I don't think there's any real need to have all API endpoints return SSZ, having just the ones that return blocks and states would make sense to me.  Just need to be clear if endpoints that don't support it should just return JSON anyway or reject the request. Either works fine but very useful if clients are all consistent about it.",
