We already have `List[uint256]`, which would encode as `[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]` so it would make sense for `List[uint8]` to follow the same encoding format.\n\nI guess it depends if you consider `uint8` to be  different from `byte`.  I would say that for the purposes of JSON that should be a \"yes\".",
