It's young, but I think if we keep using it and improving what's there, it'll be a great way to validate the APIs are relatively consistent.\nCurrently teku hasn't got all of the standard api's so I get a fair number of errors obviously, but at least I can check the outputs of the ones that I do have. I've even been cutting down the tests that get run so that I can just focus on what I have at the moment in the standard api set :)\nI've found a couple of issues as i've been using it, and they've been fixed in a pretty quick turn around, which is great!",
