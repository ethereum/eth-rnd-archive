It makes sense to support all forks forever for endpoints that read data from the blockchain, but for example proposing Phase0/Altair blocks doesn't seem useful anymore (actually we do propose Phase0 blocks in our end-to-end tests, but that's internal tooling).",

There isn't a massive amount beyond proposals that are outdated.\n\nI think that there should be some sort of general agreement between teams to remove support for given forks, perhaps a policy like \"support  the three prior forks\" so we could remove support for phase0 come Electra, for example.\n\nBut I think the APIs should be updated based on some such policy, rather than us driving such a change.",
