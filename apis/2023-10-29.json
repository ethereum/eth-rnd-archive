Deleting straight away because they're deprecated now would be a bad outcome.",

Some nodes still allow fetching of that data, and I think that is probably 'fair' in the spirit of being able to historically look at the entire chain if you so choose..\nThe new block functions only support from a certain point, for a fair reason. Anything 'validator required' kind of comes into that area where all types can't always be supported...\nThese two examples alone kind of show why I don't think we need a hard and fast rule, we just need to be aware.\nI know all the test nets etc are 'current', not sure if people create private networks often? I've seen a couple float about, I'm not sure what they do in terms of choosing what hard fork they're running etc...\nI'm not sure why anyone would want to run an altair private network (other than testing maybe, and dev...) but there's no real rules saying that you can't...",
