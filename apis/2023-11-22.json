However the EVM only has access to the version hash, and is not aware of the blob index. One can imagine an application emitting an event to signal a consumer of data location. However, without awareness of the blob index it provide all data required to query the current API indexed by block root.\n\nAdding such a new route would require clients to mantain an index of versioned hash -\u003e (block_id, blob_index). The data minimum data requirements per month are 606024*30/12 * 3 * (32+32+8) / 1e6 (slots_per_year * blobs_per_block * entry_size) ~ 46MB",
