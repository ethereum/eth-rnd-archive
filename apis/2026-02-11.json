In principle it's absolutely fine as long as it's not self building (that is the builder index is being actually served by the node) but I can already hear the drums of clients saying they'll support  this or that shady protocol in detriment of client diversity to prevent forks, pools running builder indices to circumvent the non-self-building condition, etc",
