        "content": "Sure, to sum-up #270 and #288 which are related:\n- current API as spec'ed only returns sync aggregate from block. It comes with a ~8sec lag which some apps may find too much.\n- https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/270 adds new route that expects the backend to return the aggregate from the source with the most complete data i.e. with min lag.\n- https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/288 extends existing route to allow consumers to customize **where** the aggregate comes from which indirectly fixes the lag problem\n\nFor a node to produce sync aggregates with minimal latency they need to subscribe to all subnets which a specific node may not do. So the question is how to handle the request for different latency needs with different (unknown in advance) configurations of the API backend consumers interact with\n\nCC: \u003c@881905303011086387\u003e to weight on this too",
