        "content": "I'm looking at the output of the `/eth/v2/beacon/blocks` call, specifically the `extra_data` field, and it seems that we have some divergence with how this should be returned.  Some nodes return `\"\"` for an empty value, others `\"0x\"`.\n\nI know that the execution specs want to see `\"0x\"`, but I don't think that this design should be carried over to the consensus specs, and it doesn't match what we do with byte arrays anywhere else.  Does anyone disagree, or should I raise issues with the relevant repositories to fix this?",
