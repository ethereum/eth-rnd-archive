Are any endpoints expected to return a `500` response when the node is optimistically synced? My instinct tells me that the answer is \"no\" because validator should use the metadata field to figure out what to do. Also what about https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/?urls.primaryName=dev#/Validator/produceBlockV2 ? Shouldn't this endpoint also include the `execution_optimistic` field?",
