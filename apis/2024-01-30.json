Somehow reusing `hive` would make a lot of sense indeed.\nFor `beacon-APIs` we would need a different fixture format probably as we care about more things than just request and response bodies (e.g. `headers` and `status code` for responses).\nUsing JSON and some associated JSON Schema could make sense as it's already used by OpenAPI. Existing payload Schemas could be reused for instance.",
