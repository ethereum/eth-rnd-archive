Passing the full payload to the engine, together with the full blob data, to construct a payload envelope so that the builder signs it to then get it back to the beacon to broadcast does not make sense at all as a default, neither for self-building (which I believe you are already taking care of this) nor for external builders. The default should have no payload nor blob data being transferred either way, neither when the CL is acting as a proposer nor when the CL is acting as a builder (which CLs should implement by default). So we should have endpoints that just assume that the beacon has the data IMO. cc <@&1458826346896687229>",
