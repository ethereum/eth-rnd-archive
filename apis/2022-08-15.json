I'm trying to interpret that. I do have the committee index 39 for slot 3671421 (the slot I believe these validators were assigned to). I'm trying to figure out the validator indices that were included in that attestation. https://prater.beaconcha.in/block/3671423#attestations:~:text=0x94297cf78d5ea3723c02da7fa0d0c6d02ce7a265b9b15a3fd9c9227fa34dce358782f1e41e6860a5a2725ef2e25ec01d14bc74448647d5474e3954f7032471ef534215ba06b5b225d3ce241621134d107b7bf8ebbddaa433629263cb243475f4-,Attestation%20127,-Slot%3A here is showing me only 1 validator (in the UI at least)  I'm missing something.",
