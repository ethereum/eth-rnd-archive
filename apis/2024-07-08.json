There is no standarized api to retrieve this value from the beacon node, and if the validator client is connected to multiple nodes it's not possible to know the value until the actual proposal happens.",

        "content": "I'd have to re-check if there's also a code, but Im not super worried about that specific case (empty string), my hope would be this is a sanity check, not your only source of information, generally speaking its a configured value you'd be expecting to see IMO.\nThe watermark changes every release, so unless we have an endpoint for that too, its dependent on the size of your graffiti. I'm not super worried if people can't see what it actually is at this point - so many clients weren't even watermarking by default (last time i checked teku was it) it also seems very edge casey.\nThe rules for the watermarking are fairly well defined so it's easy to reason on what would happen, and IMO explorers once it's common should probably just filter the data anyway to display in a better format.",
