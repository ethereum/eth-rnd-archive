In reality an alternate chain may always exist because the checkpoint state you use may not have followed normal state transition rules (and you're not applying the historic blocks to check that).  So you always need to verify that the state you get is the correct one by checking against a trusted source (which may mean checking a bunch of partially-trusted sources to build up enough confidence).",
