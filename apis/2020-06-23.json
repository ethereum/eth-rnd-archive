Regarding the specific points you raised in the PR:\n\n   - doesn't make a lot of difference if we use the Fork object in fork schedule (I don't think the call will use previous_version, but using a standard object is a good thing); may as well stick with Fork \n  - chain ID for deposit contract is useful in a couple of situations.  First, it allows ease of use for testnets.  Second, if there is ever a contentious hard fork on Ethererum 1 we'll know which fork to follow\n  - the general \"configuration parameters\" endpoint probably needs better definition.  Need to know how we're returning domains, for example (int, byte array, string?)",

SSE seem to have some oddities in its standard, such as mandating reconnects, but its simplicity is appealing.\n\nOnly potential concern is that the data is restricted to UTF-8, but if we're passing mainly roots (attestations being the exception) that shouldn't matter.",
