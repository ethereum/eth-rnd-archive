We had hoped that it could be a candidate for general adoption, but it doesn't seem to have much interest from anyone other than Prysmatic Labs. If you are a user of ethereumapis, please reach out so we can understand how you might be impacted and offer a smooth migration strategy. Thanks! https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/ethereumapis",
