This idea of this is to provide a superset of the current `head` functionality, moving from a block-based event to a slot-based event.  It also integrates the `chain_reorg` event (rationale inside the PR) and should work in liue of having time-based events for slot and epoch.\n\nI have tried to provide a more detailed explanation for the event: when it is triggered, the specifics of the fields inside it, what it enables.  If any of this is incorrect, or needs further explanation, please yell.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-APIs/pull/96",

Given that the number of aggregates submitted for a given validator client in a given slot should be strictly \u003c= the number of attestations submitted it seems to make sense to change the latter to `SubmitAttestations`.\n\nThis was somewhat due to tests I have been running against beacon nodes, where receiving multiple attestations in quick succession can make them pretty slow to respond.  At best guess there is some work going on behind the scenes that is building up state and/or fetching data from disk to validate the attestation, which I would assume would be beneficial to do once for _n_ attestations rather than _n_ times as I assume is happening at current.  Thoughts?",
