Should it filter the attestations having the corresponding committee index set ONLY, in the committee bits (non aggregated attestations only) or should it also include the attestations that might have other committee indices set (partially or fully aggregated attestation)? In Teku side we went with filtering the non aggregated attestations only btw but I thought it might be worth clarifying",

        "content": "I think it should be former. I think the term \"pool attestation\" means attestations still in the operation pool  which implies unaggregated attestations that are still inside their own subnet/committee. The way I see it is `getPoolAttestationsV2` returns attestations with single aggregation bit and single committee bit, `getAggregatedAttestationV2` returns attestations with multiple aggregation bit and single committee bit, For retrieving attestations used for producing block (multiple aggregation bit and multiple committee bit), use `produceBlockV3`.",
