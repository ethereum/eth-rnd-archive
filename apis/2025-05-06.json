The config/spec endpoint is a little vague, as we don't have any examples in our current config that go beyond string-\u003estring mappings, but even though the above does map string -\u003e string, its kinda ugly and would require further parsing...\n\nso i guess as a concrete example, the json would be \n```\n{\n...\n  \"BLOB_SCHEDULE\": [\n    {\n      \"EPOCH\": \"269568\",\n      \"MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK\": \"6\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"EPOCH\": \"364032\",\n      \"MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK\": \"9\"\n    }\n  ]\n...\n}\n```\nAnyway, interested in what people think, not 100% sure if we need to change the config/spec endpoint definition or just expand the example...",
