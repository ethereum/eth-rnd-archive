It's very hard to find a good solution to a problem we don't actually have.\n Basically we\n- Use keymanager supplied value for the validator if available\n- use CLI provided graffiti if available\n- fall back to empty string if neither\nAll of these get watermarked if there's space, and that watermark won't be reported when you get the graffiti from the keymanager endpoint.  This is one thing that's probably worth discussing (whether the watermark should be returned as part of this query)\nWe decided not to return it because basically it's pretty bad ux to return it then not allow them to set it empty, which is the flow that would happen in teku.",
