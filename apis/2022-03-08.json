I know that Prysm is working on the implementation and it should be there soon, but what about if I use Vouch?",

For individual stakers there will be a simple list in the `vouch.yml` file that allows you to specify fee recipient, either once for all validators or individually for each validator.  For service providers and similar there will be a method to fetch fee recipients from a remote endpoint, which will allow more dynamic fee recipient information.",
