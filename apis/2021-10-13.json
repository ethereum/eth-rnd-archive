Does this align with others' expectations, and if so should we draft up the API (if it isn't already done)?",

PRs get merged, the Open API page gets updated, but it all happens under the radar. If you decide to bump the version to 2.1.0/2.0.1, then how am I going to find all changes that I have to implement? Can we at least have a `changelog.md` file or a Github release that will list all PRs whose changes should be applied?",
