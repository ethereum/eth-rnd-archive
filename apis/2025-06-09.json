My question is what is the \"correct\" thing to do when the client sends `Accept: application/octet-stream` and there is an error. Should the server still repond with `Content-Type: application/json` and a JSON body? Or send only the status code? In Prysm we do the former and I am strongly in favor of this because the client can always ignore the body.",
