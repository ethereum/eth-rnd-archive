        "content": "As a general thought process, I'm struggling to see how lightclient endpoints are going to be actually served. Most implementations aren't likely to export them to the world, as exporting the entire beacon-api will be a non-starter, so how does a light client actually find a node to query this data from, and what's to stop other non-LC nodes from abusing the relationship with that node being open...\nSome of the newer endpoints seem to be getting more expensive on compute, which i get from an LC perspective, but it further reduces the likely hood of people being likely to want to service those requests to my understanding...\nI'm starting to wonder if it is in the right home, or if it should really be a set of endpoints owned by a separate service, that runs beside a normal beacon node that it's getting data from. I know an extra hop is extra latency, but alternatively I'd like to know how LC is going to get data from BN's that don't service open requests generally. Maybe it's just my lack of understanding of the LC architecture...\nI'd be equally happy if there's a good document somewhere to have a read.",
