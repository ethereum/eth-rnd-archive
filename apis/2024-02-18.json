        "content": "I don't think you're missing anything. Lighthouse was previously not doing any validation either, but now we do gossip validation by default on all endpoints and haven't noticed any downsides\n\nWe _could_ add a `broadcast_validation=none` mode to the API spec but this would contradict the `consensus-specs` which state that only gossip-valid blocks should be published. I think if we wanted to meaningfully remove liveness risks in cases of mass clock de-synchronisation we would be better off tweaking the gossip conditions so that a wider range of blocks are accepted _by everyone_. E.g. in the case where my local BN clock is slow by 1s (but my VC is not) and I try to publish, maybe the gossip conditions should allow _all_ nodes with clocks matching my local BN to propagate the block",
