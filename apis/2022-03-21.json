There is a suggestion to have `--safe-block-distance X` CLI argument to defer safe block distance configuration for PoW network to users, same is for `finalized`. I personally think that it's better to start using `safe` and `finalized` in PoS, and use k-confirmations rule while in PoW. But we need to provide users with ability to distinguish between PoW and PoS based on some JSON-RPC call. Ideally, without introducing a specialized call for that.",
