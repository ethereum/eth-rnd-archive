        "content": "taking a look at `/eth/v1/node/syncing` at the moment, and the term `head_slot` is interesting. from the description it does sound like basically the calculated head slot of the network, vs. the last slot where a block got created (ethstats column 'head slot' is the last block).\nAm i correct that `head_slot` in the syncing response is the current calculated slot?\nconcrete example: slot1: block, slot2: empty, slot3: empty\nshould i report back that `head_slot` is slot1 like ethstats, or should i report that we're at slot3?",

It's a more solid basis on which to build, IMO.\n\nIf the API is considered \"trusted\" but the P2P connections aren't, it doesn't seem to be a major benefit to the network as a whole for the block received via API to not be validated, but for the block received via P2P to have to be.  Seems like we're not gaining a lot in terms of speed of transmissions (no verification prior to first hop) and, as you say, opening up the beacon node to being dinged on its score.",
