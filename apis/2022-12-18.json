It will either be `capella` or whatever hard fork comes after.\n\nPersonally I'd be inclined to pick a star starting with D and put it there for now, we can always bring it back in if EIP-4844 will make it in to capella.  Deneb is relatively easy to both speak and type, so that would be my preference.",
