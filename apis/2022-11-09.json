I know \u003c@340345049063882753\u003e was against enshrining a deposit snapshot in the checkpoint sync API, but does that extend to a standalone API (which is presumably temporary). IMO we aren't likely to change the deposit tracking mechanism particularly soon so having this API in the interim is very valuable.",
