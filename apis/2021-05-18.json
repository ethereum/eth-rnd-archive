Technically since this is a new API v1 would make sense if we're versioning the endpoint itself, or v2 could mean everything added in v2 or the whole API could be versioned and everything gets a v2 option (I really don't like that last one).  I'm pretty ambivalent about which of the first two we adopt.",
