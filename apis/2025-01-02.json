        "content": "The attestation rewards endpoint `/eth/v1/beacon/rewards/attestations/{epoch}` does not define the data on which validators should be returned in the situation that a validator is not active (e.g. exited).  At current, from a quick test with validator 102 (in state `withdrawal_done` ) and the latest eligible epoch on mainnet:\n\n- lighthouse does not return information for this validator if no indices are supplied in the body (i.e. body is `[]`), it does return data (all 0s) if supplied in the body (i.e. body is `[\"102\"]`)\n- nimbus does not appear to implement this endpoint\n- prysm returns information for this validator in both situations\n- teku does not return information for this validator in either situation\n\nIt seems like for consistency's sake we should either return such validators all the time, or never.  My opinion is that restricting the output to eligible validators (i.e. those in `get_eligible_validator_indices()`) would make sense.  Thoughts?",
