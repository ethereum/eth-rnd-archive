It comes with the downside of passing around a lot of data which is completely unnecessary in single-node `VC \u003c-\u003e 1BN` setups. Which is why I think the idea of a [standardized query param](https://github.com/shane-moore/beacon-APIs/pull/2#discussion_r2727464736) to indicate whether the VC wants the full response or not would be good. 1-to-1 setups could then default to get the lightweight version of the response.",

While this only takes about 50ms on a perfectly working 1Gbps link, it takes half a second (!) on a 100Mbps link. Say we slowly double the `MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK`, then we're looking at 1 second of data exchange between the VC and BN.\n\nThat is quite a lot, to the point where I would no longer call it a micro-optimization.",
