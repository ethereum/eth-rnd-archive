From what we can see, the `/eth/v2/beacon/pool/attestations` endpoint is not accepting the `electra.SingleAttestation` format as per the spec.  Is this a known issue?\n\n(It appears that the endpoint accepts `electra.Attestation`, which isn't as per the spec and different from other consensus nodes.)",

I left a comment on github regarding this, I hope this doesn't break the oapi spec again, the problem is that the linter doesn't catch this if it's broken and we will just find out after release or I bundle the spec and run it against in out test suite in Lodestar to make sure it works.",
