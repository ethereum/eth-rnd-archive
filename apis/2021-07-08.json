        "content": "Separately, thinking that we should have some more events for Altair.\n\nRationale is that it helps to know what's going on with the network if we can see the sync committee contributions.  Given that aggregator allocation is probabilistic it would be good to see this stuff flying around in real-time.  Longer-term, it makes sense for external clients such as explorers to be able to access this info independent of the blocks in which they may or may not finally reside.\n\nAs such, I think an event that provides received `ContributionAndProof` messages makes sense.  We could also have one that provides the individual `SyncCommitteeMessage`s but I can't think of an immediate requirement for that apart from confirmation that aggregators are doing their jobs.\n\nHappy to draft a PR for this if people think that it's useful.",
