So `/metrics` for prometheus/grafana have values `validator_correctly_voted_head`, `validator_correctly_voted_source` and `validator_correctly_voted_target` which can be 0 or 1. When I hoover od beaconcha.in value that has been attested it shows rewards in gwei for each head, source and target which is always different value each epoch, even if all of values head/source/target  are correctly voted.\n\nIs there a way, using beacoin API, to:\n\n1. At the begining of epoch, determine which slot attestation duty is set for certain (home) validator?\n\n2. Capture if head/source/target is correctly voted (0 or 1) right after end of slot where validators duty for attestation is set?\n\n3. Calculate/capture reward values for head/source/target at that epoch?\n\nThnx in advance",
