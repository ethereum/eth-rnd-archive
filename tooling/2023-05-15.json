The reason it was originally included in this repo is the CLI is a \"reference\" implementation of EIP2335. AFAIK, sCrypt is pretty much strictly better than PBKDF2. I could see some library not supporting sCrypt tho, so I understand that appeal. I see https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/pull/361 is a thing, was that you and if so why was it closed. I'm happy to get something like this included provided it is hidden behind a flag as \u003c@415109946682769408\u003e mentioned.",
