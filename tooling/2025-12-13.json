It is quite a bit to digest! Once I'm done getting a better understanding of how this worked previously vs how the fork choice works after the gloas update, I'll test the nimbus client against one of the others. Once that's done, I'll diff test with more clients 😄 I'll drop a reply here if I find any differences in implementation that leads to different behavior between clients, and a little more about the approach I'm taking to generate the tests",
