I used Lighthouse (because that’s what I’m most familiar with) but I think `ethdo` would also work. I manually inspected the `deposit-data.rlp` generated by Lighthouse to check the withdrawal credentials (I used `lighthouse account validator create` after restoring a wallet from mnemonic)",

        "content": "the format per se supports non-linear, though for interchange of finalized blocks, it makes sense to constrain it - hm, perhaps a flag is in order for this case - it's a feature of the plain index that calculating the index offset is `O(1)` and that when streaming blocks, there's a linear read which makes it efficient in terms of disk access - this is the significant advantage in terms of performance because disk seeks are no longer random and caches work much better",
