I'm considering how concerned we should be about centralization in blockchain explorers.\nEtherscan is kind of the only game in town and absolutely the only Schelling point for confirming, reviewing transactions and contracts.\n\n- Etherchain.org (looks like beaconcha.in sister project) is the best alternative, shows events. So it's not too bad. I don't think it's open-source?\n- Blockscout is also quite good, although underdeveloped compared to Etherscan. And it's open-source! So that is very good.\n- OKLink is surprisingly well developed for transaction viewing, but the rest is very confusing.\n- Ethplorer is way underdeveloped. At least it's aware that contracts exist, but nothing about method calls or events.\n- Blockchair seems to be trying to show contract events, but it has no ABI or anything similar, so all data is just a lot of hex numbers.\n- Blockchain.com is very primitive, treats all Ethereum transactions like Bitcoin's.\n\nIdeally, we would have an open-source block explorer with great UI.\nBlockscout seems like a good starting point, but needs UI improvements to be competitive with EtherScan.\n\nWith account expiry and witness data, this centralization problem might become a bit more painful.\n\nIs this discussed elsewhere?",
