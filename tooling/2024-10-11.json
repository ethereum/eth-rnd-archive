I'm working on integrating assertoor to the still in development [lambda-ethereum-consensus-client](https://github.com/lambdaclass/lambda_ethereum_consensus), I want to make sure the prereqs for integrating it given that it's outside of the known clients for assertoor and I'm getting a `error fetching sync status: get node syncing not supported` but we have a version of `/node/syncing` endpoint in place (There is a [WIP PR open ](https://github.com/lambdaclass/lambda_ethereum_consensus/pull/1324)reproducing it). Thanks in advance and sorry if this is the wrong place!",
