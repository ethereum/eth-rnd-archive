This is a feature release, focused on bringing in additional information from blocks and adding a new module, the finalizer, that updates block and attestation information once finality is achieved.\n\nChanges in this release:\n  - automatically create initial tables if the database does not contain them\n  - add f_canonical, f_target_correct and f_head_correct to t_attestations; NULL if not yet sure\n  - add f_canonical to t_blocks to state if a block is canonical (true), non-canonical (false) or not yet sure (NULL)\n  - add provider functions to fetch aggregate validator balances\n  - add f_aggregation_indices to t_attestations to provide explicit indices for attestations\n  - add t_eth1_deposits table to hold data about deposits on the Ethereum 1 chain (N.B. not currently populated)\n  - add f_block_1_root and f_block_2_root to t_proposer_slashings table\n  - make log level configuration hierarchical; if a log level is not present it will use the next one up the hierarchy\n  - add t_chain_spec table, holding the chain specification\n  - add t_genesis table, holding the chain genesis information\n  - add t_deposits table, holding Ethereum 1 deposits recognized on the beacon chain and provided in the beacon block\n  - t_validators table no longer uses '-1' as an indicator for the Ethereum spec value `FAR_FUTURE_EPOCH`, instead it uses NULL\n  - add upgrader to update the database schema when changes are made\n\n`chaind` can be obtained from https://github.com/wealdtech/chaind/releases",
