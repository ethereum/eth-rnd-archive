Are you planning to store your finalized blocks in this format on disk \u003c@!449019668296892420\u003e? (for serving sync requests, etc?)\n\nI agree it would be more useful with a standardised index format for block trees (not just finalized chains). The git index format* looks kind of clunky, and seems to require sorted entries. What if we standardised a binary format for the ProtoArray, or a simplified version of it? It wouldn't need to sacrifice the `O(1)` access for the finalized portion if we encode the finalized slot in the header, and read accordingly. I.e. split the file like: `header | finalized_slot | linear finalized index | branching block tree index`. The `e2` format could remain the same\n\n*Git index format: https://github.com/git/git/blob/123712ba41164146cd711dab6fe107b62d443f12/Documentation/technical/index-format.txt",
