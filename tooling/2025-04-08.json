I was trying to do some tests running kurtosis/ethereum-package with `electra_fork_epoch: 0` in the [lambda_consensus repo](https://github.com/lambdaclass/lambda_ethereum_consensus) and been having some issues with CLs stoping at launch (tested with various, Lighthouse/Lodestar/Teku/Besu). Moving to `electra_fork_epoch: 1` solves the issue but i wanted to try with an electra genesis. \n\nI'm testing a couple of things, like updating our fork of ethereum-package ([we are a couple of weeks behind main](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethereum-package/compare/lecc-integration-electra...ethpandaops:ethereum-package:main), but wanted to ask here in the meantime because I saw this issue opened and thought it might be a known one: https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package/issues/911\n\nBTW here is a kurtosis config with lighthouse:\n\n```yaml\nparticipants:\n  - el_type: geth\n    el_image: ethereum/client-go:v1.15.6\n    cl_type: lighthouse\n    cl_image: sigp/lighthouse:v7.0.0-beta.5\n    count: 3\n    validator_count: 32\n\nadditional_services:\n  - tx_spammer\n  - dora\n\nnetwork_params:\n  electra_fork_epoch: 0\n```\n\nAnd the error:\n\n```\nAdding service with name 'cl-1-lighthouse-geth' and image 'sigp/lighthouse:v7.0.0-beta.5'\n⣷   ████████████████████ Execution in progressERRO[2025-04-08T13:18:26-03:00] Unexpected error happened reading the stream.
