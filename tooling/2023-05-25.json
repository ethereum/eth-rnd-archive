But basically, I don't want to use something not 'official' to do so (even though there are many ways to do it faster). Totally understand the point about being conservative on such tools, I think it's a niche feature as well for most folks but since it's almost there, if it's not made the default the impact is limited IMHO (the draft PR was short). It concretely divides key generation time by ~2. I'm also aware of other usecases, some software at scale can load keys way faster when in PBKDF2 (for stuff like web3signer, you can 10x with scrypt in some scenario, so if you have thousands of keys to load we are talking like O(10) min or so, just to boot).",
