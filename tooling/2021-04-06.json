Or alternatively are there better tools I should be using?\nSpecifically I think the altair anchor blocks for the fork choice tests are invalid (teku can't parse them but is passing all the Altair ssz static tests) but I'm not sure why.  `zcli pretty block` is my usual way of checking validity and then giving me a starting point to dig into things.",

There's a PR open with a big refactor, mostly done, but left with a bit of sync-committee management (it gets inserted into state before I rotate data in cache, new optimization challenges...). Maybe later this week I'll try updating, I can see how the making the ssz_snappy format more readable would help. That's strange the fork choice test data isn't decoding, I'll take a quick look.",
