The number of Lighthouse nodes seems to be dropping and dropping, with several nodes we know of not appearing at all. Could you give us a quick summary of how it works and whether it's up-to-date? We'd like to work out if there are any changes we've made recently that might have broken Lighthouse detection. Feel free to DM me and I'll make a group DM with \u003c@!498009160982724610\u003e",
