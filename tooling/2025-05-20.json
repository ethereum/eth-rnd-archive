        "content": "Hi all! \n\nI'm exploring using Kurtosis to deploy a single cl and el node pair on a google kubernetes engine. The idea is to have others also deploy their own single GKE node pairs and we can connect and peer up using loadbalancer services. \n\nThe issue I'm having is that the genesis file created differs when I run the kurtosis command to create this setup on a gke using github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package. I have narrowed the difference being caused by the *timestamp* field that is inserted by the ethereum-genesis-generator. \n\nIs there a way to use an already existing genesis file when spinning up a network using kurtosis?\n\nThanks!",
