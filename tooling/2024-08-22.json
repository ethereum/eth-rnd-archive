I tried running it with the following args in kurtosis but it doesn't seem to be sending more than 6 blobs in a slot :\n\n```\n# Configuration place for goomy the blob spammer - https://github.com/ethpandaops/goomy-blob\ngoomy_blob_params:\n  # Up to 3 blobs per tx, and 12 tx per slot\n  goomy_blob_args: [\"combined\", \"-b 3\", \"-t 12\", \"--max-pending 3\"]\n```\n\nI'm wondering if it's because we're hitting max-pending or if the spammer isn't sending the txs, I see `BlobsPerBlock` constant defined here but not used anywhere. It could well be an issue in CL/EL though, but thought it may be  worth checking if I'm using it correctly.\nhttps://github.com/ethpandaops/goomy-blob/blob/master/utils/constant.go#L3",
