The fields `signature` and  `withdrawal_credentials` in the `DepositEvent` are empty. Reviewing other similar transactions like this one i.e. https://beaconcha.in/tx/0xb1494f433a63666ef42a5643d2f214ea509e222c7bf62f4769706657f0dd2312#events , which also tops up existing validator deposit, it has these fields non-empty. Did I do something wrong or the top-up page does something different or maybe it's ok and the the deposit will be added, to the validator's deposit, when it will be fully processed?",
