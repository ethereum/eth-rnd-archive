        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm Stefan from RockLogic/StereumLabs and we're launching StereumLabs today for private early access. StereumLabs provides neutral Ethereum client \u0026 server analytics.\n\nWe'd love to onboard Ethereum client teams first and give you early access to metrics and dashboards. You can also import your own Grafana Dashboards and run them on our dataset.\n\nCurrent scope:\n- Mainnet metrics for all EC/CC combinations (except Ethrex, coming in the next days)\n- Dashboards designed by MigaLabs \u003c@478543974156730369\u003e coming soon\n- Next: PeerDAS node-type comparisons and multi-version runs to study client behavior over time\n\nAccess is at no cost for Ethereum client teams - normal terms of service apply.\n\nI hope to have caught your interest! To get access head down to https://stereumlabs.com/ and request early access after creating an account! We'll get you onboarded quickly.\n\nHuge thanks to both \u003c@199561711278227457\u003e for helping us out and the Ethereum Foundation for supporting us with a grant!",
