        "content": "Received EIP-7916 feedback where some people slightly prefer changing to the Merkle tree layout in the right picture (while others slightly prefer staying on the left).\n\nArguments for left:\n- Easier implementation, as standard left-to-right DFS iteration visits deeper branches first. O(1) memory instead of O(log(N)), or simpler algo. Also easier formulas for handling gindices.\n\nArguments for right:\n- Later list indices are assigned a gindex further right in the tree than earlier list indices. Maybe makes incremental building (e.g., deposit contract snapshot style) a bit easier.\n\nSame for both:\n- Hash count is the same. Proof size is the same.\n\nI'm fine with either, but will lock it down by end of week so that implementation effort doesn't get derailed.",
