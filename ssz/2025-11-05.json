(maybe not in 10 years, but plausable in 100 years)  going to 56 locks us into a 256 cap, and allowing a free int allows for smantic meanings in the nubmers, such as using FIPS numbers like 204 (0xcc) for MLDSA and doing \u003calgo\u003e\u003csecurity category\u003e would make useful things like 2042, 2043, and 2045 for the three key strengths of MLDSA.  (And key strengths will easily chew up algos, apart from curves and whatever happens with zk standards)",
