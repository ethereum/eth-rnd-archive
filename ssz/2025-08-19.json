        "content": "ProgressiveList/ProgressiveBitlist are ready for implementation, not expecting big changes there (tests are available, too).\n\nProgressiveContainer/CompatibleUnion is an evolution of StableContainer/Profile, addressing feedback that has been collected since then:\n- The fixed capacity [N] is gone; instead of a triangle shape with fixed size, it uses the progressive shape from the new lists. Likewise, instead of a Bitvector[N] mix-in, it is a ProgressiveBitlist mix-in. This reduces hash count and is more flexible, as N no longer needs to be properly sized\n- Optionals are gone; especially in Go they were tricky to implement and made things complex\n- CompatibleUnion is a more compact (especially when nested) serialization that can be used for conditional fields. Does not touch merkleization\n\nhttps://pureth.guide/implementations-ssz/\nI have added an implementation tracker here.",
