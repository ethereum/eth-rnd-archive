        "content": "true, 6404 advanced a bit into that direction, indeed (based on feedback from danno ferin)! It combines `algorithm_type`+ `signature_info` into a single `ProgressiveList[byte]` though. this could also be applied to existing transaction types (as in, anywhere where a signature is present, could just give it a different prefix). for signature algos that don't support something like ecrecover, one could also just put the pubkey into the signature as well (it's opaque after all). it's also possible to have sub-algo types (it doesn't have to be 1-byte prefix, can also be longer, if needed).\n\nin your eip the 7932 `additional_signatures` probably should be a `ProgressiveList[AdditionalSignature]` to reduce hashcount at low signature counts (otherwise you end up hashing the full 256 capacity tree), and then just have `MAX_ADDITIONAL_INFO` as a validation rule. what is the usage here, is it for nested authorizations in 7702 transactions? if that's the case, with 6404 it's possible to just apply the algos to the inner signatures as well, rather than \"overriding\" them in a wrapper.\n\nAlso, applied feedback to move away from `identify_transaction_profile` to a SSZ CompatibleUnion.\nThe `assets/eip-6404` folder in EIPs repo contains some executable Python tests, btw (`convert_tests.py`), if you want to make sure the SSZ type actually works out.\n\nbtw in 7932 the `compute_ssz_sig_hash` in 7932 is actually pulling in 6493 as well (6404 initially only proposes a way to represent RLP txes as SSZ)\n\nRegarding the actual registry, I think it makes sense to have it separate from 6404 so it can be maintained as a living doc. In case 6404 gets accepted, I guess 7932 would _become_ the registry EIP (as then we don't need RLP). Otherwise, EIP-7932 would be RLP-only, and EIP-6404 would have to find a way to represent it in the SSZ world.",

There wouldn't be any need for the wrapper anymore, so it would not make sense to keep it around. As we could just use the 7932 registry and the `secp256k1` algorithm that is already defined.",
