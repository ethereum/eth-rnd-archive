Has it been included or not? 🙂\n\nI'm slightly preferring the right side, it retains the order of items and avoids a copy operation for each level in my implementation - but it's really marginal and I don't think it'll be noticeable performance wise.\n\nI'm more worried about still changing the specs. It should really be frozen at some point.\nIt slready takes way too long to get the current version implemented by libs. Keep changing the specs is probably not helpful for this 😉",
