        "content": "Thanks for the thorough response. I appreciate that you see this as non-zero sum, and I've heard similar from the ssv.network team. I think there's room for both (and probably more) to succeed.\n\nIt does sound like both projects are using the Secret Shared Validators approach but are implementing it within different architectures, which is what I meant by saying that SSV is the only approach currently available under the DV umbrella. But regardless, I’m glad to see divergence on the architectural front, and I’m sure many lessons will be learned along the way (where’s the fun if it’s not difficult? 🙂). \n\n\u003e Nonetheless, I appreciate you holding us to account, and I hope you are open to us working to raise the bar and making both of us better for it. I believe we all want the same thing in the long run\n\nAbsolutely! That’s the goal, right?... to make these projects as strong as possible so that Ethereum as a whole will be as strong as possible. And as I said, the objectives seem clear, so I guess the community’s job is just to make sure you stay pointed at those objectives and cheer on the developers through the process 🙂",
