The PoC leverages a threshold key to allow VCs to come to consensus on attestation signing via Istanbul BFT.\n\nCheck out the repo and please test it yourself! https://github.com/dankrad/python-ssv\n\n**2) From PoC to Production**\nWe are thrilled to announce that the Blox team will be leading the work and project management on the official spec and implementation with a target go-live timeline for Q1/Q2 of next year. \nPlease reach out to Alon (@amthatsme) to help out on any particular part of the spec or implementation (DKG, key splitting, sig reconstruction, testing etc.) \nCheck out the high-level implementation plan here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JNRfYSmCzFSZ2f-tAc1m6OgGC8uDkMpB1u-qt0qFcTo/edit#slide=id.g9befc0d429_0_0\n\nWe've spoken with many of you already and have been excited about your openness to support funding for this effort. We will be opening a grants round for the SSV effort in the coming weeks and look forward to your support in making eth2 more secure!",
