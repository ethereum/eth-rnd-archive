        "content": "Right. Imagine you can build two castles: One is where the walls are twice as high, to stop invaders from taking the castle. The second one has only normal height walls, but an underground system of tunnels where you can retreat if you are invaded, and rebuild a new castle elsewhere. Fraud proofs basically give you the ability to do the second. And we will never be able to build walls high enough to secure, say, 10s of trillions worth of assets",
