They exhibit more scalability, with proving complexity scaling quasilinearly in response to computation complexity, as opposed to the linear scaling in zk-SNARKs. zk-STARKs prove to be more suitable for applications managing substantial transaction volumes, thanks to their effective handling of larger computations. Despite these advantages, they have a higher verification overhead compared to zk-SNARKs.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@matthew-pan/is-zero-knowledge-machine-learning-zkml-legit-da312e46505f \n\nit could be trained on financial data, ensuring privacy, allowing collaborative learning and building a highly autonomus and decentralised network",
