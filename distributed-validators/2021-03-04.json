Is it all one validator abstracted by one index? yep thats correct, its transparent to the BC\n* If a slashing committed by SSV (if preventative measures fail), does it mean the whole group of the SSV gets slashed? not sure what you mean here,  if one SSV node is \"faulty\" then the IBFT mechanism either won’t  reach consensus (not submitted  to BC)  or will reach it without it (if there are enough other SSV nodes)",
