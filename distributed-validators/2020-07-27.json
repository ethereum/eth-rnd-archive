        "content": "\u003e SSVs will likely have a stronger impact on decentralizing the signing power of the leading 1-2 providers (e.g. through relative inclusion of smaller providers that may be favourable for anti-correlation strategies), compared to the aggregate traction that enhanced insurance via SSVs will have on those 5+ providers IMO.\n\nWhat's your reasoning here?\n\nThe anti-correlation incentives already act as a check on a single provider becoming too powerful.\n\nIf power does centralise at the start, it's self-correcting over time. Because even if the leading 1-2 providers are careful about both geographical and client software decentralisation, discorrelating themselves from all possible hacks (due to either social engineering, an external actor breaking in, or someone internal going rogue) is almost impossible.\n\nWhat they're less good at protecting against is a cartel of providers reducing shared risk in precisely the ways SSVs encourage.",
