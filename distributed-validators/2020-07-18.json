        "content": "Thanks for taking the time to offer such a clear response. I understand the utility of fraud proofs better now.\n \n\u003e I can only say that I have always seen staking as having some minimal technical competence requirement -- that of setting up a Linux box...\n\nOn this, I disagree, I'd love to see a world in which validating doesn't require any technical competence whatsoever. Just an understanding of the risks and responsibilities involved.\n\n\u003e Without these fraud proofs, one random shard assignment that puts in a dishonest majority in a shard and votes for an invalid state transition, can mess up the whole system forever...\n\nRight, but on the other hand, the easier it is to validate, the more signing power is decentralised, and the lower the risk that a random shard assignment puts a dishonest majority in a shard.\n\nAs you know, eth2's security model rests on the idea that committees are more or less an accurate statistical representation of the overall validator set. As it stands, the chance of an attacker with 1/3 of the validators gaining control of \u003e 2/3 of a committee in a random shard is vanishingly small (probability less than 2^-40).\n\nHowever, if signing power is concentrated amongst a few exchanges -- which we seem to be encouraging with SSVs -- I fear this model breaks down, and fraud proofs will most certainly be required to keep that power in check.\n\nWhy? In a sense, SSVs add more insurance against the behaviour of centralised actors. And this will lead to more people using centralised actors because the insurance makes it safer... **We may well be helping to create a world in which a cartel of 5 exchanges controls \u003e 2/3 of all validators. Would we be happy with that outcome?**\n\nI guess one thing i'm trying to get at is the following: is there more or less a consensus that fraud proofs will be required, SSVs or not? Or do SSVs help tip the balance in favour of fraud proofs?",

Just an understanding of the risks and responsibilities involved.\nThis may almost be a philosophical question. If you don't have any technical capabilities at all, not even verifying a bit of source code when someone tells you it is dangerous and an attack, are you actually adding anything to the network? You are basically 100% depending on what someone sends you as code and are in a way only their \"extended arm\" on the network.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e As you know, eth2's security model rests on the idea that committees are more or less an accurate statistical representation of the overall validator set.

If the adversary can hack some nodes after they are assigned to a shard, it looks very different.\n\nFurther, we may want to lower the thresholds in case the network gets bogged down (because otherwise shards can't make any progress when there's some latency or some validators are down).",

IMO, one of the primary purposes of many-validators is to protect against capture and/or censorship which comes with centralization.  The lower the barrier to entry, the more validators there can be and thus the more resistant validators as a whole are to capture, coercion, censorship, etc.",
