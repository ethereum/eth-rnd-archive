Couldn't we just get rid of that condition and make it such that there needs to be some tx that burns the required amount of ETH but not necessarily make it come from the sum of all the burned eth from each tx in the block?\n\u003e This would allow for account abstraction post EIP1559 again in an easy way and i'm not sure what issues re: eip1559 this would introduce?\nIt was discussed having the burn come from block.coinbase.  I don't think anyone was actively against having that as a future addition, it just felt out of scope for the core changeset.",
