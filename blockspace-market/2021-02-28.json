Which means all participants in ETH transactions that value inclusion will need proportional miner tip. So miner tip becomes  the new gas and the burnt gas / 1559 becomes increasingly inconsequential \n\nThis really means 1559 has no significant effect",

I think perhaps this was part of \u003c@!301186049323958275\u003e's underlying goal. \n\nSome things Micah said don't quite check out:\n\u003e Yep.  MEV is almost entirely unaffected by 1559.\n\u003e The reason MEV is related to 1559 is talked about later in the call.  It has to do with how much 1559 will hurt your mining rewards.  Any gas price auctions will still go predominately to the miners, even if you do nothing today.\n\nWell, actually, no.\n\n\n1. The essence of why MEV is a thing is because miners right now have free rein over the blocks they get their hands on. I think 1559's key objectives (like, an explicit, prominent point in the EIP-1559) was to make classes of \"off chain\" transactions much more costly, so we expect some MEV transactions to be curtailed. (You have to pay the base fee to do any funky stuff, whereas before you paid nothing, and now there's a cost).\n\n2. Also, the \"inclusion fee\" (tip) gas prices is supposed to be vastly lower (1 gwei?) and this might also indirectly lower MEV, maybe even linearly to the reduced inclusion fee, but I haven't thought about this.\n\n3. Also, generally making more space available for spiky transactions (because now you have 2x blocks) seems like it exactly gives bandwidth for the \"funders\" of high transactions that dish out the real paydirt in MEV. Maybe this will cause them to be able to skip making this phat phat payments, but I haven't thought about this.\n\nBut hey, I dunno really, I read the EIP and the top three paragraphs of some MEV article.\n\nI agree that MEV is not directly relevant to the 1559 discussion. It does objectively help many miners here.\n\nRelevant to the deeper discussion on 1559, I think pointing out the existence of MEV is useful in showing that there's a lot of money on the table that miners are not picking up, and this is a comment on some of the other ideas Micah brought up and the current state of miner organization as a whole.",
