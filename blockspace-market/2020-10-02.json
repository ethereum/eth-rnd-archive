Re: simulations, I think there are actually 3 things here: economic modelling, \"happy path\" testnet, and the network congestion. \n\nFor economic modelling, IMO we should aim to get as much done in iPython notebooks as possible, because this means only Barnabe ends up implementing the variations vs. all client teams. If we then have a handful of scenarios we believe need to be tested against more than \"just the spec\", we can maybe have specific short-lived testnets to test them, or even better, tools to generate that usage pattern on a more public testnet. \n\nThe \"happy path\" testnet should allow the community to interact with 1559 and ensure all client implementations actually agree with each other. This is like our current PoA testnet, but should hopefully run PoW (to test that code too) and incorporate the latest version of the spec.",
