        "content": "a lot of vague terms are being used in here like \"healthier\", \"right price\", \"ux improvement\". however the real crux of the 1559issue is the economic model change favoring deflation instead of hash-rate (security). in effect holders win while nethash and miners lose. either way you still have the tx volume spike problem. i will repeat that to me, 1559 may make sense for eth 2.0 (pos network), but not so much on pow (eth1).",
