It seems these TODOs have nothing to do with 1559 itself, so suggest to remove them.\n\nThe current 1559 spec still has this in `validate_block()`:\n\u003e         # TODO: verify account balances match block's account balances (via state root comparison)\n\u003e         # TODO: validate the rest of the block\n\nAnd the test cases section still only consists of TODO.",
