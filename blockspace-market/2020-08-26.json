Miners being overpaid is such a poor argument. Clearly from somebody who never mined, and assumes mining has been a really profitable job, which it hasn't bought my hardware in 2018, went through crypto winter not even being able to pay costs. Now that mining fee's are ok (depends, on your location, most of the world they aint ok). And obviously, I'm talking bout small ops (which are the ones community should take care of, the ones in which the small decentralisation left rests upon), not pools, or giant farms.",
