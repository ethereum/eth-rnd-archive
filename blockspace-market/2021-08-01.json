        "content": "How would this work? If you want to include certain txs then you dont know in the end how much gas will be used. Since the fees on the block will then depend on the total gas used, you thus first have to run all txs, then figure out what the gas used is, and then charge for this gas. But, this can change the outcome of each TX (for instance, BALANCE for any account which has already sent a tx, if you then run different code based upon this balance, then the gas used in the block will thus change, and therefore the fees will also change. So I am pretty certain there are then situations where this block execution does not terminate.",
