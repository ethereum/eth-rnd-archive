It is a PR against 1559 that gets rid of the dual-pools and transition and instead auto-upgrades legacy transactions to 1559 transactions.  This should significantly simplify implementation and notably reduce risk (a lot of the technical risk of 1559 was in the transition period dual transaction pools).",
