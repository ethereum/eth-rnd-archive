I am listing the impacted RPC endpoints as we talked during the last implementers call. In the response of getTransactionBy* there are information about the block (when it's not pending) so it is easy to retrieve the block header with the basefee doing another call. However I was wondering how often a user would need this information. And if it is something like 90% of time maybe it is worth adding directly the base fee",

That caused issues when they failed to increase birth fee, effectively shutting down new births whenever ethereum network got clogged",
