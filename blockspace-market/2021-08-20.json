        "content": "From my experience it's more that ETH holders consider staking to be part of an overall ETH investment strategy.  It's the low-risk/treasuries/gilts piece.  However, it still has black swan risk and they are very aware of that, so they don't consider it a no-risk investment (and as gauging risk is, of course, the single hardest thing, it commonly comes to more of an asset allocation decision rather than a mechanistic risk/reward calculation).",
