        "content": "\u003e there is a reason this attack has not happened yet, I think. This is because mining pool nodes would be the ones that have to initiate it (by mining a very slow block). But because everyone runs the software that is slow on such a block, it does not make sense to make it. If, however, a new implementation appears that is offers a much better (orders of magnitude) performance on the same block, then it becomes a problem\n\u003c@456226577798135808\u003e this is very smart analysis - any block that processes longer than 15 seconds on average actually loses to cheaper blocks so it is hard to attack the network via slow blocks, thanks",
