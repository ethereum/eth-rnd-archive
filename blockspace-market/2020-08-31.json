On one hand, there are a ton of good ideas that are being discussed and we'll definitely want to incorporate some of them in the final version, but on the other, using \"vanilla 1559\" will speed development up greatly for now, and probably still uncover some bugs. \n\nI'm not sure what's the best way to do this, but I'd be in favor of a sort of \"spec freeze\" (aside from bug fixes obviously) with what we have now (incl. the transition period, different tx types, etc.) and then in 1-2 months once we have more data about how 1559 is working, the various potential ideas and the outputs of some of the R\u0026D work, we can do a major upgrade to a \"v2\". Curious what others think of this, and what the best way to do such a thing would be 🤔",

For example, if a new client wants to add support for 1559 and join the integration testnet, they will have to first implement code that everyone knows is going to be dropped only to then excise that code later.  In the case of the current open changeset, that means writing complicated code (migration code) that will be deleted when we drop the migration code (assuming the proposal gets general agreement and merged, which so far is looking likely).",
