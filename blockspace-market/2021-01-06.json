What will happen is hashrates will go down as profitability tanks for miners. Only those with the cheapest power will survive this transition since again you are taking near 2/3 of our earnings ways. This chain will centralize to China as they have the cheapest power with direct access to more powerful ASICS than we can buy in GPU (750mh - 2.7gh models available)",
