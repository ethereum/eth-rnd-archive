        "content": "One of the questions that will help wallets decide on their logic is: How much and how often does the base fee rise?\n\nOr, to reword this: If I set a max fee as some multiple of the base fee, how often will this become non-viable in the near future?\n\nI took a look at that question, with combinations of base fee multiples in range 1.3-3x and time windows 30-240s. For each block I generated a fee (`base_fee * multiple`) and selected the latest mined block in the specified window. \n\nI called a multiple 'non-viable' if the final mined block in some interval (e.g. 30s) had a base fee greater than the multiple.\n\nThat is to say, regardless of what the base fee did during the window, the multiple was considered viable if it the transaction could have been mined using base fee as the only criteria. The priority fee is excluded from all calculations.\n\nThe result was that the multiple was viable in the range 97.7%-100% of the time, details and data in the link.\n\nhttps://gist.githubusercontent.com/perama-v/d23a8d7a446fe8b235889d1a896ab9a2/raw/e3d8e3c51ed5bc156b3d40ac2539dbd681490033/result.txt",
