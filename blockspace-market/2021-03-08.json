This is because we need the \"execute\" step of the fraud proof to deterministically OOG or not every time, so a `gasRemainingAfter` is not sufficient.  Somewhat similar to this check in gnosis safe: https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/cc491fed12487653a8457b80f40183a821e07352/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol#L145",

        "content": "I believe the sponsored transaction problem is different for a couple reasons:\n1. We can (and soon are hopefully) providing a native L1 solution to transaction sponsoring.\n2. Sponsored transactions only need to be sure that there is enough gas leftover at the end of execution to do their work.  They don't specifically need to control how much gas the child transaction gets.\n3. Sponsored transactions can be executed by the caller off-chain to protect themselves, you don't need to run arbitrary untrusted transactions.",
