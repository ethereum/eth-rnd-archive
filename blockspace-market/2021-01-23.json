That didn’t happen, and miners were told repeatedly by the same people who are now championing 1559 that they are not a part of the community. So I’m not surprised that miners now act more selfish than they did before. (happy to continue in the mining channel)",

I can say that it is rather complex (props to whoever maintains it!) but the gist is that they both look at historical prices and also monitor whether transactions sent at the price they recommend eventually go through (if they don't, the oracle is adjusted). All this is done to avoid the reflexivity inherent in any pay-your-bid system: users want to know what others are paying so that they don't overpay, and so as Micah said, the problem is chaotic. I don't know that they can be improved much because this is inherent to the setting. 1559 for instance breaks this by making basefee objective (since it cannot costlessly be manipulated)",
