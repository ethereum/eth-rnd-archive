This period would, perhaps, allow us to guage the sentiment towards and behavior of the 1559 transactions before fully commiting to them. Then we switch to another period (hard fork 2) where only 1559 txs are accepted on chain but the clients handle any remaining conversion from legacy to 1559 to support any stragglers. And then a final (optional?) phase (soft fork) where that conversion is no longer needed because we assume everybody has switched over and the clients begin rejecting legacy txs.\n\nOne issue that becomes apparent with that line of thinking as I type it out is that if the eth client handes the tx conversion, there is less motivation for people to ever switch over to 1559 on their end. And we do want them to switch over, because simply setting tx.feeCap to the legacy gasPrice is not the efficient gas market behavior we are looking for. So I think we would want that 3rd phase where the clients outright reject legacy txs.",
