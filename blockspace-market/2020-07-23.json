        "content": "There may be an incentive for miners to increase the gas limit with EIP-1559, which could be problematic. \n\nRight now, miners don't really care about increasing the block gas limit unless blocks are at capacitiy. Having 20m gas consumed at 10 GWei or 10m gas at 20 GWei yields the same revenue (but the latter is less work!). However, with EIP-1559, miners fee \"revenue\" comes from the tip and is gas price invariant. This means miners get more revenue if they have 20m gas blocks than 10m gas blocks, assuming they make *some* profits with the tips. If left up to them, they could push up the target block gas limit.",
