        "content": "perhaps the main difference with TCP is that in blockchain settings we're all trying to write to one logical instance rather than ping and receive packets from a specific endpoints, so the objective function of the user is different. meaning in TCP you can have client-side demand controls because it's in your interest to not lose too many packets / not receive too many / have good bandwidth, but in blockchain there are opportunities where you want to write first etc. that said blockchains that don't put a huge emphasis on fees for demand (e.g., solana, polygon up to the clog) end up having different ways of expressing that you really want your transaction to go through, e.g., spam or private deals",
