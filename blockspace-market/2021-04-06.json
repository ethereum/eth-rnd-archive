This makes _major_ changes to 1559, none of which have been as thoroughly analyzed, and would require massively reworking client implementations which are already in the final stages. \n\nIf any team working on 1559 disagrees with me, please let me know, but I fear that we'll just waste AllCoreDevs time by discussing it if we already have a consensus amongst implementers that this change is too large for London, and that we need to research it much more.",
