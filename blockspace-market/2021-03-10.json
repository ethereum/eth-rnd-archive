        "content": "What is the best way to talk to Web 3 libraries and wallet teams about 1559 support ? Should we create a dedicated channel ? I have to update most of the tooling (test, performance) to add support of latest version of EIP-1559 (with 2718 encoding). That would be helpful if I could rely on an existing web3 library that already have 2718 implementation and even better 1559+2718. However I don't know the status of the different implementations. Now that the EIP is accepted I think we should consider adding 1559 support to the whole chain sooner rather than later.",
