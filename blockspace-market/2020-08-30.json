While I think this style of argument helps create a big tent, I think the tent for EIP-1559 is too big. From a project management perspective there needs to be a limited set of clear goals. I don't know how we change the current EIP process to handle \"Omnibus\" proposals, again, I think it's fine for you to be in favor of that style and it probably nets out better, but the process we have doesn't really support them.\n\u003c@332923501079953409\u003e I don't think it makes any sense to reduce 1559 to being _only_ about UX. The idea was actually built on previous ideas about aligning incentives by burning a portion of transaction fees - see this article from 2014 which even uses the 'basefee' terminology. https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/02/01/on-transaction-fees-and-the-fallacy-of-market-based-solutions/\n\nI suspect that people have tried to focus on the UX aspect as an antidote to the mindless \"number go up\" mentality which is very prevelant. But I think that the economic arguments in favour of 1559 are stronger than the UX argument which is what I was trying to show in my 'fairness' article",

As vitalik has pointed out, having a high ratio of tx fees / block fees is actually a negative for ethereum PoW security which 1559 will fix. Also, it's a good way to reduce miner revenue before PoS and create better security post-PoS (via lower inflation // higher price).

The idea was actually built on previous ideas about aligning incentives by burning a portion of transaction fees - see this article from 2014 which even uses the 'basefee' terminology. https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/02/01/on-transaction-fees-and-the-fallacy-of-market-based-solutions/\n\u003e \n\u003e I suspect that people have tried to focus on the UX aspect as an antidote to the mindless \"number go up\" mentality which is very prevelant. But I think that the economic arguments in favour of 1559 are stronger than the UX argument which is what I was trying to show in my 'fairness' article\n\u003c@!466048602326695938\u003e  \u003c@!301186049323958275\u003e was adamant that the EIP be single purpose in the past.

Something similar that I seem to have seen (I can be wrong about this) on the ProgPow issue.\n\nFrom my point of view EIP-1559 should be introduced after having already substantially reduced the transaction fees that go to the miners with a much simpler and therefore less technically questionable and subject to lengthy discussions, i.e. burning a fixed % of transaction fees.\n\nOne can think of implementing this mechanism with successive protocol upgrades exactly as it was done in the past with the reduction of the reward per block, starting for example from 30% burned, then 50% and then 80% (approximately) provided by the current EIP-1559 specifications in order to reduce the impact of the rest of the changes for miners and indeed make them desirable.",
