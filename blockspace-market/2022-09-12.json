Will go through both of these. \n\nAnd yes saw those stats actually that are cited in that presentation--I think the big/complex arbs \u0026 MEV bundles still skew everything such that on a $ (or maybe also ETH?) denominated basis, miners still don't capture the majority of MEV economics.\n\nBtw do you prefer I raise questions/ask here or DM you on twitter (or some other venue)? Lmk whatever is convenient/preferable for you",

        "content": "Yeah this was an excellent post. Increasingly coming to the conclusion (maybe slower than everyone here) that MEV is something to manage + goal is to design market mechanisms to re-distribute rather than eliminate. \n\nThere's a curious trade-off here between permissionless-ness vs. magnitude of MEV externality. Worry that mechanisms that attempt to \"eliminate it\" end up re-creating the permissioned, infrastructure arms-race (via colocation, better networking etc) we've seen in traditional exchange venues. IEX (you may have heard of it from Flash Boys) for example introduces a speed bump in an attempt to level the playing field: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/markets/iex-outduels-citadel-nyse-flash-boys-exchange-approved",
