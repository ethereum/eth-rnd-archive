        "content": "No base reward increase unless security is undermined. If 1559 results in a significant drop in hashrate to unsafe levels, then we can talk about it. Otherwise all our virtue signaling about “only changing the inflation rate if security is questionable” becomes just that. Additionally, I think it further strengthens the transition to PoS as those opportunistic miners with no long term commitment will filter out vs those stacking eth to participate in ETH PoS. We don’t want to be beholden to mercenary hashrate who would abandon Ethereum in a moment’s notice anyway",
