I am pretty sure a lot of the community is desperate to get this going and also contribute.\nYes: we left the grant open but the amount we can receive from the CLR just isn't big enough for the areas of funding we currently have left, so we're exploring other options. There is no area of work that is currently stalled because of lack of funding, but some things could potentially be accelerated. Because the CLR funds are fixed (i.e. there's only X00K total for *all* projects) and we took a large chunk of them last time around, we felt it was better to not take any CLR funds this time.",

Is there a current estimate on how much funding is needed currently? I think this is also an important metric to share to the community. I as a community member is very much interested in pushing this EIP forward but lack the technical know how. Sorry if this is a bit off topic for this channel.",
