It allows easing into 1559 and provides a period to catch potential issues or tweak parameters before a block is entirely composed of 1559 txs. As the spec is currently implemented the two hard forks are written into the code at once, so that unless something needs to be reverted or changed it continues directly into the 1559 only state.",

If we want exchanges to switch transaction formats we must either provide all of the engineering support for them to do it or otherwise make it as seamless as possible. I believe a transition period does this.

We can't just fuck over wallet devs, exchanges, etc for no reason, it will tank the price of Ether.\n\nIf we have two transaction types that means there will _always_ be someone who uses the old type, for no other reason than, \"it works on my machine\" that means we'll have two different code paths for no logical reason that do exactly the same thing. Why would we give people a choice when one of the choices is net worse for everyone. By giving that choice, we can assert that _someone_ will take it.

If, however, there is not enough benefits in this change to drive the migration, then perhaps, it needs to be redesigned to achieve exactly what people want it for, which is burning ETH?",

While I think this style of argument helps create a big tent, I think the tent for EIP-1559 is too big. From a project management perspective there needs to be a limited set of clear goals. I don't know how we change the current EIP process to handle \"Omnibus\" proposals, again, I think it's fine for you to be in favor of that style and it probably nets out better, but the process we have doesn't really support them.",
