I am trying to gauge how much lower...  thank you in advance..",

For those, in theory, you want to make sure you are in the next block (vs. next few blocks), and your opportunity cost is quite high. I suspect that will mean those transactions leave a higher than \"reasonable\" tip to be sure to be included. What % of txn fees that represents is an open question!",
