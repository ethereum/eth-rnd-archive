I hope they see this message here. Otherwise, I would appreciate it very much if someone, maybe \u003c@269786774660710400\u003e, let them know about it.\nWhile everybody’s focusing now on how much ETH is being burnt net, as far as I can tell nobody’s looking at it in relative terms and charting the supply rate of change (i.e. the supply’s first derivative), or inflation rate, as a % per annum, in order to see how it’s changed after London. IMO this metric is the most telling of all and should therefore be included in any supply chart either as a a secondary chart attached right underneath the supply chart (preferably) or as a second line inside the supply chart itself, as in this old EthHub chart. Thanks.",
