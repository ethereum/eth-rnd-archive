        "content": "Related to the discussion yesterday about `priorityFeePerGas` (API stuff), I was a bit confused that the EIP 1559 itself has `maxPriorityFeePerGas`. Indeed it seems that the priority fee can be lower than the max a user specifies; what exactly is the hypothetical `priorityFeePerGas` going to return? Is it the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` that was specified by the user, or the one that ended up being used (`= min(maxPriorityFeePerGas, max_fee_per_gas - base_fee_per_gas`)?",
