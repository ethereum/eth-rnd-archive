        "content": "I have a question regarding type 2 transaction replacement on `geth`.  From what I've read, you can replace by increasing the effective gas.  So let's assume we're on Goerli; `baseFee` is 7 wei, and I submit a TX with `maxFeePerGas` 50 gwei, `maxPriorityFeePerGas` 1 gwei.  Since this testnet has an infinitesimal base fee, my effective gas is  at 1000000007 wei.  To quickly replace, I leave `maxFeePerGas` alone and increase `maxPriorityFeePerGas` to 1265625000 wei giving me an effective gas of 1265625007 wei, an increase of 26.6%\n\nUnexpectedly, `geth` responds with a `replacement transaction underpriced` error.  Is this because the base fee on Goerli is so low, or am I misunderstanding the mechanics of this?",
