It is not definitive since we still have consensus issues between Geth and Besu. This is a clique network, currently the block period is 15 seconds. You can start playing with it if you want, there are 3 Besu nodes running. You can submit legacy and EIP-1559 transactions. \nThe block explorer is here: http://eip1559-testnet.ops.pegasys.tech:3000/\nThe network status is here: http://eip1559-testnet.ops.pegasys.tech:3001/\nRPC endpoints:\nhttp://13.236.147.35:8545\nhttp://18.222.108.145:8545\nhttp://15.188.238.162:8545",

        "content": "Any analyzes on correlation between ETH price and revenue from fees? I know that when ETH swings, txs tend to increase (especially with DeFi) temporarily, but seems like historically fees long term volatility is pretty decoupled from ETH price.\n\nThis is good for ETH2.0 since revenue from fees shouldn't be affected too much by ETH price crashing, ensuring stakers still profit from their revenue. EIP-1559 will eat most of this revenue however, which means ETH2.0 security will be almost entirely based on ETH price, making ETH price volatility more dangerous for the security of the chain.",
