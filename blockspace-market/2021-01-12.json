Another way to view this is that right now 100% of the excess revenue in txn fees is captured by miners. 1559 lowers the amount that is captured by miners (by burning the base fee) and gives that amount back to ETH holders via deflation. To what extent it is lowered is not clear yet, but we can assume it will be substantial and that \"mining economics\" will be closer to what they were 1-2 years ago where the block reward is the large majority of revenue. \n\nBurning the fees is necessary to get 1559's UX benefits because we need a way to gauge demand for block space, which we use the base fee to do. If the base fee is not burnt, then miners can influence it, which makes it useless as a gauge of demand.",
