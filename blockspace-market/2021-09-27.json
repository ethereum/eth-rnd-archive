        "content": "Two ways in which EIP-1559 has decreased scaling.\n\n1) Fees are determined by an algorithm which makes it hard to efficiently fill blocks and lower cost\n2) Since an algorithm picks the fee you will almost never guess the correct fee, which means a bit of ETH will be sent back to the sending adress. This leaves dust all over the place and it builds up over time.",

        "content": "1) is incorrect, 1559 has achieved the correct average block size of 15M, plus a little extra, possibly because of the multiplicative formula imbalance. if anything it's better than before where blocks where ~95-99% full with a limit of 15M gas, the target is actually achieved.\n2) is easy to bypass. you had \"dust\" (really more like \"change\") before too because of the gas used/gas limit difference, now you have more change because of the effective gas price/maxfee difference on top of the gas used/gas limit thing, but if you want to get rid of dust and clean an account it's still possible by setting max fee == priority fee == gas price necessary to sweep the account",

In which case sending the change to the miner is better than having it lying around.
