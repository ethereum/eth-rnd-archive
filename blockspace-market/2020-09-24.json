The second largest benefit is that it helps reduce the profitability of certain selfish mining attacks which increase in probability as fees increase.",

When there are too few, the basefee naturally decreases. But when there are too many, users have an incentive to increase their premiums during this transitionary period, until sufficiently many users are discouraged by the basefee level, at which point being strategic is no longer helpful. We investigate this dynamics and briefly compare the efficiency in both strategic and non-strategic cases.",

This means you could have blocks that are 100% 1559-style transactions from day 1, while still keeping backwards compatibility. \n\nIf we did that, then maybe it becomes easier to remove the transition period, because we can just ship it like this, and then wait and see how much 1559 volume picks up. Worst case: 1559 gets 0 adoption, we have the same throughput as today of legacy txns. \"Best\" (for 1559) case, we get ~100% of transactions in 1559-style quite rapidly.",
