Escalator brings 4 fields (startPrice, maxPrice, startBlock, endBlock). And they don't have the same types nor the same meanings. RLP structure is not \"smart\", you cannot know what represents a field by a key or something. It is order dependent and you have to know what type to read when you decode. In current Besu implementation and in Geth EIP 1559 PR, the RLP encoding / decoding has been updated to take care of the 2 new fields. But because both EIP -1559 and escalator bring value on their own the combinations for decoding are numerous. Or we would have to have optional fields, or placeholder values or something to discriminate. Having a clear type of transaction makes it much more easy to handle",
