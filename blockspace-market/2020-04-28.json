I have a database with mempool data in it, but to be frank, I don't have a dev available to go splunking in it for free. blocknative should have the data as well and might be interested in providing it for free. If we get another grant to do further development for this project we will be able to make that data available to researchers. I just don't have the capacity to pay developers in marketing opportunities. 😦",
