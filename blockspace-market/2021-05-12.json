        "content": "just ran into this myself, i think it would be great to fix these references in the spec and address the minimum limit with the answer of 7 wei, as many implementers will probably wonder.\nwe are discussing in ethereumjs what a default block's base fee should be. the initial_value? 0? 1? 7?\ni also agree with micah that we should have test cases for these boundary conditions",

        "content": "That one is perfectly fine imo, but `priorityFeePerGas` was proposed for the API. And that one would then be a bit vague in whether it's the _max_, or _effective_ priority fee per gas. (Related to the use of \"cap\" in the earlier proposed `gasTipCap` )",

        "content": "I was more on the side of allowing the base fee to go to zero last time this topic came up, to avoid these choices you mention and make things a bit more uniform. It'd also make the if/else branches more similar. But doing so would be a rather last-minute change to the spec, and a possibly consensus-breaking one at that.",
