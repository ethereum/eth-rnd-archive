The purpose of the tip is for really spiky demand so that people who are willing to pay large amounts don't have to wait for the base fee to go higher and to capture mev. The basefee has a cap on how quickly it can surge and drop because there are technical tradeoff with letting it go up or down too slowly or quickly. The tip is more of a release valve. Ideally it wouldn't be necessary but blockspace demand and mev are too volatile to not have a tip system.",
