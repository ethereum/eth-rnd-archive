        "content": "Hi, I know this is a pretty trivial question for you guys but I couldn't find an clear answer on all the resources I read so far (shame on me, I skipped the paper 😜 ) so I assume you can help me.\nIf network activity is high and the BASEFEE increases with every block, what happens to the BASEFEE for the first block which is less than 50% packed (let's say block N+1)? Does it decrease to the BASEFEE which was present in block N-1 (or by 12.5%) or does it drop to a kind of base level and starting all over again to rise if network activity goes up? I think the latter doesn't make sense while thinking briefly about it but maybe I'm missing something. Thanks for your help.",

Thanks a ton.\nJust another short question with regards to your reply, because this is new to me as well.\nIf block N is packed with 14 million gas and N+1 is packed with 20 million the BASEFEE on block N+1 would be: BASEFEE of N + (BASEFEE of N * 0.06). Is that correct?",
