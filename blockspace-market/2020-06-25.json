I wanted to let everyone know that EF is currently considering a proposal to study the impact of block size vs propagation times and uncle rate on a private testnet, as well as coordinating with another team that will be studying this on mainnet.  Just mentioning this in case other people were planning something like this - hopefully we can avoid duplicating effort!",

And if they are separate and happen in the same hardfork they are mutually exclusive if we don't combine them. Both are changing the RLP structure of transactions, in a mutually exclusive way if you take them separately. Unless you accept both formats, but that would mean 2 different possible UX, which would be the worse scenario IMO. A combination of both would end up in a unique EIP right ? For example if you look at Barnabe's proposal to merge them:  https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eip1559/combination.md#floating-escalator-started-on-basefee. Do you see a way to handle this with 2 different EIPs ? Maybe i am missing something but i don't see a way to do so.",

This isnt better than what we do now. The dynamic block size would honestly be the valuable part here but then would it be fair to say that base fee just there to stop miners paying themselves to up the fee? Why not just make base fee be a block fee not transaction fee based on block size but miners get like .5 of the rest of the fees. \n\nSo transactions pay the fee to the block. Base fee gets based off block size so that as more transactions get put in base fee goes up exp. Tx fees get paid to cover base fee and miner gets the rest. If the miner fills their own transactions they lose base fee and .5 the rest. That way there will be no need for tips or for trying to outbid as miners will try to fill blocks as high as they can until the base fee gets higher than the return and they start getting charged",
