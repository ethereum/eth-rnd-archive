One final question: each transaction a miner includes increases the uncle risk, so unless tip \u003e (probabilistic loss from marginal uncle risk), wouldn't miners choose empty blocks over a 1-nanoeth tip? I don't know how to quantify that uncle risk, but it does seem like the tip would need to stabilize at a value greater than the opportunity cost of an empty block.",

If the previous block was larger than desired, fee is increased slightly. If the previous block was smaller than desired, fee is decreased slightly. This leads to an equilibrium where the average block size equals the target over time. Fees must be burned rather than paid to miners to prevent off-chain collusion to manipulate the fee.",
