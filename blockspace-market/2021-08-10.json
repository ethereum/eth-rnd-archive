It would be super interesting to compare how quickly we get through different magnitudes of base fee increases vs. pre-london when we had massive gas price increases (which often lasted hours). \n\nJust by virtue of adding more blockspace, you'd expect 1559 to yield a 2x improvement, but my gut feel is that we're probably seeing much more than that.",
