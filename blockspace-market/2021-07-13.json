I suppose my question / comment is really directed at the \"way\" that miners have thus organized the gas limit to my understanding has been mostly ad hoc (but decently coordinated). when we go to PoS to produce blocks that responsibility then shifts to this \"blob\" of validators.. many of them will do what they will do.. and that is fine.. that said, I do believe it wise to have an informal recommendation body (bordering on a committee) to provide guidance as to what is recommended for the then situation.",
