Most miners just sort by highest gas price, so it's easy for frontrunners to compete to be the first while in the mempool, but I wonder if it will be the same post EIP-1559. Right now miners probably extract *some* of the revenue from the frontrunning that pay high gas prices, but curious what will happen post EIP-1559",
