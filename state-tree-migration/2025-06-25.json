        "content": "great, thank you! for some context: i'm leading research at vlayer labs, but also I'm coordinating educational yt channel zkMarek (https://www.youtube.com/@zkmarek). we are about to release a long episode about verkle trees, very comprehensive and as always with great 3b1b style animations (we're using manim library). \n\nas the topic is broad and fairly complex I would love to hear some feedback from people invested in state tree change efforts. can I DM you a beta version of the video later today and request for comments before we go live with it? \n\nI'd prefer not to share it on public channel though, so please leave a reaction to this message if you're okay with me sending you a link later today",
