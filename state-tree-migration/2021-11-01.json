Proposer index computation requires 3 things: \n- Randao mix of the (n-2) epoch\n- Active indices\n- Effective balances\n\nActive indices have a 2 epoch active/exit delay while effective balances change at the end of each epoch. Effective balances change very rarely in mainnet and usually would only be decreased in the event of a slashing  or continious penalty.  Using these 3 things, you could precompute proposer assignments in advance.",
