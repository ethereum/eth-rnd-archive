This group is known as a quotient group, and we are essentially saying that P and P+D0 are in the same equivalence class.",

What I mean is that my private key is `5 mod p` , and every number equivalent to `5 mod p`  is also my private key. But we usually restrict our focus to numbers between 0 and p-1 and say that there are `p` numbers",
