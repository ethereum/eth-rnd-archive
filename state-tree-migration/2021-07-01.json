My reading of the last part of that message is that there are curves that satisfy:\n1) there's some inconvenient to compute pairings either with their Jacobian or any other.\n2) it is much faster to compute the group operation on these curves.\n3) the complexity of computing logarithm is still hard (sorry for the lack of terminology, not from this field).\n2 and 3 at the same time sound surprising to me.",
