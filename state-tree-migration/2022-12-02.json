(Took me a while just because I had to buy a 2TiB SSD and sync a node at home; not only for this but for other future things I'm interested too)\nYou can access it here: https://hackmd.io/@jsign/geth-mpt-analysis\n\nThe tool I created to generate this report can be inspected here: https://github.com/jsign/verkle-vs-patricia/pull/5 (no need to look at code, just mentioning it if somebody else is interested).\nAnyone with a Geth node can run this tool to reproduce the results (you have to stop it, and provide in `--chaindata` the path of the chaindata folder so the tool can access directly the leveldb database).",
