I'm new to the space so bear with me 😄\nI'm looking particularly at this part:\n```\nRemove EIP-2200 SSTORE gas costs except for the SLOAD_GAS\n```\n\nThough while checking EIP-2200 there's a part that talks about refunds whereby:\n```\nIf original value equals new value (this storage slot is reset)\n\n    If original value is 0, add SSTORE_SET_GAS - SLOAD_GAS to refund counter.\n    Otherwise, add SSTORE_RESET_GAS - SLOAD_GAS gas to refund counter.\n```\n\nShould we consider these refunds for verkle gas costs too? If yes that means keeping these SSTORE_*_GAS constants. My guess is that there are no refunds in verkle, is that correct?",
