        "content": "The stem `5b5fdfedd6a0e932da408ac7d772a36513d1eee9b9926e52620c43a433aad7` corresponds to the account `0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe`, which is related to the [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935). (The `0x3fe165c03e7a77d1e3759362ebeeb16fd964cb411ce11fbe35c7032fab5b9a8a` is the hash of block 0, so this also matches).\n\nI believe that the `VERSION`, `BALANCE`, `NONCE` and `CODE_HASH` were updated/initialized, but they weren't added to the witness. Alternative is that they were initialized in the state by mistake (e.g. side-effect of calculating the trie key for the hash of block 0).\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, there were some changes to the EIP-2935 since the last devnet. So this is something to look into/keep in mind for the devnet-7.",
