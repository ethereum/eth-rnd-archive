I mention this in a particular section (https://hackmd.io/@jsign/geth-mpt-analysis#What%E2%80%99s-the-approach-for-these-results), quoting: \"The state tree was walked depth-first search, collecting information when touching leaves. If the leaf was an SC, the underlying Storage Trie was walked DFS.\". So TL;DR ~depth-first search; considering the key mapping is done with a collision resistant hash function, could be considered that accounts are walked randomly.\n2. In general, a \"trie\" tries to shorten branches compares to a \"tree\" if there're chunks of the key that are the same for all children. For example, say the key is 10 bytes, and you have a tree (i.e: not a trie) where each internal node is 1 byte of the key. If in that tree you have a children that doesn't share any part of the key with other children, you'll be storing 10 nodes in the tree ~\"for no good reason\". The idea of extension nodes in tries is to compact shared chunks of branch keys in a single node (extension node).",
