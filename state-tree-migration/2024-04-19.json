I just wrote a high level article or my progress so far:\nhttps://ethresear.ch/t/portal-network-verkle/19339\n\nIf possible, I would like to discuss it briefly at the upcoming call on Monday. Basically to answer questions, and receive feedback and suggestions",

        "content": "I think that blake2s would be a good candidate hash function here - we anticipate ~20k hashes/s performance for the plonky3 proving system. It also has the advantage that it doesn't impose a performance penalty on zk-proving L1 blocks on certain performant proving systems, unlike Verkle trees, which are tied to a particular finite field.",
