        "content": "hi Guys, as discussed in the call if you want to spin up a local lodestar\u003c\u003egeth node you can clone this repo : https://github.com/blockblaz/spindevnets/tree/atgenesis  , branch `atgenesis` which configures the `electra/prague` (verkle) to run at genesis and run following scenarios:\n\n1. Run lodestar\u003c\u003egeth single node - `NETWORK_DIR=kaustinen $REPO_PATH/./spin-node.sh`\n     (it also plays 2 simple eth transfer transactions)\n\n2. you can also up a pure syncing peer again with lodestar\u003c\u003egeth combination by running in a new terminal: `NETWORK_DIR=kaustinen MULTIPEER=syncpeer $REPO_PATH/./spin-node.sh`\n\nThe script pull the target images from docker and spins it up so that you get you going in the fastest manner possible.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\na) Important things to note: `genesis.json` is in the kaustinen dir\nb) lodestar generates and writes its `dev` genesis in the folder where you are running from so that the other CLs can pick genesis from there while trying to sync against this single node network\nc) its possible to also plug in your dev and testing by specifying full path than docker images in `kaustinen/env.vars`\nd) right now it supports `geth` and `lodestar` but i will add `nethermind` and `lighthouse` to it as well.\ne) you can also run the system in two node configuration : `lodestar\u003c\u003egeth` as peer1 which gets half the validators (`NETWORK_DIR=kaustinen MULTIPEER=peer1 $REPO_PATH/./spin-node.sh`) and another node with rest half (`NETWORK_DIR=kaustinen MULTIPEER=peer2 $REPO_PATH/./spin-node.sh`) - this can allow you to test proposals against the `lodestar\u003c\u003egeth` (and you can always run the sync peer as well)\nf)potentially all clients can be supported, so let me know who wants to use this utility and I can get it going (with your help)",
