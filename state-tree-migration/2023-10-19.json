Like how is it setup and what information is currently sent around?\nFor example:\n- Is it a fork from the mainnet and at what block, or is it brand new blockchain?\n- If it is a fork, how does it do the transition? I read few documents on this, but I'm not sure what was decided approach.\n- When new block is built and propagated, do other nodes need to have entire state or can they verify new block just with the data in it (meaning, is data required for execution and proof sent with the new block)?",
