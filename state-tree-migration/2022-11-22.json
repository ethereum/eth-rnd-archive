        "content": "Question:\nReading https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip#Tree-embedding, in particular `MAIN_STORAGE_OFFSET` being `256**31`.\nIs it worth adding to the EIP as a further clarification apart from the existing `Additionally, MAIN_STORAGE_OFFSET must be a power of VERKLE_NODE_WIDTH.`, that `MAIN_STORAGE_OFFSET` should be less than: `256*2^252 - 256^32`? (Or more generally `VERKLE_NODE_WITH * ScalarFieldSize - 256^32`)\n\nI think that `256**31` value is coming from a safe value to avoid `(MAIN_STORAGE_OFFSET + storage_key) // VERKLE_NODE_WIDTH` potentially \"wrapping around\" the field? (potentially writing header values or other reserved fields, which would be really bad)\nIs that the case?",
