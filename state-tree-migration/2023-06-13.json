I’d also recommend joining the monthly Verkle Implementers Call to learn more.",

I made https://github.com/gballet/verkle-block-explorer last year but it's very bare bones, and ideally we would like to tweak a real block explorer, i.e. adapt one of the existing ones. Nonetheless, this codebase has some really useful features, like the part that takes the proof, reconstructs the tree from it, and generates an image from it.",
