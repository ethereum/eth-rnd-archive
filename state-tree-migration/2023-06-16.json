You don't actually \"set\" that case, it's the default value (i.e: never touched).\nThe first time you touch that value, you set the marker bit forever... so no matter what future values you set there (i.e: even zero) you can always detect that this value was touched.\n\n(Small note reg your example: the bits should be counted from the least significant bit to the most significant bit)",
