        "content": "Since we are currently focussed on scalling and repricing things (as part of Glamsterdam), is it considered risky/problematic to migrate fixed amount of items during transition from MPT to binary trie (my understanding is that this is the current plan)?\n\nCan we do it dynamically, something like this:\n`itemsToMigrate = (gasLimit - gasUser)/GAS_PER_MIGRATION_ITEM`\n\nI think this would work well with the proposal from Monday's call to use system contract to keep track of trie migration progress.\nOn the other hand, it might not work so nicely with some strategies that were considered for distribution of preimages (since we don't know upfront how many items will be migrated per block).",
