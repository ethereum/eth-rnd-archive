Shouldnt it be same as the suffix is the only difference, like key1p? Or am I misunderstanding something 😅",

The `80` suffix (remember is hex) is 129, so it leaves in C2 and not in C1 like the other two mentioend values. \nI think you were thinking if they live in the same \"leaf commitment\", which the answer is yes. But that code is referencing the C1 and C2 at the leaf node level.\nlmk if makes sense now",

There's a part in the article that mentions that in bold IIRC; so you shouldn't be thinking much about that.\n\n\u003e  in the left diagram why is the arrow shown from C(0,4), shouldnt it be from C(0,0)\nYes.. I remember now this was something that I also thought was a mistake when I first read the article. I don't remember if was planned to be fixed...\nIn any case, I agree that that arrow origin should be C(0, 0).",
