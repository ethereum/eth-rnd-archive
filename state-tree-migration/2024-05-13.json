        "content": "This is a diagram I drew based on the implementation of rust-verkle. My understand that the stem node is designed to reduce the height of the tree. But if Leaf nodes 2 and 4, or 3 and 4 appear at the same time, it will not play a role in reducing the depth, and it is a possible attack surface. And you don’t need to have the private key of the relevant address to attack. For example, I directly transfer a very small amount of ether as a balance to the account represented by Leaf nodes 2 and 4, which can deepen the depth of the Verkle Tree.",
