        "content": "Hello everyone. I am a prospective PhD student and currently doing research on ETH storage reformation for gas saving. Now I am struggling to find the “most official” or “highest potential to be applied in further upgrades” implementation of Verkle Tree scheme. According to eip-6800, it seems to be a single-layer tree eventually? Whereas the codes inside eip-6800 describe a milti-layer Verkle Tree with branch width 256. I am confused which one is the preferred option? (or in fact eip-6800 is already discarded?)",

        "content": "I have one question regarding how L2s (to be specific zkEVM type1) will work with verkle trie data structure:\n\n- To my knowledge their goal is to recreate the same trie struct and \"prove\" that \"edit\" of the trie is done correctly, so having `state_root_1` and applying many (sparse) pedersen MSMs in the trie and proving that `state_root_2` is calculated correctly. Does this leave some space for additional optimization/aggregation of proving multiple same/similar MSMs? For example IPA multiproof proves and aggregates proofs for similar thing for verkle on L1 (membership proof) but here it's a bit different?",
