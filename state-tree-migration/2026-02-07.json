For context, I previously implemented a binary trie in Scroll's reth fork (since deprecated as we migrated to native Ethereum MPT). Would appreciate pointers to current specs, research docs, and any client implementations to look at. Thanks!\n\nreference: https://github.com/scroll-tech/reth/tree/scroll/crates/scroll/trie",
