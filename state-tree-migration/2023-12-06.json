        "content": "Hey, sharing some (hopefully) useful info for VKT crypto libraries maintainers.\n\nI’ve finished writing all planned test vectors here: https://hackmd.io/@jsign/verkle-test-vectors#Cryptography-test-vectors [that doc also lists some non-crypto related tests vectors, but those will probably come next month -- which can be more relevant for client core-devs]\n\nThese crypto test vectors try to cover many angles of things that can go wrong in implementations, so I wanted to at least help all libraries consider them to include in their test.\nYou can see the test vectors here: https://github.com/jsign/verkle-test-vectors/tree/main/crypto\n\nIt also includes a “test runner” that tests all this in `go-ipa`, so you can also look there if you have further questions about particular tests and how they’re run. [Not sure `go-ipa` runner will live in that repo instead of moving it to the repo itself, but thought can help other libraries for a while to find it in the same repo].\nOf course, if you find something odd, it can be that you simply have a mistake, the test vectors are incorrect or ambiguous, or a bug in `go-ipa`. If there’s something odd, send me a DM.\n\nAs next steps probably we’ll include these tests in the Rust (me/\u003c@427491045308235776\u003e ) impl, but also suggest other libraries like ones written in Nim (cc \u003c@570268431522201601\u003e , FYI!), Zig (me?) to consider them.\n(PD: for now these are ad-hoc test vectors out of the usual testing infra — in the future we can include them in more official repos and/or spec if their format and scope make sense)",
