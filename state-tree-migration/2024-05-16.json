Can somebody answer following questions:\n\n- Which of the `VERSION`, `BALANCE`, `NONCE`, `CODE_KECCAK` and `CODE_SIZE` are always set for EOA and which one for Smart Contracts (assuming they are default values)?\n- Is there a way to export all key/value pairs that are set during genesis creation from geth or some other implementation?",
