I can introduce more about storage trie inside pse-zkevm and scroll-zkevm.    Pse-zkevm is trying to implement the current MPT of eth in halo2  https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits/pull/398 while Scroll implements a poseidon trie.  https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/v0.4/spec/mpt-proof.md .   Verkle trie circuit will be much more efficient compared to current MPT, it is almost just some IPA multi open verification (even though there is some wrong field computation).     Btw, if anybody is interested in implement verkle trie circuit (any constrain system), you can contract me, Scroll can set up a grant for that.   (I am the zkevm circuit lead of Scroll).",
