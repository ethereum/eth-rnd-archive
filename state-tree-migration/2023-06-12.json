Every vector commitment that is also additively linear (i.e. two commitments can be added together and form a new commitment for the elementwise sum) can be turned into a polynomial commitment using IPAs (Inner Product Arguments)\n\nWe started out by trying to use KZG as our vector commitment, but it turned out simpler Pedersen commitments are a lot faster and more suitable to our usecase",
