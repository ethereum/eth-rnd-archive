        "content": "my bad, indeed it was not mentioned in the text of that EIP, although it was certainly already considered at the time. It is for sure being mentioned here: https://notes.ethereum.org/@parithosh/verkle-transition#%E2%80%9COverlay%E2%80%9D-live-conversion-method \n\n\u003e Then block execution proceeds as normal, with the following tweaks to the tree update algorithm:\n\u003e \n\u003e  1. Reads from a location right of the conversion boundary: These reads are performed from the overlay tree.\n\u003e  2. Reads from a location left of the conversion boundary:\n\u003e      * Look for the key in the overlay tree. If a value is found, return it;\n\u003e      * Otherwise, check if the key is left of the conversion boundary. If so, return a missing value.\n\u003e      * Else, look for the key in the MPT. If a value is found, convert the key and insert it in the overlay tree, then return the value.\n\nThe difference with what is written in this doc, is that indeed the MPT would be updated for writes. Which suffers from the same flaw as what is described in the EIP: now two sync need to work in parallel.",
