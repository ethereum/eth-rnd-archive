        "content": "Hi,\n\nThanks for the PR. Currently if changes are made to the repo and pushed, it will compile and re-deploy the website, can you modify the CI workflow to do this for docusaurus?\n\nRE the HackMd's, it would be good to have that information there, I'll revisit issue #2 re structure of the website (not 100% satisfied with it) and we can add them in a separate PR. Feel free to opine on what you think would make a good structure for those who have no experience with verkle tries, even broadly. \n\nWe can start off by looking at the ethereum.org docs here : \u003chttps://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/\u003e to see what categories are included and the structure that was chosen (It may or may not be suitable for us)",
