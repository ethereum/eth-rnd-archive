        "content": "(discussed these questions on the VIC today. Re-sharing here for those not on the call) \n\n1. Migration path is ~90% decided. Current idea is to use the \"overlay method\". Guillaume/Ignacio have a working poc. And other teams are starting on their own implementations. See this doc for a summary of the potential methods: https://notes.ethereum.org/@parithosh/verkle-transition\n\n2. How to get Verkle proofs: other than just syncing, Guillaume mentioned we could potentially tweak the explorer to save and provide the proofs. And maybe allow downloading the witness bytes, or anything else that's interesting. (note: Dora is currently down, so cant check atm. but normally see https://dora.verkle-gen-devnet-5.ethpandaops.io ) \n\n3. Run stateless client: Milos to reach out to Gajinder. Will see if we can get some notes shared for others interested 🙂",
