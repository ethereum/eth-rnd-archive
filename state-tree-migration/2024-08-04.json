        "content": "In https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests there's a dedicated branch for `verkle/main`. Today it has generic state conversion test. Then in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/659 I'm working on 6800, 4762 and 7709.\nToday we haven't shared any fixtures to run since we're currently working with \u003c@755913785620824175\u003e on this since Verkle requires many changes both in the testing framework and also in t8n-env for filling. Quite soon we'll finish with some remaining tasks and we'll share a first set of fixtures ready to be used by clients. Our goal is to have as many fixtures as possible ready before the next devnet launch.",
