Shouldn't we primarily look for purely hash-based alternatives? (or at least quantum-safe)\n\nI think my answer to this is, stateless-to-stateless transition is significantly easier than stateful-to-stateless, and the verkle transition includes some key one-time changes (esp around gas costs), and those two facts together mean that, with the verkle tree transition done, the total complexity of a transition to ideal STARK-friendly binary merkle trees drops by ~4x",
