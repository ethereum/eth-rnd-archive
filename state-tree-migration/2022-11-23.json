Then I tried to optimize it using the montgomery form that is used in golang implementation, but after that the polynomial and proof calculations are having some issues, would you be able to help me with that? I just need to know what changes should be made there to adjust for the montgomery form.\nhttps://github.com/NethermindEth/bandersnatch-sharp/tree/main/src/Bandersnatch/Nethermind.Verkle.Polynomial",
