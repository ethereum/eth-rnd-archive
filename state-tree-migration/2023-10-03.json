        "content": "regarding the discussion on the docs and the EIP: https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_tree_eip \n\n1. it's referring to bandersnatch, shouldn't it be banderwagon?:\n```\n        o = bandersnatch.add(o, bandersnatch.mul(generator, child))\n```\nIt's a simple thing, but people get confused with the details.\n\n2. There are no mentions of IPA, multiproof, etc, this is more on Dankrad's blog and Kev's hackmd.\n\n3. There are comments from Gottfried like:\n```\nAs defined, extension_and_suffix_tree return a Point, not an int, so type-hinting is wrong or a group_to_field is missing.\n```\nthese are just some examples\nSo this also makes things confusing for developers implementing verkle tries. I've been in contact with 4-5 people involved in this as newcomers, so that's my conclusion. Not saying there are no clear specs(in 15 different places), but this confusion makes us take more time understanding what's actually needed\n\n\nSo just wrote the first few things that came to my mind, probably there are more ways to improve docs. cc \u003c@1010280066028142662\u003e",
