        "content": "From running time perspective, Keccak is the bottleneck. (Btw the complexity of mpt itself can be seen as \"development bottleneck\", it means it costs many person-month to replicate mpt inside circuit.  We know there are several node types of mpt, leaf node extension node, rlp encoding/dynamic length etc. Mean while, implementing verkle trie will be simpler). From our previous estimation, compared to verkle trie circuit, mpt circuit will be at least dozen times of expensiveness. PSE team is working on that ( a type 1 light client: https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits/issues/1543).   Let me find whether PSE team has a discord or telegram group so you can join and ask them for more details.",
