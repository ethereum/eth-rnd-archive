        "content": "One of the hard parts of dealing with the ethereum state (somewhat in a Portal context) is that it's always shifting/changing....  every new block... the proofs change somewhat significantly with new state roots.  I've been toying with a different mental model which I'm curious whether it could even be viable.\n\n- Only calculate state roots every N blocks (N=256? 1024? unclear) call these \"epochs\"\n- In between epochs, we simply accumulate diffs in some kind of double batched accumulator.\n- The \"state commitment\" is then the combination of the most recent state root + the current set of state diffs.\n\nIf this scheme could work, I think it unlocks some nice features.  The main one that I'm looking at is for archival nodes.  The diffs being commmitted to in-protocol makes it easier to do densely packed distributed storage of archival state data.  Maybe there are some other benefits to this as well, such as not having to do \"expensive\" trie calculations at every block and being able to batch a bunch of updates together at epoch boundaries.\n\nAnyone know if there's prior work on this topic somewhere?",
