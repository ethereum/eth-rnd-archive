When you have time, can you pull the go-ipa branch `kw/gnark-merge-dep` and see if there are significant differences?\n\nI sort of circumvented the need to check for release updates by pulling in gnark as a dep and having a wrapper package, so we just need to update the gnark-crypto dep, assuming they update goff code when they push an update",
