This is just the skeleton, what I need from you, if you are so kind, is to comment anything you feel is missing or any idea to improve it. Thank you so much. \n\nhttps://github.com/JEAlfonsoP/Verkle-Tree-and-Stateless-in-Ethereum-101",

There is a WIP website there to hold Verkle information for people, the repo needs some help, but if you could contribute some of what you have so far there that could be helpful",
