        "content": "trying to do a small write-up on stateless.  one of the things that it appears we get from verkle tries is straight forward gas metering for total witness size.  My understanding is that this side-steps a difficulty that was present if we were to try to do this with the hexary patricia trie.  That difficulty is that it would require some deeper level of trie/database awareness under the hexary patricia trie model since proofs are a bit messier, involving some unknown number of sibling merkle trie nodes for each access, resulting in the gas schedule being harder to predict and reason about.  Does this sound correct?",
