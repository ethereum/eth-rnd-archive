Since I could not find a paper on this, I want to \n* give an introduction to statelessness in ETH and Verkle trees\n* present implications and opportunities of the change\n* address current issues/challenges and point towards future research\n* contribute benchmarks/implementations if there is time at the end\n\nDo you see value in this work or have propositions for improval? Would love to get some feedback on this 🙂",
