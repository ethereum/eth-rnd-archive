They both rely on their respective cryptographic libraries, if you also plan to make changes to the cryptography.\n\nThere is also verkle_trie_eip in ethereum/research. Rust-verkle is interoperable with this proof of concept.\n\nI am not sure if condrieu needs more testing nodes though note, condrieu is ran with only go-verkle nodes at the moment, there is an interoperability issue between rust-verkle and go-verkle, as go-verkle applies an optimisation that changes the proof format. See \u003chttps://github.com/crate-crypto/rust-verkle/issues/50\u003e\n\nYou may also be able to contribute to what will soon be the reference implementation here: \u003chttps://github.com/crate-crypto/verkle-trie-ref\u003e This is much slower and does not apply any unreadable optimisations, I'm currently adding the relevant code for IPA, so its still incomplete",
