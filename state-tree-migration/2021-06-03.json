If C is a commitment to a vector v, and v' is an updated vector where some of the elements of v are changed, I presume it is possible to compute an updated commitment C' of v', just by knowing C and the old and new values of the updated elements? And this property is necessary for making witness size much smaller for Verkle tries than for Merkle tries, right?",
