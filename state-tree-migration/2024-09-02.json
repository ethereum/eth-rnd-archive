This gives a nice overview, but I'm still confused with the term \"verifying verkle trie\" in the context of \"zkevm\" or L2s. **I don't think zkEVM(L2s) need a (verkle)verifier algorithm.** Still, they only need to prove that \"edit\" of the trie is done correctly, meaning they need to compute a new state root in the \"zk\", so the only bottleneck is how many Pedersen hashes you need to do in the block to get new state root. Regarding verifying verkle proof (or verifying execution witnesses are part of the \"old\" state root), that can be done without \"zk\" but natively verify that execution witnesses are canonical to the (old)state root. Then use these witnesses for the execution, and prove (in \"zk\") that the execution is done properly, and the new state root is computed properly (meaning, editing of the trie is done properly).\n\nMaybe I'm wrong on this, but that's my understanding",
