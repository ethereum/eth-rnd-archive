        "content": "The *rough* model that I have for stateless block production is:\n\n- transaction level access lists\n- gossip protocol includes proofs for transaction validity (but proofs are not necessarily part of the transaction, just gossiped alongside).  At present these proofs would just be against the account `nonce/balance`.  Account abstraction makes this more complex....\n- multiple avenues for actual transaction witnesses to reach miners:\n    - sender can provide witness\n    - direct payment to a stateful miner to provide a witness (maybe as a new tx type)\n- miners primarily act as aggregators of transaction level witnesses, maybe optionally providing additional witness data themselves if they *want* to.  They take the tx level witnesses and aggregate them into a single de-duplicated block level witness (and block level access list).  These witnesses are gossiped and maybe committed to in some way at the consensus protocol level\n\nThere's lots of problems hiding inside of this that will need to be figured out, primarily how we update the transaction sending and gossiping protocols to support the various different ways that a transaction might make its way into a block and ensuring that there is a viable route for each transaction to acquire a witness prior to being included in a block.",
