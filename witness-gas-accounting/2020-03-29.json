It has been one of the weaknesses of both Bitcoin (in lesser extent) and Ethereum that it is quite hard to do proper accounting (because in order to understand how much Eth has come into an account and from where, and why - one needs re-tracing with quite a lot of intelligence built in). That goes against \"ETH is money\" narrative. Because good money should be easy to count 🙂",
