        "content": "Hello, are there implementations of Pedersen commitments to an elliptic curve with the following properties:\n- They are very fast, say Ristretto or similar. \n- The scalar field is F_q with q = p^r and p is small, I only need p to be at least 8 bits or so, r needs to be large enough so that it's computationally hard to find collisions for the commitments. \n\nRistretto works with q=p having 255bits, are there better options?",
