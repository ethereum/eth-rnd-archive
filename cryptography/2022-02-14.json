I think a machine that is capable can be built for \u003c5,000$, proof of concept to be implemented. According to conversations with Dag Arne Osvik, it’s likely possible to do this on a GPU much cheaper\n\nHow many (multi) scalar multiplication / (multi) pairings is that? I'm trying to get the sense of the optimizations I would need to do to get into that ballpark with my lib.",
