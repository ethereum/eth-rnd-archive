        "content": "According to the msm recent benchmarks it looks that in case we check the  subgroup (which means we can use the endomorphism acceleration) we lose all the benefits of using the endomorphism speedup. The algorithm becomes linear. It looks even much worse for many points which I assume is the most important case for ZK.  Even gnark with subgroup check looks very bad. W/o the check it's much faster than blst.",
