Another question regarding ECDSA implementation for ethereum; have noticed that 2 \"opposite\" signatures are valid for the same (msg hash, privKey). k representing the random nonce, both following signatures seem to be valid:\nSignature1:\n    k1\n    r1\n    s1\n    parity1\nSignature2:\n    k2 = -k1\n    r2 = r1\n    s2 = -s1\n    parity2 = !parity1\nIs there a criteria to favor one over the other, or are they both considered canonical/valid?",
