As a reminder, this is an issue specifically with Silkpre, do you want me to just open a public issue on the Silkpre repo? (or silkworm you said previously?) Might make sense to point out the potential issue in a DM so it's not publicly disclosed until fixed (or you agree I can open the public issue anyway)",
