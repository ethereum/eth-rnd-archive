Yeah if your x and y do not fit in a single scalar register then perhaps there are smarter ways than performing the full division. I don't have a clue, will think if no one comes here with a reasonable answer, my first intuition would be  perhaps computing p=\\phi(y) and replacing x=2^k by dividing k=p q + r and now your problem is computing 2^r % y which is surely scalar.",
