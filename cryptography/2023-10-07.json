        "content": "Yeah, I think the reason for using XOR is the same as that of a one-time pad. But in my understanding, the RANDAO value and each value taken by XOR need to be (1) deterministic, (2) uniformly distributed, and (3) unpredictable (for those who do not know the private key). VRF satisfies these three conditions, but I have not been able to find any literature proving (3) for the  BLS signature + hash.",
