There is an on-chain verifier that has the root/hash (or whatever it is called) of the contract so either Alice, Bob, Carol is capable of generating a proof, but no one else is because they don't have the code.  Lets further assume that Alice, Bob, and Carol all have individual secrets (e.g., private keys).",

Bonus points if the party who leaked the code can be proven on-chain so they could be punished in some kind of staking game.",
