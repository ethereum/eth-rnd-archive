Otherwise 100k USD saved on audits of the  precompile implementation in a client will lead to millions of potential losses by end users due to inefficiencies. My second largest concern is how to compare a complexity of a theoretical optimizing compiler for evm384 based implementation against the complexity of the cryptographic library written in an “older” language?",
