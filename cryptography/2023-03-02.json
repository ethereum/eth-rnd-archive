I used basic exponentiation for compute a field element inversion. Now looking for improvements because it takes ~90% of total time.  I've checked libff uses extended GCD algorithm. There is also option to generate \"addchain\" with ~300 multiplications. Any recommendations what to choose?\n\ncc \u003c@427903869226582018\u003e",
