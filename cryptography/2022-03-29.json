I have been working on an article exploring Program-Obfuscation in context of existing primitives and Ethereum with the research team at Mycelium to present a concentrated resource and alternative ways to conceive such a system. \n\nAs Ethereum gradually begins to move beyond solving the Zero-Knowledge space it will become increasingly likely that further effort will be concentrated towards Program-Obfuscation. I believe having this resource and others will serve as an important foundation for this next stage. \n\nIf anyone is interested in providing feedback or contributing to further developments in this field, please feel free to reach out.\n\nhttps://mycelium.xyz/research/obfuscation-and-verification-of-functions/",
