The size of the elliptic curve group (i.e. the number of points on the relevant (sub-)group) and its 2-adicity is not relevant.\nHaving p = 3 mod 4 means that the 2-adicity is very low and there is no potential for further acceleration of square roots; it's already sqrt-friendly.\nFor BLS12-381, you indeed have p=3 mod 4, meaning essentially no 2-adicity for the field of definition. It's the size of the elliptic curve subgroup that has high 2-adicity, but that doesn't harm here.\n\nFor Bandersnatch, the size of the field of definition is chosen to be the size of BLS12-381's elliptic curve subgroup, which is why it matters a lot for Bandersnatch.",
