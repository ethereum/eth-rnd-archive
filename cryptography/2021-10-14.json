So I'm not sure if you are after a PoC or an actual optimized implementation, but in principle you can interpolate a polynomial passing through any 256 points and you can use that scheme.",

This way might be faster to get going because dividing on the domain is replaced with polynomial division which you can copy and paste from some repo, and IFFT is also something that I think can be copy and pasted",
