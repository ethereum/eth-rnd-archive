I want to verify if my understanding is correct:\n\nIf a blob tx header is validly-formed (number of commitment hashes in `blob_versioned_hashes` is in the range of the blob count that the chain is willing to accept at the time), we cannot definitively say that the given tx header cannot correspond to a correct blob transaction regardless of what we receive in the sidecar, as the sidecar contents are not signed over (only the hashes of the commitments).",
