        "content": "Hi Micah. A quick question about EIP1559: does `signature_y_parity` = `0x00` means `R.y` is odd or `R.y` is even? It is confusing for me as it is typed `bool` in the EIP1559, so I would expect `0x00` means `false` a.k.a odd, but this seems to contradict the old `v` parameter meaning (`v = y % 2`).",
