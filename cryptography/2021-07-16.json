If the range of the domain verified is \u003e\u003e N, then it is not feasible to \"recreate\" a polynomial to satisfy a ZK-STARK.\n\nHowever, one problem has been bugging me - the prover is the one who creates the merkel tree that contains the values of the polynomial (`P(x)`) and the multiplier of Z(x) to get P(x) (`D(x)`). Since the values of Z(x) are public knowledge, instead of trying to create a polynomial, couldn't a crafty prover create a merkle tree where each value of `P(x)` is equal to each value of `Z(x)` and `D(x)` is always equal to 1? \n\nIf I need to explain my question in more detail, my DM's are open 😄",
