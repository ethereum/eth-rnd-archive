        "content": "That's an odd choice, `(0,0,0)` I guess is fine cause it's not even a point in the projective plane, but choosing a valid point in the plane which is not in the curve to represent another point in the plane is weird. As far as I know for elliptic curves in Weierstrass form people typically use homogeneous coordinates which would lead to `(0,1,0)` being at infinity, or Jacobian coordinates which would lead to `(1,1,0)`.",
