In other words, some of the individual signatures (belonging to the attacker) that make up an aggregate signature of some message M, can in fact be a valid signature of a different message M'.\n\nMy guess is that the message-binding property is not necessary for the security of BLS signatures in Ethereum, but I haven't seen a confirmation of this. Can anyone confirm if this is true?",
