(I’ve not been keeping up with that)\n\nIf not, there should be!\n\nZK-EVMs are at a level of maturity that L1 ZK-EVMs are on the horizon.\n\nAlso, there's the consideration that today ZK-EVM L2s are often using extremely ugly and centralizing tricks to put limits on how many hashes per block they support, and increasing gas costs is the obviously correct solution, but they're scared to give their devs gas costs inconsistent with the \"mainstream\". That problem alone could be solved by making this an RIP, but the fact that we also want to prove L1 makes it worth doing as an EIP as well.\n\nI'm happy to adjust exact values based on benchmarking results.",
