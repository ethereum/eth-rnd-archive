At least I didn't see bindings from the assembly/C/Rust implementations. \n\nIncidentally, what is the implementation of Ristretto that I should be using? I see there's https://github.com/gtank/ristretto255  and there's https://github.com/bwesterb/go-ristretto where you yourself added code. This latter library does not have an explicit MSM implementation it seems and you need to loop, while the previous library relies on https://github.com/FiloSottile/edwards25519 which does have a variable time MSM it seems.",
