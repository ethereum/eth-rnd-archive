I actually check if it is at infinity while it is a Jacobian point.  It appears I do thisk because it is necessary when converting a jacobian point to an affine point, so I *can't* convert first then check.",

If you give me a point of the projective plane that is not on this line, and therefore is in the affine plane, then it is trivial as you say to find the affine coordinates. But the identity element is not in the afffine plane so you can't express it in affine coordinates.",
