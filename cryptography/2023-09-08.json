        "content": "Hi Pawel, it is typically easy to find the two torsion of an elliptic curve, the property that P + P = O is the property that P = -P. Depending the parametrization you have in your curve, computing -P is very simple. In the typical examples that are used in Ethereum for a point P = (x,y) the parametrization of -P is (x, -y), so you are looking to finding points P such that y = 0, which now becomes a polynomial equation in x. But keep in mind that there are elliptic curves without any torsion, see for example \u003chttps://mathoverflow.net/a/95122\u003e, but these are defined over Q which is not what is used in cryptography AFAIK",
