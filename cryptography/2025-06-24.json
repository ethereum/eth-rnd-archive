Specifically that R' is not infinity and r' ≡ r mod n  \n\nit is circuitious to track down, but I believe that openssl's verification function is https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/ec/ecdsa_ossl.c#L444\n\nI believe this is implicitly checking that R'  is not at infinity https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/ec/ecdsa_ossl.c#L536-L539\n\nand this is verifying r' ≡ r mod n    (not just r' = r)\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/ec/ecdsa_ossl.c#L541-L544\n\ncan I get a cryptographer to double check this for me?  Otherwise if we have to do these checks explicity, we will either have to write our own verify function or take the time to re-recover R'.\n\nSame question for boringssl, but I haven't delved into its verify code yet.",
