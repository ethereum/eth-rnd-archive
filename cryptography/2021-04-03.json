The shares themselves would be valid mnemonic words because of the maping. Shamir secret sharing has information information theoretic security meaning it doesn't matter the size of the field you are working with, your only worry is that the secret fits in the field (assume the threshold for reconstruction is 2, the polynomial would be a line, if an attacker has one point he learns nothing about the line that passes through this point because you can pass infinitely many.  Think of one time pad: the size of the key doesn't matter, what matters is that the key has the same size of the message). Here is an example in python3: https://replit.com/@nicolas3355/BIP-39-secret-sharing#main.py",
