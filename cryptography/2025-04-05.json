        "content": "Here is the prototype EVMMAX-like implementation of the modexp precompile up to 8k bits. There are two challenges for the generic modexp implementation (as defined in the precompile):\n1.  EVMMAX can handle arbitrary moduli from a user, but you need to specify its size up front. So to handle arbitrary size, the program switches to different code paths for different sizes.\n2. EVMMAX only supports odd and power-of-two moduli. To handle even moduli the program splits it into two: odd and power-of-two ones, computes intermediate values for both and then combines them into the single result.\n\nIf you usecase is more constrained (e.g. odd moduli up to 1024 bits) the usage of the EVMMAX would be straight-forward. \n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/evmone/pull/1135",
