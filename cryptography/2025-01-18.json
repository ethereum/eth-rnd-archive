I can't find a library that allows me to do this in an efficient way. Actually I can't find a library that allows me to do this in an innefficient way either. I need to cook up the mapping from say each chunk of `[31]byte` to some canonical way of getting a `[32]byte` slice that encodes a unique Scalar.  Since this is clearly an intended use for these libraries, I assume that it's me that's not understanding here.  I need this in Golang, and I'm looking into https://github.com/gtank/ristretto255/blob/master/scalar.go, did anyone here have some interaction with these paths? Perhaps you \u003c@427491045308235776\u003e that contributed to the other library?",
