If they’re late publishing the blobs the block with be orphaned. \nIf the blobs are available to other nodes via the EL mempool already the solo staker, having used their own local mempool to create the block, will very likely not be impacted by their upload bandwidth limits slowing down blob publication because the blobs are already widely available.",
