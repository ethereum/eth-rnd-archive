        "content": "One of the biggest benefits (in my opinion) of (a) getting it as rlp in the first place and (b) getting all of them at once is that you can check the validity of them really easily, before even rlp decoding. A light client (or other applications that doesn't fully trust its full node) would have to convert it to the consensus encoding first before they can be used for checking their integrity.\n\nIn addition to that: If I remember correctly, Go-Ethereum's GraphQL endpoint also gives them back in consensus encoding. Not sure about the other clients if they support GraphQL in the first place.",

Or maybe a new `raw` namespace?",
