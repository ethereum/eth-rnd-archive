While the blockHash property seems consistent (perhaps due to the details in EIP-234), the fromBlock and toBlock behavior is not, especially when they exceed the node's chain head.\nHere's a breakdown of the responses I've observed:\n- Geth: Returns an \"invalid block range\" error.\n- Erigon: Returns an empty array ([]).\n- Besu: Returns an empty array ([]).\n- Reth: Replaces the condition with the node's chain head. I've raised an issue about this, but it still creates a discrepancy with Geth.\nFurthermore, how clients handle cases where only toBlock or fromBlock is specified also varies significantly.\nIssue https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/issues/534 attempted to address a part of it but hasn't seen progress. I'm wondering if updating the API spec would be the best way to tackle this. How much is the specification considered the source of truth for parameter validation? In case of the issue 534, how can we describe the result of a filter with a fromBlock \u003e node's chain head from the spec ?\nAnd finally, I opened https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/693 to add blockHash into the Filter schema. Specifying the required fields could be a way to enforce consistent behavior (the fact that fromBlock and toBlock are optional leads to different behavior).",
