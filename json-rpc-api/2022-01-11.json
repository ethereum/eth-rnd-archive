I have walked through the list of JSON-RPC methods and came up with the same subset that is going to be deprecated be the merge.\n\nI think we should keep the part of the API that provides access to uncles untouched.

Right?\nSo would it be smart to at least note that the uncle endpoints will eventually be deprecated when Ethereum's state no longer contains any uncle blocks?\nOr should I just leave it out for now?",
