        "content": "I has been recently working on decoupling Shanghai Engine API spec from Paris and noticed that `forkchoiceUpdatedV2` returns error if `payloadAttributes.withdrawals == null` and withdrawals are activated. At the same time `newPayloadV2` returns `INVALID` in the same situation. I personally don't like this inconsistency, and I also against abusing `INVALID` payload status. I am curious what EL clients return if `transactions == null`; do they return error or `INVALID` payload status?\n\nMy preference is to return error in all cases when payload is malformed. I remember \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e and \u003c@755590043632140352\u003e opinion on that is different. cc \u003c@539495253418180618\u003e",
