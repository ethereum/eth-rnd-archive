I would like to know why `web3_methods` and `net_methods` are not included in the specs. I checked issues related to these two type of methods were closed  in 2021-05-19 by Alita Moore without explanation. Are these methods not standard APIs? But the docs in https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#json-rpc-methods list several `web3_` and `net_` methods. I would like to know the consideration here, thanks.",
