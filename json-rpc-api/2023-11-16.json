        "content": "we were discussing with \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e the possibility to move `payloadAttributes` validation to the end, after the fork choice state is applied. Like if any field is missing in the attributes the forkchoice state won't be reverted and the error in the response will be `Invalid payload attributes`, semantically it is \"I have applied the forkchoice state but the build process has not started because of bad attributes\"\n\n\u003e Revisiting my original concern in this PR, I think we can modify our behavior so that every field is optional, which will allow us to validate the payloadAttributes later in the flow (i.e. after the fc state is applied).\n\nthe above is the original comment by \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e, what do you think making it into the spec and implenting this logic in Besu?",
