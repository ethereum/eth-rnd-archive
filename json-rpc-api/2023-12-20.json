If set to false, then it follows `eth_call` semantics which (unfortunately) is different for each client, but generally the clients do relatively little validation and they just execute.  If `validation: true` then the intent is that clients will fully validate everything and follow all of the normal rules *except* a couple explicitly disabled ones (cannot-send-from-contract and signature-valid).  Does this sound like the same thing as what you are thinking of?",
