I was wondering if there was any interest in adding this to the official rpc api spec. from what I understand, this endpoint might not be practical for certain client implementations.\n\nfwiw go ethereum has something similar `GetModifiedAccountsByHash (/ByBlock)` which returns a list of addresses changed in a block (only returns data for the last 128 blocks)",
