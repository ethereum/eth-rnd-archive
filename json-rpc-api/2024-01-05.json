For example decoding the approve function of DAI I'm pretty sure this `memory[0x20:0x40] = 0x03;`is where its loading the slot value: https://ethervm.io/decompile/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#func_approve, you can see the same pattern in `balanceOf` which I'm pretty sure is using slot 2: https://ethervm.io/decompile/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#func_balanceOf (`memory[0x20:0x40] = 0x02;`)",
