Working on an EVM implementation and seem to be hitting this issue when testing with metamask - https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/5894\n\nIt shows fixed but I am clearly observing metamask calling estimateGas before I've entered a value... and a zero value transfer does use less gas than a non-zero transfer in my instance.",

        "content": "Somewhat related... in the case where this happens and the transaction fails due to out of gas, is there any way that the RPC is intended to tell metamask or other clients about the cause of an error (in my case I know exactly why as part of sendRawTransaction) so that it can display a meaningful error message to the user?  I looked at the JSON-RPC spec and did not see anything about errors, just `json-rpc-error-codes-improvement-proposal`",
