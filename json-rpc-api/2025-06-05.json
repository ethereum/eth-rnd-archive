Then you add a menu link to it in the config and it would showed up in the sidebar. \n\nI have PR up that I believe will fix it , probably land tomorrow 🙂 \nhttps://github.com/open-rpc/generator/pull/731\n\nFor more context, the OpenRPC team has been talking and we think we'll commit to doing a documentation generation overhaul to our upcoming roadmap for the year. \n\nWe are going to target having docusaurus as a base again and  styling to be more in line with something like https://mintlify.com  docs. \n\nIf you have any feedback or thoughts on things you'd like to see in that overhaul feel free to shoot me a DM 🙂",
