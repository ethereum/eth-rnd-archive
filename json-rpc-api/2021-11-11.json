Even though there does not exist any specification, it is at least implemented by geth,  Hyperledger Besu and Nethermind. Some libraries like web3j and web3.py support it as well.\n\nWhile it provides various information about the node, one important information the ENR (Ethereum Node Record) is missing. We at Hyperledger Besu were thinking about including it, to support tooling to retrieve it and have a common RPC call to it in general.\n\nOne potential use case would be to retrieve the ENR of a node and check if it is included in discv4-dns-lists of the EF.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to add a new endpoint. We were thinking to call it `admin_enrInfo`, to use a similar naming pattern.\n\nWhat do you think? Any feedback is welcome.\n\nGeth admin_nodeInfo: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-admin#admin_nodeinfo\nBesu admin_nodeInfo: https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/#admin_nodeinfo\nNethermind admin_nodeInfo: https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/ethereum-client/json-rpc/admin#admin_nodeinfo\nweb3j admin_nodeInfo: https://javadoc.io/doc/org.web3j/core/latest/org/web3j/protocol/core/methods/response/admin/AdminNodeInfo.html\nweb3.py admin_nodeInfo: https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/web3.admin.html#web3.admin.nodeInfo\n\nENR EIP: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778\n\ndiscv4-dns-lists: https://github.com/ethereum/discv4-dns-lists)",
