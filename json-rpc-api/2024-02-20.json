        "content": "Good point, that could also open up a few more ways for partial/smaller proofs.\nSlightly off-topic but related question: At the moment a light client requires the bloom in every receipt to be able to check validity of any receipt in the block. Are there plans to change that such that the bloom in individual receipts do not need to be sent to light clients? It's not a big deal, but those do add up and (my opinion) provide little benefit. For example: If I want to filter for some receipts I can do it using the block bloom to skip entire blocks, but I can't think of anything where we need the per-receipt bloom, as receiving and filtering on that is likely outweighs any benefit you could receive from skipping individual receipts based on the bloom (as we could just look at the logs that contain the information needed). This per-receipt bloom could be useful if the receipts are big and parsing the logs in them takes a while, but so far most I've seen most receipts are small and contain only a few logs.",
