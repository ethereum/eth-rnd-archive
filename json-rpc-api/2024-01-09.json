This was due to a comment on the spec someone made that `eth_multicall` name conflicted a bit with existing contracts on Ethereum mainnet, and we agreed that eth_simulate captures everything that this method does (which is more than just \"calls\").\n\nWe also talked about desire to get things finalized so we can start getting this into mainline clients and into Hive tests, but we want to lockdown the spec first (which means no more renaming the method and such 😬).\n\nAnd a bit of discussion around naming of base fee/gas price for 4844 transactions.",
