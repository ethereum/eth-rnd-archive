Hope you are doing well.\n\nI am learning about ethereum protocol right now, and currently I am trying to understand the way JSON-RPC is implemented, what API is exposed, and how it is wrapped with JS in `geth` in particular.\nI have been greping through the codebase, and I am trying to understand how are the namespaces like `admin, eth...` defined.\nI was also wondering if it is possible to read the documentation on the methods, to see the args that the methods expect, and their return values? Does it have some `help` method or `go doc`? Or is it only available on external resources?\n\nWhat i understood:\nFor now it seems that `geth` uses `web3.js` file as the root for env spawning and then appends objects compiled from go constants to the JSRE? Probably anyone of you also knows, what was the motivation behind such a decision, why not use `.js` files for each module? Cheers.",
