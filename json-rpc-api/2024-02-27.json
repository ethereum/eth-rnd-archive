That may be ok for something small - but if we are talking about a wallet that protects millions of dollars - having a clear text API key is not considered protection at all - you wouldn't secure your bank account API like that.\nSo you want something that is more robust... some sort of a JWT with additional protections inside it - like message hash, expiration time, nonce etc.",
