A few client teams have implemented/prototyped this, so I don't want the spec to be holding up a release.   We were going to use \"engine_getPayloadV2\" but that has been added to support withdrawals, so I'd like your input on the best way forward here.  It is ugly, but should we add \"engine_getPayloadWithFeeV1 (current payload + block value) and engine_getPayloadWithFeeV2 (capella payload + block value)\"?",
