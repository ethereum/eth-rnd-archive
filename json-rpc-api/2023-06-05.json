Currently, there is no reliable way to utilise the returned RPC error codes to uniquely identify an error and rather rely on the message descriptions returned, which vary very differently between implementations. Hence, applications that want to interoperate between these implementations must handle errors in a not-so-standard solution.\nJust asking around to get some feedback on the idea and the right approach to execute this. Appreciate any help. Thank you!!",
