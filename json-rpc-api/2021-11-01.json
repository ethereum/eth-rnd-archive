We're having some trouble figuring out the ultimate source of truth for the JSON-RPC specifications as there seems to be some methods missing between https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API and link to spec on https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis. Example being `getUncleBy` methods which has been addressed by \u003c@!543900561460822016\u003e here: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/issues/30. Any guidance on what we should be using?",

On the reverse case `eth_feeHistory` is not in the Wiki but in the `execution-apis`. \n\nSo if we follow this pattern. \n\n1. Use all the methods defined in the `execution-apis` repo \n2. Use additional methods defined in the Eth Wiki \n\nWill that cover the Eth JSON-RPC API completely? I want to limit our implementation point to a referable source.",
