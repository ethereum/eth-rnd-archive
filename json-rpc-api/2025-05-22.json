It was in better shape than the generator one , but is now behind the new 2.x.x version which is still gatsby but modern deps up and down. \n\nIf you stay on the open-rpc/generator package we'll be able to maintain it and add updates especially since the mono repo overhaul we did and ecosystem update.",
