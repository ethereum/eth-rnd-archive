This is not the first time that we get such report, and we've been discussing with the team how to best tackle this kind of issues.\nWe've created a ticket on the official JSON-RPC spec (https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/issues/463) to discuss this topic with the rest of the core devs and we would appreciate any input/suggestion.",
