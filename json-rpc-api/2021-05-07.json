I think the current format is overly verbose and will not be useful to by anyone other than maybe the engineers implementing the interface. I found there is a nice specification language OpenRPC for JSON-RPC services and there are already ethereum JSON-RPC specs written in it (both by the ETC Core team). I have opened a PR against the eth1.0-specs repo to use these specs. I've also updated them to add support for EIP-2718 and EIP-2730. Although the OpenRPC spec currently lacks the specificity that \u003c@!104006934562107392\u003e's work provides, we should be able to translate it into the description of the methods and types. This spec will be useful not only for coordination on the JSON-RPC standard, but non-core developers will also be able to easily view, use, and understand the spec. Here is a the web version: https://playground.open-rpc.org/?uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:splitView%5D=false\u0026schemaUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightclient/eth1.0-specs/4a2dbcaf90eedab7d966546b062bcf6f0f6220a9/json-rpc/spec.json",
