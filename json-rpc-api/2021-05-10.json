The other option is to open EIPs like we did for the block headers (e.g. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3041). It seems unlikely we'll have re-transcribed the entire spec as \u003c@!104006934562107392\u003e was starting in the next week or so, but that's the timeline where we'd need the 1559 diffs. \n\nI don't have a strong opinion on how we do it, but just want to highlight the two different timescales.",
