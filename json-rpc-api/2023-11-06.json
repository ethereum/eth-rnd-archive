Currently OpenRPC lacks the ability to write it clean without duplicating a huge number of lines for every error code / range. So I am reaching out to the Open RPC forum to check for the ability to add the feature to support ranges of error codes ( which it lacks currently, but there are open discussions already).\nIf incase I can amend the OpenRPC to allow the range definition for the Error codes, will that work?",
