For instance https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/eth/fee_market.yaml\n\n`eth_feeHistory` already has specs for blob transactions. However these are not yet on mainnet. How should we proceed implementing this? \"Just\" follow the spec and thus return 0s per the spec for the blob gas fee? Or should we omit these fields pre-fork?",
