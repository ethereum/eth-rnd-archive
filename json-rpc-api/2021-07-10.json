The link is to a new endpoint, returning information about fee history. There is also a change to behaviour of effectiveGasPrice:\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/commit/297e6b7c2c409e1dc7566304d1f10720f299c640#diff-c56024dc5c5982b3df8a0e683e2e340ff092b384030ce455e4a4b45239a43b81\n\nPlus, the base fee is a new value returned in the block header: which can be seen searching \"basefeepergas\" https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/json-rpc/spec.json",
