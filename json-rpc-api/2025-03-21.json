Recently in Nethermind we faced an [issue](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/issues/8316):\nwhen not specifying \"gasPrice\" in params then by default it is 20GWei in Nethermind which caused the above issue. In geth it is 0 by default. We are thinking while sending transactions we should default to something that eth_gasPrice returns, the most correct behaviour of eth_estimateGas would be something closer to real on chain current prices so eth_gasPrice. What do you think?",
