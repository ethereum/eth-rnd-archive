        "content": "I have some general ideas/comments regarding this RPC topic:\n\nI think the RPC is generally less conceived as critical, since it is not part of the (critical) protocol spec (like EVM changes). I would also not perceive this as critical firsthand, but when thinking about it I realized it is more critical than I would initially think. \n\nI think the post by Felix here https://notes.ethereum.org/@fjl/rpc-standards-2025-01 describes the situation very good and shows the relevance and the value of standardizing RPC.\n\nI think that the RPC is thus conceived as less critical than it is and should definitely get more love. Maybe a good start would be to start raising awareness that a standard and the compliance with this would be more than just a nice-to-have. This would prevent disasters in the future where two clients have slightly different implementations and it would also help if we would setup more trustless methods. It also helps a lot if we start now (and we should likely have started much earlier 🙂 ) on this by the points raised by Felix about L2 clients forking our software and thus duplicating the ideas we now have / we will get in the future.",
