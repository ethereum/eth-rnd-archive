        "content": "Hey, as type 4 transactions are being added. There's currently no way to simulate them without knowing the right signatures (which is impossible if you don't hold the right keys). Methods `eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`, `eth_simulateV1` and some tracing methods would need a way for that.\n\nWhat do you think about adding `authority` field to `authorizationList` elements as follows:\n```\n\"authorizationList\": [\n  {\n    \"chainId\": \"0x1a5887710\",\n    \"address\": \"0xb87f956451c68a700e5d70d8f3f6856cbf7614c5\",\n    \"nonce\": \"0x0\",\n    \"authority\": \"0x....\"\n  }\n]\n```\nIf you add this field, then you don't need to add fields `y_parity`, `r` and `s`, as that address would be used and the signature check is skipped. However if you add all:\n```\n\"authorizationList\": [\n  {\n    \"chainId\": \"0x1a5887710\",\n    \"address\": \"0xb87f956451c68a700e5d70d8f3f6856cbf7614c5\",\n    \"nonce\": \"0x0\",\n    \"authority\": \"0x....\",\n    \"r\": ...,\n    \"s\": ...,\n    \"y_parity\": ...\n  }\n]\n```\nThen I feel signature should be checked and compared to the authority field. If the authority fields address does not match, it should be an error",
