Currently it says:\n\n\u003e Returns the number of transactions sent from an address.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/eth/state.yaml#L36\n\nMy guess is all the ELs already just lookup the nonce rather than tracking an actual tx count, so maybe say something like:\n\n\u003e Returns the nonce of the account.  NOTE: The name getTransactionCount reflects the historical fact that before the Pectra fork nonce and sent transaction count were the same.\n\nWe can iterate on the wording, but if that sounds like a reasonable approach let me know and I'll open a PR.",
