        "content": "Hey all, regarding EIP-4844, right now in the spec there are `blobVersionedHashes`, `maxFeePerBlobGas` and `blobs` in GenericTransaction. I propose we remove `blobs` and proceed only with the hashes as per the discussion here. I have a PR to that effect in geth (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28786). This means concretely the following changes to the API:\n- `eth_sendTransaction` will fail if it notices a blob-related field. I.e. this will not be supported.\n- Sending EIP-4844 transactions will be only possible via `eth_sendRawTransaction`\n- `eth_signTransaction` can sign a blob-tx (actually I'm hesitant about this one)\n- `eth_call` can simulate a tx with blob hashes\n- `eth_estimateGas` blobs have no effect here\n- `eth_fillTransaction`, this method is not even specced. In my PR it can fill in `maxFeePerBlobGas` if user provided blob hashes",

        "content": "I recommend not adding blob transaction support to `eth_signTransaction` and instead we put it in the `wallet_signTransaction` namespace.  Same with `eth_sendTransaction`.  By not supporting blobs in those methods, it gives a bit of incentive for people to migrate to the `wallet_` namespace which is not managed/specced by the core devs.",
