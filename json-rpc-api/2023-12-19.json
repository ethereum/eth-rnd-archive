See for example Peter's description of the heuristics that geth makes (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23027#issue-916923366) where it assumes if `gasPrice` is added then the user is trying to determine if their tx is executable.\n\nWhile probably too late to change the behavior of `eth_call` perhaps `eth_multiCall` should be split into something like `eth_multiCallStatic` and `eth_multiCallExecutable` (horrible first pass names just to get the point across).",
