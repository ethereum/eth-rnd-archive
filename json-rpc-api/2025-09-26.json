The other issue is if your trying to build a history of delegations and their validity you're going to need an archive node (either using get code or transaction count).\n\nJumping through hoops to get the status of something that potentially changes the state of something just feels janky. \n\nThe status/validity should be on the transaction at the block and receipt level imo",
