The geth prestate tracer returns the accounts necessary to execute a transaction, however, it fails to include block hashes that are read during the execution of a transaction. This limits the tracer’s usefulness, as you are unable to reexecute a transaction if it includes the BLOCKHASH opcode.\n\nI’d like to suggest the inclusion of block hashes in an upgrade to the prestate tracer and am hoping to hear initial thoughts from node client devs.",
