Your argument that `eth_getTransactionByHash` is changing soon is also compelling, as that is another piece that I think we need to exercise in our \"example\".",

If so, much appreciated if you could send me a calendar invite (sam.richards@ethereum.org).\n\nQuick update on our end, we do have a PR up add the api docs to ethereum.org: https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pull/2352\nWe welcome input on this. If anything, the thought here is to provide a short term improvement over the current eth.wiki page.",
