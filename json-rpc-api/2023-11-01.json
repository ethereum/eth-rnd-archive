        "content": "Yes, you're right . The spec has point (4) which prescribes to proceed with the forkchoice state update only if `headBlockHash` references a `VALID` payload. So it implies that in the case when FCU: 6 -\u003e SYNCING the forkchoice state won't be updated.\n\n\u003e how does FCU on 5 \"reference an ancestor of the head of canonical chain\" ? isn't it just the current head of the canonical chain?\n\nYes it either the current head or a *descendant* of it (if only FCU 4 was fully processed before newPayload 6).\n\nConsidering the above, I would still make a clarification to the skip process and would add a test for this scenario if it doesn't exist. Though, now it seems this clarification is more informational than practical",
