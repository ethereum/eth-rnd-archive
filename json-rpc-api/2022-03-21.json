        "content": "Before we have crystallized `safe` and `unsafe` by adding them to the JSON-RPC spec and thus implementations (though we already have `safe` in Engine API but this is not the end yet), I would like to get back to the naming question once again. Are we happy in general with these terms?\n\nMy main concern is that `safe` is too abstract, for instance, `finalized` is safe too. Also, why would ethereum node serve an `unsafe` block to a user -- my concern from the other side. A bit of a background:\n- \"finalized\" block -- irreversible Casper FFG checkpoint, it has a set of assumptions\n- \"safe\" block -- irreversible block as per LMD-GHOST, it has another set of assumptions\n\n\"finalized\" is strongly associated with Casper FFG (as casper is a finality gadget), the main goal of this algorithm is to add finality property to the chain. It would be great to have something similar in the context of LMD-GHOST to just borrow it but we don't.\n\nWhat comes to my mind as an alternative to `safe`:\n- `reliable` -- the block is reliable in some context\n- `solid` -- as alternative to the above\n- `durable` -- the last word from ACID abbreviation\n\nAny other suggestion are very welcome.",
