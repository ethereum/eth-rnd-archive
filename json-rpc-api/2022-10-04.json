But `eth_syncing` seems under-specified; the `highestBlock` might not be known to be valid, and syncing execution layers are importing blocks without knowing if they are valid. In a Github discussion (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/25845#issuecomment-1259447646) \u003c@211091239112671234\u003e points out that an execution client doesn't have enough information to know whether it is actually behind anymore, and wants `eth_syncing` to refer to a subset of catching-up behaviors, distinguishing state sync from importing. I mostly want it to be the same API because of my own usage, but it would not be a problem for us if there was a separate `eth_behind` flag.\n\nIn the same vein, the execution layer seems to require some additional information from the consensus layer in order to be able to know whether it is behind. I think it can be accomplished by adding a block number to one of the `ForkChoiceUpdated` parameters. My preference would be for there to be a block number for each of `head`, `safe`, and `finalized`.",
