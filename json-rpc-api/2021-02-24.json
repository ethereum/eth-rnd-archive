        "content": "Carrying over the discussion from the call here, sounds like the earlier call proposed using `eth_call` as an example to write a spec for, our \"counter proposal\" is to write specs for `eth_getTransactionByHash` and `eth_blockNumber` for a couple reasons:\n\n- some `eth_call` implementations have extra params (e.g. geth's overrides) that are probably a bit too much to tackle for a first method.\n- edit: `eth_call`  returns a single `DATA` value or an error we might want practice returning more complex objects\n- `eth_getTransactionByHash` (and related tx RPCs) will be changing for Berlin and EIP-2718/-2930 so it'd be good to get clients in alignment on those changes sooner rather than later.\n- `eth_blockNumber` looks simple on the surface but introduces a lot of complexity how it responds when the node is fast syncing vs. archive syncing so might be a good example to help us determine what level of detail these specs should go into on expected behavior \n\nI'm definitely willing to help spend some cycles on the specs for these but would probably benefit from someone else starting the process since I need to come up to speed with OpenRPC.",
