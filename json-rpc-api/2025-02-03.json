Improvements to error code specs will be per-rpc-call and not universal across the entire suire of RPCs.\n\nDon't assert on error messages! If more precision is needed, specs may combine an error code with sub-codes for situations that require it, via a generic data field in the error response.\n\nTODO: collect list of libraries/frameworks/test suits that may be asserting on messages, and involve them in the process to adapt to the coming updated specs that will fix this.\n\nConventions- some situations are not errors, but rather vaguely defined conventions like returning null on an empty search, when an empty list could also be plausible. This likely warrants documentation, but current means of specifying it are sufficient.",
