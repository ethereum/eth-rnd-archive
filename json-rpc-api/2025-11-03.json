        "content": "Hello,\nI saw this EIP of luk just above and few others and I have difficulties to be clear about the naming for each stage of transactions lifecycle. For me there is 4 stages : \n- Pending : transaction is waiting in Transaction Pool\n- Included : transaction has been included in a block but not executed yet\n- Executed : The block has execute the transactions and receipts are available\n- Finalized : can't be subject to reorg\n\nIt seems that it's not this terms that are used because the EIP propose `transactionInclusion` but provide receipts so it correspond to \"Executed\" in my mind.\nIs there any ressources for the exact naming for each transaction lifecycle stage ?",
