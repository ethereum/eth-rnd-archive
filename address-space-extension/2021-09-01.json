Is this suggesting an encoding that targets 42 characters to stay inline with how long 20-byte addresses are in the `0x` hex format?  This seems like the opposite of what I would expect since we would want a clear way to differentiate between new/old.  Keeping them the same length seems to suggest some level of ambiguity in parsing.",
