        "content": "The performance could be improved in two areas: \n1. The state network full trie data structure requires many sequential network lookups in order to walk down the trie to get the state - This can be improved by using the flat trie structure so that we don't have to do as many lookups to fetch each leaf.\n2. The execution of a transaction is sequential and therefore lookups for different state leafs is done sequentially when it theory they could be fetched concurrently - Perhaps we can execute the transaction in memory without any state lookups, to collect the estimated/approximated touched addresses and slots, we then lookup these leafs concurrently then execute the actual transaction.",
