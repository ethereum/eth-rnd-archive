As far as I understand, if key size is 32 bytes and node width is 256, there will be 32 levels of the tree, now as there is no path compression like merkle patricia trie, witness for a single key should contain 32 commitments. Each commitment is a 2D point where each coordinate is 32 bytes. So 32 * 64 = 2048. Where did I calculated wrong ?",
