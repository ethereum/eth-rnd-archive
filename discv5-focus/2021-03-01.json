After reading the spec it seems well suited for a DiscV5 sub-protocol that could be used by other subprotocols to transfer data that exceeds the UDP packet size.  A rough sketch of how this would work is:\n\n- There is data that needs to be transferred that exceeds the UDP packet size.  A unique connection identifier is generated and sent so that both parties know it.\n- A new \"stream\" is opened on the `discv5-utp` subprotocol, loosely following the spec layed out in BEP29 using the connection identifier\n- The stream is used until it is closed...",
