        "content": "Hey all. \nAn increasing number of users are reporting a strange phenomenon. We find our external ip/port based on the majority of PONG responses we receive. \nWe're finding that pong responses are returning alternating ports. i.e A single node is receiving PONG's with portA and portB which is making it difficult to find the external ip/port. \nThis indicates that the router is sending outbound packets on two different ports, which is confusing. \n\nAnother theory, would be that an implementation is returning a different port other than the origin of the packet, maybe using the ENR or some other thing? Wondering if anyone else has seen this and/or if there may be anything strange in the PONG port responses in implementations?",
