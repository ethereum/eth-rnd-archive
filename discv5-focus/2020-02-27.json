Happy to add anyone who I may have missed, but want to keep it focused on just discv5.\n\n- Teku has been integrating dv5 work (https://github.com/PegaSysEng/discovery) from Harmony and working on simulations (https://github.com/zilm13/discv5)\n- Lodestar is looking into implementation in the near future.\n- I've added experimental dv5 support to my networking tool (https://github.com/protolambda/rumor)\n- Prysm has support for dv5 but not actively using it\n- Nimbus has dv5, but can use testing (https://our.status.im/nimbus-status-update-february-so-far/)\n- Lighthouse has dv5 in production\n\nIt would be great if we can coordinate better, which includes cross-client tests, and help the last few clients with implementation.",
