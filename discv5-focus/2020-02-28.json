I've also spent some time today investigating the discv5 implementation from Tuweni and have done a quick and dirty integration of it into Teku.  Both are able to do a handshake with Lighthouse running locally properly.  I seem to have done something bad to my local Lighthouse nodes and they aren't connecting to each other anymore, so not sure if discovery is actually working with the integration.",
