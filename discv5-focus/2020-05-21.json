        "content": "Hey @fjl nice work! \nI'm on board with the packet modifications. It doesn't seem like a huge amount of implementation overhead. \nIn regards to dpi resistance, my preference is to have it also. If we are going to change the packet format might as well add it in now. \nI like the idea that discv5 would then be harder till filter at scale. It costs us larger packet sizes and inevitable headaches in debugging, which I can live with if others can also. However was wondering about WHOAREYOU packets. Sender's won't know the dest IDs so can't encrypt. How are these handled to avoid dpi?",
