Will make a release if we are still planning on going ahead. \nLH may still validate ENR's it gets from cat-dog and they may fail validation. But if there is a cat-dog bootnode server up I can add into the LH release for nodes to connect to. So maybe 5.0 nodes will try to connect to the 5.1 peers.",
