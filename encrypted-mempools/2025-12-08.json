        "content": "Hey guys, we'd like to start the discussion for a universal, enshrined encrypted mempool (EEM) EIP and would like to share an early draft with you guys, gathering feedback and input before sharing it with a wider audience next week!\n\nThere's a couple of key points about this:\n\n- especially designed to fit into ePBS (and we think it sort of naturally aligns with ePBS very well)\n- encryption technology agnostic (generalized encrypted mempool interface, open to multiple key providers, who could use e.g. TEE or t-FHE)\n- adds the possibility of scheduling transactions into the future, with certain execution guarantees\n- optionally, it also has the potential to fix what flashbot brought up as the \"builder free option problem\" in ePBS via an additional round of encryption.\n\nDraft: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWUmIq--0JtG1y-jgfiUkGxtLFfgjCgpMBow0UzlHxs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ov10okwbnbxr\n\nWould be awesome to get your feedback on this, it's still in a relatively early state and we'd welcome all input!",
