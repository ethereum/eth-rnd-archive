    "content": "Interestingly, LUCID builds on top of EIP-7732 (ePBS) and EIP-7805 (FOCIL), extending both. It's also compatible with BALs (EIP-7928) since decrypted transactions are known before the builder constructs the block. So would need to either go in with FOCiL or after it. Can they go in together in Hegotá if they both headliners? They both seem more like CL changes.",
