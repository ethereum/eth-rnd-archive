    "content": "\"It's also compatible with BALs (EIP-7928) since decrypted transactions are known before the builder constructs the block.\"\n\nJust curious about this point. The builder of the block the the STs are included in won't know the decrypted transactions before constructing the block. Only the builder of the following block will know that.\n\nSo this isn't any different to what would happen in EIP 8105 right?",
