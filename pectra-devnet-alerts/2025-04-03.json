Any chance to make this reporting smarter so that CLs are not flagged when the same EL has issues with most of the CLs? Otherwise folks will just start to ignore those reports. \n\nI understand that those ELs should react immidiatelly and fix everything, but I'm not sure that those smaller ELs have availability to do it.",
