I know how blockchain works and have general understanding of Ethereum and how it operates but I find it difficult to understand that how should i start contributing , where to start and what to learn next for core development. I feel like I should start with playing around with Ethereum go client? I am not sure if anyone have any suggestions or resources please let me know!\nThanks",
