If that happens, the options arent great;\n\n\"If the affected validators try to rejoin the correct chain after applying a fix they would be slashed with the maximum correlation penalty.\n\nThe only other option is for the remaining non-affected clients to accept the bug, join the new chain and agree that the bug becomes the expected behavior of Ethereum's consensus layer from then on. Those minority clients would then be subject to inactivity penalties on the new chain even though they acted properly. \n\nThe former option is extremely expensive for the affected validators and logistically awkward to correct. The latter option would deeply undermine trust in Ethereum and cause us to accept a permanently tarnished chain.\"\n\nQuoted text from here: https://mirror.xyz/jmcook.eth/S7ONEka_0RgtKTZ3-dakPmAHQNPvuj15nh0YGKPFriA\n\nGiven the above, I agree with your final paragraph (\"It is in the best interest of all ETH holders and network users to get the network diversified\"). But I wouldnt say that ETH is \"safe\" from supermajority bugs, as there's still a chance that the buggy chain becomes the canonical chain, purely due to the amount of staked ETH that supported it, which means the \"correct validators\" would still be penalized.",
