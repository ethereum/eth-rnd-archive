I mean, kids could learn off of a L2 or ETHW but what would really be best is to have an ETH testnet that mirrors mainnet that allows people learning eth to interact with the network and test contracts. I think there would be a lot of value in encouraging dapps and others like uniswap, 1inch, etc. to maintaining a mirror/reflection on a testnet that new users to ETH could experiment with.\n\nI don't know about others cities, but here childhood education in programming/mechanics is taking off and the next logical step is getting them into crypto. I think eth-focused education materials oriented towards beginners/children are lacking.",
