        "content": "Hey guys, I have a (newbie) question about nonces and the mempool. My basic understanding is that the Ethereum network processes transactions sequentially, based on the nonce. So let's say I submit one transaction starting with nonce 0. But then I submit 5 other transactions with nonces ranging from 2-6. Then these transactions won't be included in the current block and will be waiting in the mempool (because the network is waiting for the transaction with nonce 1, which was never received).",
