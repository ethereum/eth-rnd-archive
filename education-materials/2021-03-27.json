If you want to get more in-depth after that, I'd recommend to look at tooling such as Remix (online solidity IDE) and Hardhat (dapp dev environment). This server is mostly focused on protocol engineering however, so maybe try the r/ethdev subreddit or other dapp-focused discords if you're looking to get into dapp development.",
