Specifically, as mentioned above, I am looking for information on possible whistleblowing messages being censored (at least temporarily) in Ethereum 2.0 network. Thanks to \u003c@!755590043632140352\u003e I used beaconcha.in (Validators \u003e Slashing tab) and checked each case individually. But what confuses me is how to determine WHEN the first whistleblow message happened. Take example of https://beaconcha.in/validator/4390#blocks . It says that this validator was \"Slashed by 11111 at Slot 17,184, Reason: Attestation Violation\". But how do I check when the first whistleblowing message actually took place?\n\nPlease help me with this, I would be eternally grateful for any kind of help!",

In this specific example, what have you done or looked into to try and find out how these messages are transmitted?  What research have you done to try and answer this question yourself?
