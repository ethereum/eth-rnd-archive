This means that ping, pong, find_node, or nodes packets may be lost, and it is said in specs that the sender should not resend the request. This seems like an added pain—why wouldn't we want reliable data transfer?\n\nBeing able to tolerate packet loss is a good thing, especially in the context of building your internal peer table quickly. It would give nodes the ability to function in the event of bad connectivity or allow implementations to throttle excessive inbound traffic.    The purpose of discovery isn't to be relaying real-time data, so packet loss isn't a big deal here.",
