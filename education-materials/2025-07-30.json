I've taken some courses and built simple chains but it feels like I've only learned about the past and not much about the future. Its like most of the learning material is stuck in 2018. There is alot of innovation going on and I have some ideas of my own too; I imagine some have been done already and others are not possible, but does anyone know of a good way to learn about the \"big events\" in the space? Ie. ETH Rolling out their PoS would definitely qualify as a major event imo. \nI just feel like I could spend a year working on something that other people have done already and not know it.",
