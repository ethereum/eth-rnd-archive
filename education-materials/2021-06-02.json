This might be a bit off topic but I always get the most informed, intelligent answers from ETH devs, so I'll ask anyway.\n\nWhat's the long term value prop for ether as a token being a sound investment given gas is about to drop by 99.95%, which could curb demand by a lot? I understand that staking returns come into play, but you can safely get similar returns on USD these days through DeFi. So what would be your number one reason for ether reaching new heights in the long term?\n\nThank you all",
