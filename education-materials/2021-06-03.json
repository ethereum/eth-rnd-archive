He mentions that having statelessness means we can move the state \u0026 execution layers easily on multiple shards. Does this also mean we could have multiple validator nodes, decentralizing it further or is this an entirely different thing? If so on the former, does that mean lighter client nodes? Thanks in advance 🙂",
