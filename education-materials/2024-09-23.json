Most clients can use both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time. (With Prysm being the only exception.)\n2. Even though IPv6 is supported, it’s not enabled by default because it hasn’t been tested enough.\n3. It would be helpful to run more nodes in a dual-stack configuration. This will help collect more data, get feedback, and find any bugs.\n4. The bootnodes should be ready to handle IPv6 traffic. Right now, only the Lighthouse provided bootnodes are IPv6-ready.\n\nThis might also be interesting for the EF DevOps. \u003c@199561711278227457\u003e",

Our bootnodes should also soon get dual stack, currently they are not running it due to lack of static ipv6 addresses in the cloud provider that we are using. The feature is coming soon, so hopefully we should be able to have dual stack on all of our bootnodes by EOY.",
