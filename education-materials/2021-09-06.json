        "content": "An address isn't \"created\" on the network, an address is just the public key. When a blockchain is started, all public keys in the world have 0 balance. Creating a wallet is generating a random private key and calculating its public key. To write any transaction on the blockchain on an address, we need that address' private key to sign that transaction. U can send funds to any address, but if the private key of that address is unknown to everybody or lost by its owner, that fund will be untouchable until somebody calculates the private key for it.",
