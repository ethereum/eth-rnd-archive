    "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI’m Kapil. I currently work on crypto forensics and blockchain analysis, including running and instrumenting full nodes and tracing execution-level data.\nThrough this work, I’ve developed a strong interest in Ethereum protocol development. \n\nMy plan is to deepen my theoretical understanding (Eth2 book, epf.wiki, specs) while simultaneously working hands-on with the Geth execution client.\n\nSince you people already worked extensively in this area, I’d really value your perspective, does this sound like the right direction to transition into a protocol engineering role, or is there something you’d suggest I prioritize differently to shorten the path?\n\nThanks for your time, I’d greatly appreciate any guidance.\n\nBest regards,\nKapil",
