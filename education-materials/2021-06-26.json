        "content": "thanks, just continuing past convo here but anyone feel free to chip in. i read the RLPx transport protocol u linked. it says in the 1st line that it is a \"TCP-based transport protocol used for communication amongst Ethereum nodes\". \n\nSo does this mean RLPx is built on top of TCP? In that case, would the networking stack look something like (from bottom-up): PHYSICAL:LINK:IP:TCP:RLPx:ethereum wire protocol. And why are two transport protocols needed? Does TCP provide the RDT service and RLPx something else?",
