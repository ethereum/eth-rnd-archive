However the full mathematical clarity of the spec is super helpful here and hard to find elsewhere. So my conundrum is intro resources to this stuff either have the math and assumes you know the basic cryptocurrency prerequisites, or they give more intro to the cryptocurrency prerequisites but don't have enough of the \"real\" math/constructions. It's been hard to \"put it all together\" and I'm too noob to fill in the gaps of the different resources for this level of audience without saying some things that are probably way off-base/wrong.",
