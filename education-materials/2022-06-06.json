        "content": "Depends what you mean by \"most users\". If you are just sending transactions on the network, basically nothing changes from the user PoV. You send your transaction to your node/MetaMask/etc. and it gets propagated over the network. The validator which produces the next block will include it (assuming gas price is high enough like today). \n\nFor users who want to be validators, there are many options: if you have 32 ETH, you can run your own validator. With 16 ETH, you can run a rocket pool one. If you have less than that, there are different pools or exchanges you can use. In that case, you do trust the pool or exchange with the security of your funds. You can check out this page for more info: https://ethereum.org/en/staking/",
