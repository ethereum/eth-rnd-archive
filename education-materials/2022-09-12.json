With the merge approaching, I'm sure everyone is busy, but wanted to post a link to the PR and preview for the \"post-merge\" content updates we're bringing to ethereum.org. Any eyes on this would be appreciated.\n\nThere are a lot of changes, so if you only have time for laying eyes on a couple pages, the `/upgrades/merge` page specifically would probably be where I'd suggest (or also maybe the `/energy-consumption page`)\n\nPreview: https://build-eae1f9b7-2544-4fb3-9d3f-abe2b5e5c4e7.gtsb.io/en/upgrades/merge\nPR: https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pull/7190\n\nCheer and happy merge week!",
