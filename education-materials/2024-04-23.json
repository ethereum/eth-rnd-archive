        "content": "Hello ,\nI am currently researching anomaly detection in validator behavior with the use of classification models, for my computer science bachelor's thesis. I am interested in understanding the lifecycle of validators, their decision-making motivations, issues related to censorship and areas where they can influence or gain advantages in the network. There are a lot of diagrams and overviews online, but it is hard to find detailed documentation on what validators attest. From my understanding of the yellow paper and the EIPs github, during the attestation phase the validators only look at block header reference and ordering of the blocks and not necessarily look into the transactions inside the block. For me this seems problematic, as block proposers now have a certain monopoly in their 12 second slot to put any transactions they want without external verification.  Another question I had was that the protocol ensures that only one validator is designated as the proposer for a particular slot, and therefore not allowing concurrency, how the network is able to scale with such a large network. Is this solved by sharding or is the concurrency at another level?\nI am looking for the same kind of conceptual abstraction as in this book: \nhttps://eth2book.info/capella/part2/\n\nAs a student I am still learning about the protocol and I believe that these problems are already solved, but I would be very curious to know how.\n\nWould anyone be interested in discussing these topics or providing further insights?  \nI am particularly interested in gaining information from validators themselves to better understand their incentives and learn more about the general experiences. \nThank you in advance (sorry for  the long message)",
