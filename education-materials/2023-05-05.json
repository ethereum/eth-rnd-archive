        "content": "Hi there, excuse the long post. \n\nI'm helping to organize a reading/study group with a bunch of cryptography PhDs (and some cryptography students) who are basically super well versed in all the technical topics (particularly MPC and ZKP) but know almost nothing about \"cryptocurrency.\" Pretty low key thing (one meeting every week or two weeks throughout summer and fall)\n\nSo far I've been the \"resident cryptocurrency one\" who can help give some intuition for what's at stake, and the interesting crypto problems that need to be solved etc. except the problem is I am NOT a PhD nor a true \"expert\" in all the ways the math is being plugged into the base layer (i'm more of an application layer / defi dev in reality)\n\nSo two questions:\n\n1. **Are there resources that are good for this kind of audience?** It's sort of the REVERSE of typical resources/audience (where the math is what's expected to be opaque to them, but a lot of knowledge of the \"cryptocurrrency space\" is assumed). I'm sure that an expert in cryptography + cryptocurrency could get them on the right path quickly, they just need to understand the \"why\" of the particular blockchain settings and the important trade-offs\n\n2. Does someone who thinks they could be that kind of role interested in attending (one or more sessions)? Can give more details if it sounds interesting/approriate for you. Feel free to dm me. In general those reading this who might be interested in such a reading group feel free to dm.\n\nThanks!",
