Then when a RPC node returns the balance, it should also come with a Merkle proof. The client then checks this Merkle proof with the tracked state-root and proceeds.\n\nThis means you do not have trust blindly the RPC node. With Merkle proof validation, the trustless promise of Ethereum extends to dapps as well then.\n\nYes it also means that the client is running a light client to keep track of the state-root",
