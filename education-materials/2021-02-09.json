        "content": "Hi, so I need some help/ ideas. I'm in final year in Bachelor of Applied Mathematics and I need to write this final paper. So I was thinking about AI (since University gives money for that and AI is kinda future topic) combinedwith Ethereum.  So  Our profesor offered me a topic about \"authenticity and anonymity\" in Ethereum combined with AI or machine learning. In other words I want to ask any ideas or links what would help with this topic. I guess writing in private would be better. Also profesor pointed to investigate how public key is kept in transaction, what is the format of v, r, s values in it? So I have like 4 months to do this project and I think I can do an experiment or something in that time. Maybe You guys spare some time for that? Thank u so much.",

        "content": "\u003c@!404008509114417154\u003e If you want to look into anonymity I recommend you look at Nansen and Dune analytics, who are analyzing ethereum as a service. Nansen has a discord too I think. And you name reminds me of https://amberdata.io/, also an analytics platform. Regarding v,r,s: it's part of the way transactions are confirmed to be of the sender. Signature data and such. You can find these technical details in the ethereum yellow paper: https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf",
