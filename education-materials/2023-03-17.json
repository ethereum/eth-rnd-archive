After digesting dankrad feist's `kate-polynomial-commitments` blog post, I attempted to test my understanding by implementing a \"toy\" version of kzg commitment generation, proof generation, and proof verification over bls12-381 ec pairing in python (see it here: https://github.com/kassandraoftroy/kzg-python-toy). And I think I've got it working now. While nowhere near the \"real thing\" a toy impl could be a useful reference for others like me, also trying to grasp the main constructions without all the extra requirements and optimizations that invariably come with a complete spec or client's implementation. Maybe it's useful to someone!\n\nI definitely have some lingering questions about the official polynomial commitment spec (e.g. I'm not sure I understand what `KZG_LAGRANGE_SETUP` is from the trusted setup and why we use these and not `KZG_SETUP_G1` when doing G1 linear combination to get the commitment `C = P(s)*G1` ) but idk this may not be the venue for those types of questions. Any resources to dive even deeper into these cryptographic primitives and efficiently implementing them is def appreciated!",
