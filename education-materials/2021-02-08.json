Security properties and quality of new PoS chain are going to be highly evaluated before switching off the PoW. IMO, there is no way back to PoW once it's been turned off and the beacon chain will have to be fixed if something bad happens, though, after months of evaluation it seems to be much less realistic scenario.",
