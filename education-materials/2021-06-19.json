Echoing \u003c@!730609958638321694\u003e 's question a bit, I've been reading Andreas' 'Mastering Ethereum', and noticed he mentioned that each transaction, when mined, updates the \"singleton state\" of Ethereum. I'm trying to understand what the quality of \"state\" is here - is each node holding an in-memory store of the entire current state of ethereum (seems like an impractically large ask), or is the singleton state simply the modified stored ledger. That is, is the \"singleton state\" 's representation an in-memory one, or a storage one?",
