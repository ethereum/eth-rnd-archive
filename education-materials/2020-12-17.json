        "content": "Are \"rollups\" in use in ethereum 1 mainnet? On one hand, it sounds like rollups have been in use for at least several months. However, I've been reading and reading about the various strategies for rollups (zero-knowledge, optimistic, shadow-chain, etc.), but the more I read the more it sounds like the ethereum mainnet needs to be \"in on the game\". That is, the Ethereum protocol needs to be adjusted to handle rollups (handle penalties, rewards, validation (or not), and applying state transitions to the mainnet from the rollup). But with so many competing strategies, surely Ethereum doesn't support them all...it makes me think that Ethereum doesn't support any of them. Or, then again, perhaps someone smart has come up with a way to do rollups without adjusting the Ethereum protocol? But where do I read about that?\nI trust my ramblings above demonstrate my utter confusion on the topic. Are rollups currently in use? (If so, I have many more questions!)",
