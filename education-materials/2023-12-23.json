I recently wrote a comprehensive overview of data availability policies in (Ethereum) rollups: https://ethereum2077.substack.com/p/data-availability-in-ethereum-rollups. \n\nWith the ideas of \"modular data availability\" and \"modular settlement layers\" gaining more adoption, I believe it's important to re-iterate the core design principles underpinning Ethereum rollups (i.e., rollups entirely secured by L1). And it's even more important to clarify the implications of rollups using external data availability services (whilst settling on Ethereum)--especially for the benefit of users interacting with applications on said rollups.",
