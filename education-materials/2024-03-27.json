        "content": "**EIP-7503: Zero-Knowledge Wormholes** introduces a mechanism for privacy-preserving transfers based on zero-knowledge proofs and removes one of the biggest obstacles to Ethereum’s adoption (a lack of transaction privacy). Unlike opt-in privacy tools like Tornado Cash, EIP-7503 makes it possible to transact privately and natively on Ethereum and has the benefit of providing a larger anonymity set and stronger guarantees of plausible deniability for users conducting private transfers.\n\n*EIPs For Nerds #5: EIP-7503 (Zero-Knowledge Wormholes)* provides a comprehensive overview of EIP-7503 and answers related to the proposal, such as:\n\n1. What do ‘private transfers’ and ‘anonymous transactions’ mean? Aren’t blockchains like Ethereum supposed to be “anonymous and private” already?\n\n2. Why is financial privacy important? Is privacy only for people with something to hide? Are there legitimate use-cases that require a feature for executing private transfers of funds on Ethereum?\n\n3. How do existing privacy solutions like cryptocurrency mixers (Tornado Cash) and privacy blockchains based on ring signatures \u0026 ZK-SNARKs (Monero/Zcash) maintain privacy?\n\n4. What issues do privacy applications like Tornado Cash face that make a protocol-level privacy solution desirable?\n\n5. What are the considerations for a base-layer privacy solution?\n\nRead the full article on the Ethereum 2077 blog: https://ethereum2077.substack.com/p/eip-7503-zero-knowledge-wormholes.",
