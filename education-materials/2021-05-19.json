(Sorry if this seems rudimentary, I’ve been reading everything I could find about gas all day, but everything I read seems super vague on it)\n\nhttps://ethereum-magicians.org/t/charging-gas-for-reading-a-view-function-in-a-transaction-seems-odd/5766",

In some sense gas only exists at the moment the transaction is being performed; after this the associated gas becomes relevant again if the transaction is replayed / a contract is called. \n\nThere is a block gas limit, which is just like it sounds: how much gas you can fit into a given block. Each block has it's own gas limit in the blockhead. Since nodes computing transactions has a cost in the real world, and since sending blocks between nodes takes time and bandwidth, and since transactions are being stored (their data takes up bytes somewhere), the idea is to have the gas costs of transactions closely match the imposed costs on the network. \n\nYour hard drive has a fixed capacity of bytes it can store: in natural language we might say that a file takes up 'space' even though we're not really talking about something spatial. Since blocks have limited gas capacity, when a block is at or near capacity and running out of 'space' for more transactions, we say the block is 'full'.",
