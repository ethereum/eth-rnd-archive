If Ethereum is going to be the \"app store\" but for dapps, I'd imagine the infra needs some sort of analogue to the relational databases of the app world. E.g., say I wanted to build a decentralized ride share app (same concept, just no middlemen taking cuts), in order to pull that off I'd still need users with accounts, ride history etc, and would need to both store/query that info. Does Ethereum natively offer this functionality, and if not, how would I obtain it?",
