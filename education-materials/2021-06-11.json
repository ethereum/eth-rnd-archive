Whereas Ethereum seems to be using ETH for both gas and staking (staking itself is a _form of governance_, right?). \n\nCan someone help me with understanding these decision tradeoffs? What can i start reading?",

I think it's more that Dai is a product of the DAO, just like exchanges/betting markets/etc are products of other DAOs.\n\nAs far as on-chain governance is concerned (and why Ethereum _doesn't_ do it), you can start here:\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html",
