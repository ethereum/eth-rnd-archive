Active validator set is about 409k. There are about About 225 epochs per day so about 16000 exits (assumed no activations) would happen in about 12 days at the 6 threshold. Then it would step down to the 5 per epoch threshold.\n\nIf we assume 60 days until merge, we get a 12 day window of 6 per epoch, then a 48 day window of 5 per epoch\n* 409k - 6\\*225\\*12 = 393k\n* 393k - 5\\*225\\*48 = 339k\n\nso certainly more than 300k active validators at the merge. The above math assumes full exit queue and no new entrants",
