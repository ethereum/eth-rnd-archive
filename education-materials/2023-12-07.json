I created a chatGPT trained on Ben's eth2book and see if it can serve as a general reference on the CL protocol, and it works quite well! See https://x.com/ensi321/status/1732639680758489128 . I think it has potential to become a one-stop shop for all protocol's related questions including latest protocol development, tooling, testing, ecosystem etc. Let me know what you think🙂",
