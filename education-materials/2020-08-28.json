(Reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/iej8uo/announcing_the_eth2_studymaster_program_earn_a/ and https://discordapp.com/channels/694822223575384095/746732830691688467/746733307609350235). So far In the first week a hundred people have participated in the quiz and are on their way to earning a POAP (The window is still open for about 48 hours if you'd like to participate!). I'm planning to develop a solid repetoire of articles located in reputable sources, but I realize that you all might have awesome suggestions for selected readings. I have a few basic goals for the readings: \n1) They should target a tenth grade reading level \n2) They should not rely heavily on equations \n3)  They should introduce users to reputable sources for further study\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of sources I'd like to draw from:\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/\nhttps://ethereum-magicians.org/\nhttps://vitalik.ca/\nhttps://www.attestant.io/posts/\nhttps://docs.ethhub.io/\nhttps://kb.beaconcha.in/\nhttps://arxiv.org/search/?query=ethereum+staking\u0026searchtype=all\u0026source=header\n\nWhat suggestions can you provide for articles?",
