        "content": "I'm not sure what kind of a response I'm hoping to get from this, but I figured someone in this chat would likely have some helpful advice. I'm very interested in blockchain technology and would like to have a career in it. However, I find there is quite a lot of things to know in this space, and I sometimes find it hard to know where I should be focusing my energy or even what my end goal should be (front end dev, solidity dev, something else).\n\nMy current skills/ Knowledge (Intermediate understanding):\n    Javascript\n    Python \n    C++\n    Complexity Analisys \n    Data Structers\n    Algorithems\n    Consepts related to blockchain:\n        Hashing Algorithems\n        Private key / Public key cryptography (surface level)\n        Consensus (PoW, PoS)\n        Governance (Hard forks vs Soft foks vs On-Chain)\n        Smart Contracts (Solidity)\n        Terminology (Blocks, Transactions, Roll-ups, \nComposability, etc.)\n\nThings I'm interested in learning:\n    Rust\n    Web Assembly \n    Machine Learning \n    ZKproofs\n    React\n    More about:\n        Eth2 Consensus\n        Smart Contract development\n        Web3\n        EVM / Ewasm\n\nAbout me:\nI was enrolled in university studying computer science until (among other reasons) I realized how old the curriculum I was learning was, so, at the start of the pandemic, I decided to advance my education through online educational resources instead. I had become very interested in the space (Ethereum in particular) starting in 2017. I have recently been reading articles, GitHub conversations, and listings to core dev meetings on youtube to understand everything that's going on.\n\nAny advice / Educational resources would be appreciated!",
