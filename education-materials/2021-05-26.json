        "content": "Hello, my mind is going bonkers. This might be about Zero Knowledge Proofs. When I deposit funds (1ETH) in L1 Contract so I can transact with an L2 network. Then my friend does the same thing deposit 1ETH. \n\n- In L2 , how does it communicate to L1 to know what the current funds are, do they just have an ETH1 connection open to their contract and just read it (0 gas)? L2 needs to know about the deposit information.\n- When my friend sends me 1 ETH from L2, only L2 keeps the state of the funds right? So how does the contract in L1 update so that the transactions are 100% trusted? \n\nAssuming this has something to do with zk rollups / optimistic rollups, is the basic idea is that we can prove that I have 2 ETH and my friend has 0 ETH, we don't need the transaction history? \n\nI am having a hard way to understand how the protocol works how does both layers L1 and L2 communicate.",
