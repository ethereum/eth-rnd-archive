He also claimed N could be several million in the worst case, and it sounded like he was saying it was infeasible to check thoroughly. Is this accurate? Is it possible that validators are doing surround voting and getting away with it because checking is too difficult?",

        "content": "I'd suggest you start with a literature study on what metrics may or may not make sense for EVM-chains or Ethereum clients. You keep throwing the term \"benchmark\" around, but that is really rather broad and vague. Same goes for scalability, latency, and throughput. \n\nI'd also say that this is not really the server for support questions (like formulating your research question/hypothesis), see the message in \u003c#745072678079168654\u003e . Maybe Ethereum stack exchange or Reddit would be better, but even then I'd still suggest starting with diving into the literature yourself first. Take a look at some Ethereum conference talks/presentations/papers, ethresear.ch, or just browse related/cited papers with scholar.google.com. \n\nOne general suggestion I'd have is though is to narrow your scope, by _a lot_.",
