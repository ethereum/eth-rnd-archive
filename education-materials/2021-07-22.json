        "content": "May someone please clarify for me what is the crypto used on Ethereum: \nThis book says: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-ethereum/9781491971932/ch04.html\nSays that “There is no encryption as part of the Ethereum protocol—all messages that are sent as part of the operation of the Ethereum network can (necessarily) be read by everyone. As such, private keys are only used to create digital signatures for transaction authentication.”\n\nBut this source https://research.nccgroup.com/2019/12/20/passive-decryption-of-ethereum-peer-to-peer-traffic/ says the opposite: \n“The RLPx protocol, used in the current version of Ethereum, defines the transport protocol used to encapsulate Ethereum RPC messages. …\nIn short, Ethereum nodes use Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman to derive a shared secret for the RLPx session. This shared secret is then used with a key derivation function to derive a key for encryption and authentication. The derived keys are used by the peers to encrypt and authenticate network-layer messages.”",
