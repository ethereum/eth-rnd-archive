And when it's time for a node to execute the transactions of the newest mined block (that has been approved by the network), for each transaction, I imagine the node is loading into memory the state of the two accounts involved (i.e. an EOA transferring ether to another EOA, or an EOA calling a function in a contract account), executing the relevant code, causing state transition, and then persisting the state changes to disk (e.g. persisting new account balances or contract state). Is that right?",

Then when the process is complete you merge the sub branch to the master branch(Layer 1 of ETH). \n\nCorrect me if I am wrong?",
