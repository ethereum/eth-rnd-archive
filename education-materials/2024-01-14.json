Repo here if anyone is interested: https://github.com/bingcicle/kzigg This port isn't 100% faithful to the spec though, did just enough to understand the scheme. Also wrote a non-scientific, somewhat braindumpy article that I wrote mostly to explain concepts to myself: https://bingcicle.github.io/posts/grug-brained-guide-to-kzg-polynomial-commitments.html. Any feedback/comments appreciated!",
