So specifically I am looking for information on slashings/whistleblowing in Ethereum 2.0 network. Ideally, the data I am looking for is to let me know whether any whistleblowing messages were censored (at least temporarily) so that they failed to impose a deserved slashing. I am wondering if (1) such data exists, (2) if there is some kind of API tool that I could use to get it?\n\nI'd really appreciate any help!",
