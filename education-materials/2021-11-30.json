How long did it take you to acquire the knowledge/skill set you have today? \n\nI find myself wanting to dive even deeper into Ethereum beyond smart contracts and even perhaps even be competent enough to contribute to core development one day. A quick glance through the Ethereum Research forum, Github repos and this Discord channel shows the heavy theoretical basis that Ethereum is built on. I understand that this project is ever-evolving and constantly changing, to the point where it seems like a race to keep up with its rapid development, but I still want to be involved 🙂\n\nI feel like the answer is to just stick around and learn as I go. Any other direction or guidance would be greatly appreciated!",
