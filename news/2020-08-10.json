It represented the final point before the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 network, which is tentatively expected by the end of the year.\n\nIn light of these developments, we were thrilled to have an opportunity to interview Danny Ryan - Core Researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. He gave insights of Eth 2.0 progress, talked about PoS and Casper sharding, shared his thoughts on the Ethereum future, the benefits of Eth 2.0 for the community and challenges involved in bringing Ethereum 2.0 to life.\n\n⬙ Check out the interview via the link below:\nhttps://t.co/zXviW5a9cM?amp=1",
