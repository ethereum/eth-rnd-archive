Would like client team feedback on whether we should bump the `eth` protocol version\n\nArgument for and against bumping will be aggregated here: https://notes.ethereum.org/M41Oj3WyRVSC36Rr0c-Tjg\n\nI believe \u003c@\u0026688101493978562687\u003e had some opposition which I don't feel confident enough in my memory to accurately write down, so it'd be helpful if someone from that can provide me with a write up of their stance.\n\nThose that plan to pursue EIP-7801 based solution, it would be nice to know if the proposed ideas in the document are acceptable solutions.",
