        "content": "I disagree on the purpose of DLT.  IMO, the purpose is to come to consensus on current state, not to store a permanent record of history.  One strategy for this is to maintain a journal of all transactions so anyone can reconstruct current state and then you only need to come to consensus on the hash of the current state (which is much simpler and can be done in under a second).  However, you don't need *all* of history to achieve this, you only need an agreed point in history that is agreeable on human timescales (L0 can come to consensus on it).",
