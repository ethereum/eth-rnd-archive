        "content": "(Just trying to be concrete on the actual requirements here)\n\nI guess it’s possible that if portal only supplies historical block queries and the node stores an index of tx hash to block. Then, if I get an rpc call for a tx hash, I look in the index to see what block it belongs to, then I query portal for that block\n\nIn terms of storage, it is better than status quo but in terms of bandwidth it’s not great.\n\nAlso if a node syncs from scratch they will need to s build up this tx hash to block lookup table by either querying portal or downloading it from somewhere else",
