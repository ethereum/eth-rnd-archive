I am okay to accept this and if individual client teams want to release checksums for their era files, they may do that. We just wont have the expectation that they are all identical.\n2) some clients can't process historical receipt format, so they can't produce era1 files -\u003e also okay with this. We only need 1-2 impls of this get started.",
