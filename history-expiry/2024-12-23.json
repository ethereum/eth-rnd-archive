        "content": "For removing block downloads from `eth` and moving to separate subprotocol:\nI don't understand what this improves practically, or why it would be necessary.\n\nw.r.t. version bump for 4444: the eip does not seem like a p2p protocol change. My reasoning is that it is just loosening restrictions on what nodes serve. Currently these restrictions are enforced by each node's peer scoring, so to me the EIP is essentially just a recommendation for how to implement scoring rules and bodies download logic. In a pre-4444 world, if peers do not have a block, we still have to _eventually_ churn peers to find a peer that does have it. Non-upgraded nodes would do this in a post-4444 world as well. Given the SHOULD NOT language, 4444 seems backwards compatible to me.\n\nThe bigger question is whether or not remaining on an existing version while nodes drop history, will lead to a healthy network post transition (the asymmetric upgrades question afaict). It looks like this will just increase the churn rate for nodes that are not upgraded / are still attempting to download blocks from genesis\n\nlmk if this makes sense",
