And how we arrived to the Era file format as the format for satisyfing these requirements?\n\nI am asking as I wonder about what should we do about clients who have implemented their own \"append-only stores\" for history already such as Geth's ancients, Erigon's minimal-perfect-hash-function-based static files, and Reth's new custom static files.\n\nThere's also other common archival formats which are very popular in big data world, such as Parquet or Lance, and I wonder if there was an investigation in them?\n\nApologies if this was asked / discussed already, happy to read up, just didn't find a great comparison on initial search.\n\n(I've read Matt's PR above)",
