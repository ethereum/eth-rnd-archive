There's a repo at https://github.com/henridf/eip44s-proto that has the spec of an SSZ encoding for headers/blocks/receipts, and a tool implementing the spec and that is intended as wip of the tool we'd use for EIP-4444.\n\nAny feedback and 👀  are welcome; I'd especially be interested in any feedback on the SSZ spec that's at https://github.com/henridf/eip44s-proto/issues/1",
