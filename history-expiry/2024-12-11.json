I am still pondering so all input is welcome. this would mean that Erigon would do the expiry 3 months earlier in a stable release as we are aiming to release v3 pre-pectra",

If the behavior isn't universalizable, it should be locked away behind an experimental flag that requires explicit opt-in.",
