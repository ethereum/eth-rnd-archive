If it's something that you would like to prioritize I would encourage you to get started on your integrations with the Portal network in the next few weeks.  Devcon is coming and it will be highly valuable to have at least one member of your team who has dug into the Portal protocol.  We will be hosting talks and content related to Portal and there is going to be a huge difference in how much information exchange can occur if you have at least one person on your team who has done a deep dive.  Also your users will probably love freeing up hundreds of GB of disk space on their machines.",
