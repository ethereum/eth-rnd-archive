        "content": "The lack of discovery mechanism in DevP2P and the need to brute force search the network for peers with the necessary data are I believe the parts that make 7801 not-elegant, and why I'd be hesitant to enshrine it in the `eth` protocol.  I think the solution is workable but not good-enough to require all clients to implement it. I recognize I'm not developing a DevP2P client so... my opinions may not really matter here.",

        "content": "Use of 7801 handshake includes information about block ranges, which users of 7801 use for more than just \"earliestAvailableBlock\", so enshrining 7801 handshake into the `eth` protocol would enshrine 7801 functionality into the `eth` protocol that later would be difficult to remove because 7801 users would be relying on it for additional functionality.  So \"yes\", 7801 handshake would suffice for advertising this information to other clients.  My comment above is meant to warn against this approach because I'm dubious that enshrining 7801 into `eth` protocol is a good idea because I don't see it as an endgame solution for history distribution for ethereum clients.",
