We are excited to share that we are working on Shisui, a Go Portal implementation, available at https://github.com/optimism-java/shisui/tree/portal. This project is heavily based on Geth, reusing many components such as Ethereum data structures, DHT, and more. The history and beacon networks have successfully passed most Hive interop tests, which you can view here. We look forward to collaborating with the Geth team and potentially contributing our code upstream.",
