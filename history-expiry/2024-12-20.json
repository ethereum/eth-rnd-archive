As well as anyone else who wants to further advocate for the bump.  Given that I'm not representing a client I'm no longer going to advocate for the bump myself.  \n\nAlso \u003c@429719902363058177\u003e was in support of the bump.  Can you contextualize that support?  Are you strongly in support and wish to argue for it?  Or are you happy  acquiescing to whatever the majority decides?",
