        "content": "Hi! I was wondering if the possibility of pruning pre-Merge state in a hash-based Geth archive node was theoretically possible. My goal is to make the node lighter than the current ~20TB while still responding to eth_getProof for post-Merge blocks but not keeping any data at all for pre-Merge blocks, which I assume would make the database way smaller. The goal is to have the lightest client possible that can do this task. It doesn't necessarily have to be Geth though, but it's one of the only ones I know that supports this endpoint for historical blocks. (I think Nethermind does as well)\nIf anyone knows anything about this or there's a previous conversation regarding this I'd really appreciate the help, thanks!",
