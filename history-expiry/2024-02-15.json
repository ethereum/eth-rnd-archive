I want to jump on discussion here! \n\n I think that's great idea to have is set marks (year or few) at which network prunes it's history, ideally with a new \"genesis\" block and initial state. While the old one is referenced by hash and must be obtained from archive-ish nodes. \n\nThe concern I have  is proposal to use \"torrents/ipfs/etc we don't sure what\" to store archive data. This is not really solid. Recall you'r country tax laws regarding how long receitps and legal documents must be stored. It's often 3-5-7 years or even longer, which ideally - we want to have decentralized model to ensure availability. Otherwise you have to keep your own data yourself, and that's not a DLT anymore. \n\nSolution to that as I see is to begin with something a little else - we need to define the peer-to-peer data marketplace. Other words saying - it's RPC endpoint marketplace in decentralized way, which would allow archive nodes directly (or by using service like swarm) to monetize archived data.  That would be also a great initiative on it own as this could create incentives to run light nodes and use them instead of relying on centralized RPC providers. \n\nIf this is designed in a right way, it should be then possible to either ensure data availability for expired history \n\nI had these thoughts outlined a while ago on the forum, but only now found this amazing server and a channel to share here.  \nhttps://ethresear.ch/t/economics-for-p2p-rpc-data-marketplace/17214",
