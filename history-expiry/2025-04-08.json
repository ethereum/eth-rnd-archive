        "content": "History Expiry Breakout Call Notes\n\n`eth/69` should be updated as follows:  Agreement on the call from Besu, Geth, Nethermind, and Reth.\n\n- Status message should be updated to include `earliestBlock` and `latestBlock`.  This is to allow clients to more efficiently avoid connecting to clients that do not have useful block data.\n- New \"announcement\" style message added to protocol that includes `earliestBlock` and `latestBlock`.  This message should be sent once per epoch.  It was agreed that this announcement style message was preferable to a request/response to avoid polling patterns in client implementations.\n\nThe justification for `earliestBlock` addition is so that clients can communicate the beginning of the history range they can serve from locally available data.  \n\nThe justification for `latestBlock` is from multiple reasons.  \n\n1) To allow full sync clients to communicate the status of their sync  \n3) To provide a signaling mechanism that indicates participation in the protocol.\n\nA modification to 7801 to change the storage ranges to align with Era file ranges was highlighted: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9331\n\nPiper (me) requested feedback on the History Expiry Meta EIP: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9572/files",
