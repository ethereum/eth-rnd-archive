Clients that want to keep serving history will not do it on the eth protocol. And my understanding was that serving history on the eth protocol is not adesired by client teams and that is why we changed 7801 to be a seperate protocol. But now this addition makes eth protocol still able to serve history. If that is the case then we can have 7801 directly on eth protocol instead of a etha protocol\nEip7801 for reference here:  https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7801",

More recent is kept. The idea to use eth/69 as a 'marker' for pruned mode was floated in ACD, but it was later rejected by all clients. So eth/69    implementation doesn't mean the client has no history.\n\nThe general history storage model is one where we assume the client has all recent history up to some point, and either \n\n- none before\n- some history before, but it's not specified which \n\nThe eth protocol as proposed implements exactly the baseline assumption and nothing else. For the purpose of eth protocol, you only want to sync recent history back to the merge (or another point for testnets) and then you need to get the rest somewhere else, if you want it.",
