Few things come to mind:\n\n- Likely some modifications we'd need to do on our end because much of what is in the clients is mainnet centric and my guess is that there'd be a few things that would need to be adjusted to make the clients network agnostic.\n- Tiny networks of only a small number of nodes may behave weird.  Again, likely small client modifications necessary to make this work.\n- Initializing data into those nodes would also probably need a little work.  \n\nWe have our weekly implementers call happening in 20 minutes.  Link will be announced in \u003c#1331655016993394770\u003e .  I'll add this as an agenda item for us to discuss.",
