        "content": "we are in the design phase of a different sync strategy for besu, with a goal of being ready for CL queries as quickly as possible.  \n\nIn our current post-merge sync strategy, the chain sync is the slowest.  One of the strategies we are looking at for being online and available quickly is to prioritize the worldstate download, and sync the chain backwards in the background.  \n\nDuring this async chain back-filling, it might be beneficial to use to use portal network to service RPC queries for chain history we do not yet have.  Rather than just returning empty response, we could temporarily forward queries to and proxy responses from portal.\n\nYou mentioned portal doesn't implement a bulk query api, but did as for the ideal use case ;).   Ideally, we could use portal network to allow us to respond to CL queries for deposit logs during this backfilling sync period.  \n\nThis might be made moot by EIP-4881, but in the interim, having chain data back to the genesis of the deposit contract is the primary need for chain data for an EL/CL validating pair.",
