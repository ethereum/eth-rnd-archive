What we're doing is **allowing** nodes that are part of DevP2P to no longer maintain history pre-merge.  It doesn't require them to drop the data.  It allows them to drop it if they wish to.  Nodes that operate as archive nodes will likely still do so.  Nodes that want to operate as RPC providers with local data will still likely keep all the history.  Nodes that want to operate at a lighter disk footprint can (and probably will) drop the history to reduce hard drive requirements.  This is a devp2p change, allowing nodes to do less, if they choose to.",
