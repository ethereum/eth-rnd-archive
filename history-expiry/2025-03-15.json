        "content": "Better to think of 4444s as a devp2p change.  Nodes in the network are all free to do what they want.  What we're doing is **allowing** nodes that are part of DevP2P to no longer maintain history pre-merge.  It doesn't require them to drop the data.  It allows them to drop it if they wish to.  Nodes that operate as archive nodes will likely still do so.  Nodes that want to operate as RPC providers with local data will still likely keep all the history.  Nodes that want to operate at a lighter disk footprint can (and probably will) drop the history to reduce hard drive requirements.  This is a devp2p change, allowing nodes to do less, if they choose to.",

        "content": "I also like to think of 4444 + portal as the EL’s version of ePBS. Since there you split validators’ tasks into multiple separate roles like proposer or builder or both. And 4444 gives people the choice to participate exclusively in the creation of new history (full node w/ pruned old history) or maintenance \u0026 exchange of old history (portal light client) or both (full node w/ portal integration) thus again splitting current full nodes’ tasks into multiple separate roles",
