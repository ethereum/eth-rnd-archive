Contingent on that formats for storing historical data and validation of canonical-ness for pre-merge data was stated as being stable where post-merge wasn’t. So the idea was stated that if the Portal Network’s history network was in production and work done for using BitTorrent which uses ERA files was done. We could do pre-merge 4’4s (I assume on testnet) within a rough ballpark of a year. Leaving post-merge 4’4s for later. So doing 4'4s in 2 stages.\n\nThis was a middle ground reached by representatives of Geth and Nethermind respectively.",

We already held a few of these meetings during Devconnect and they were found to be very mutually beneficial.",
