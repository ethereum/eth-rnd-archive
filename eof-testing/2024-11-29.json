Pls upgrade and report if stuff works (or PR directly to [the testing matrix](https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/blob/main/spec/implementation_matrix.md#testing-readiness-matrix)).\n\n**NOTE**: There are now EOF blockchain_tests with coverage not included anywhere else, so be sure to run these too (they're just state tests wrapped in blockchain format for convenience - good portion of legacy EVM coverage from `ethereum/tests` ported over to EOF).",
