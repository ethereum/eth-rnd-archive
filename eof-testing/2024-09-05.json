For example, I saw fixtures with null `prestate`, missing `currentRandom`, some type 3 txs missing accessLists etc. Is this expected and should I make some assumptions about those values while running? Or will it be fixed in an upcoming release?",

That release of extra tests is just to complement EOF testing, while we migrate the coverage to EEST. We'll see about filtering these out. Are there many occurrences of these?",
