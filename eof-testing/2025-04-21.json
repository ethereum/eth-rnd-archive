One section could have an invalid opcode while a second could have invalid stack validaion, an efficient algo would bail at the first detected opcode, and requireing them to report the first error in the firs section encodes into the protocol iniefficincy.  The only thing consensus requires is an assertion that it is valid or invalid, no why.",
