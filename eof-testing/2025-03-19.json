Some lines missed are unreachable, or irrelevant plumbing or unused \"advanced/JITing\" mode, but there are some gaps to identify and fill here and there. So my info on the call was not up-to-date. (note however, that you get a few % more if you turn `ethereum_tests` flag on as well). I also have a feeling some gaps are due to [7702-EXT*CALL interaction PR](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1309) not in the 2.2.0 release yet.\n\nShould I write down some explainer to help navigate this report?",
