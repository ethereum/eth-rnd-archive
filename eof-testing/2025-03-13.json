Specifically, the exec spec test release?\n\nTLDR: PeerDAS is starting to incorporate changes that need the EL, so its easier for us to build on top of a \"snapshot\" of the EL that's considered stable. \n\nSo i'd like to propose all ELs build on top of exec spec tests eip7692@2.1.0 (if thats latest), that way we can proceed with blob increase testing (gas schedule needs fulu on the EL side) as well as cell proof computation changes without needing to keep up with EOF. Once eof-devnet-1 is done and feature frozen, we can bump the EL peerDAS branch again and eventually discuss merging everything in.",
