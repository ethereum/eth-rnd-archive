However, IIRC Besu passed similar tests when we were experimenting with this, so not sure. I'll look into this more closely next week. If you're curious whether apart from this these tests pass, you can ignore the gas limit change failures, they should be irrelevant to the gist of those tests.",

The main differences from those old ones are (should be): some bytecode is eof-wrapped and test is targetting Osaka. But I'd still suspect evmone refilling is the culprit, which I'll look into soon™️",
