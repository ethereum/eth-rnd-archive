A bit more complex but it's a valid implementation. Unless you are doing a fail fast approach, which I also prefer, but might also be doable.\n\nSince validation messages don't get leaked on the chain then I agree that it doesn't matter. They could possibly show up in tracing and we would have to decode each of the clients to be sure one is halting for the right reasons, but I'm not convinced this is an enough constraint.",
