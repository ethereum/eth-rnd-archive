I remember this has been discussed somewhere but can't remember the details - can someone from STEEL definitely say if and when we'll encourage or require running `blockchain_tests_engine` as well?\n\nSo for now we always were tracking passing of `state_tests`, `eof_tests` and `blockchain_tests` only",

Before adding new tests though, try to find if such tests don't exist already (this is usually the same work as figuring out where to physically put new tests). Finally, ping us that you started working on something.\n\nGLHF",
