I listened to ACD but I think I am not yet getting the point of these 3 devnets 😅  \n\nI also have a PR for the InitcodeTransaction https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9561\nWe cannot use 0x05 for tx type since this is used in 7702 authority signing",

How can we then still do code introspection? Or is there another reason why we need the initcode transaction? I can't seem to find this out 😅",
