This is planned to be the last eof-devnet-0 release, from now on we will be moving forward with merging the changes for eof-devnet-1 spec\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/eip7692%40v2.3.0\n\nWe encourage teams to still update to this release before working on devnet-1, as it features a lot of new coverage, which would be good to be green before introducing the breaking devnet-1 changes :).\n\nPls report passing of the tests as usual",
