I'm trying to think of contracts which would need more than 10 different sub-containers. For other purposes we could EXTDELEGATECALL into some other EOF contract and use that contract to deploy those containers. \n(3) Can we also somehow think about TXCREATE here to ship containers from outside (so as tx \"eof creation data\" (or what term we use to call this new TxCreate field of eof containers))? I'm not really seeing the reason why we need these massive container sizes currently (also not for deeply-nested containers, can likely get around this with EXTDELEGATECALL?). Also note that if we want this, we can make this part of EOFv2 where we increase the container size limit\n\nI'm sure I'm missing some obvious point here though why this container size increase is necessary?",
