These are coming from a subset of `ethereum/tests` state tests with legacy code wrapped to become EOF code, wherever that was possible.\n\nMore or less they call all legacy EVM opcodes in EOF contexts and check if they behave as expected (or at least do not cause smoke in the EVM). This is a stop gap solution until `ethereum/tests` are migrated over to EEST (which is ongoing)",
