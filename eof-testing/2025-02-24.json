It seems 7623 has taken down some more tests from the 1559 bunch (intrinsic gas changes), but we can live without these. All the legacy opcodes we intended to test in EOF are still covered 👌 .\n\nSince `eofwrap` has never been disabled for EOF test releases, it doesn't need to be reenabled. The next EOF release should include it (which I'll test on the ipsilon fork in a second, just to be sure)",
