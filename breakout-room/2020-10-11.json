The main changes are i) added a \"type\" field which can be used to allow for future upgrades (maybe even the upper ~4 bits as a flag), ii) an \"extra\" field which is defined to be empty initially empty, but may be used for future features, iii) \"max_gas_price\" instead of \"gas_price\" to improve the bundling UX, and iv) added a brief discussion on how such a tx can be validated (and monitored) efficiently, under security considerations: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2733",
