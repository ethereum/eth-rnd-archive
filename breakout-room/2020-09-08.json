Tentative plane:\n* Split the EIP in two, one for the new transaction/receipt formats and one for the new legacy wrapper transaction type.\n* Remove everything about deprecation of the legacy format from the EIP.\n* Extract the devp2p changes into their own EIP with improved definitions that better align with reality.\n* Change transaction/receipt root merkle path back to an RLP encoded integer\n* Create EIP for JSON-RPC endpoints for new transaction format (naming welcome)\n* Update EIP-2930 to be in line with latest iteration of 2718\n* Update EIP-2711 to be in line with latest iteration of 2718 (and potentially revamp it with help from \u003c@!425279588009246720\u003e)",
