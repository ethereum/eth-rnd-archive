GeneralStateTests/stSStoreTest/sstore_0to0.json - EIP-2929 says for it's interactions with EIP-2200 to redefine SLOAD_GAS from 800 -\u003e 100 (warm read).  EIP-2200 defines some outcomes as SSTORE_RESET_GAS (20k) - SLOAD_GAS.  Does the 2929 spec extend the redefinition to the composite value, so it is now 19900, or do we only look to EIP-2200 without regard to 2929?  So 19200?  Geth and Besu differ in this opinion currently - https://gist.github.com/shemnon/561498b1729ff0229c4563333a6b34a0",
