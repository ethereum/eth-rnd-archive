There is no major opposition to it, but \u003c@!211091239112671234\u003e and others would like to see someone try and move the conversations forward before we begin implementation. On the last ACD call, it seemed like Nethermind was interested in having this EIP, so we were wondering if you had researched it more or started an implementation?",
