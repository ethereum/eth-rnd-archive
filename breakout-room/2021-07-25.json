I'm trying to learn more about the topography of Ethereum nodes and its effect on transaction propagation (delays etc.) I've seen a number of papers claiming Ethereum is heavily clustered, e.g. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3384943.3409418 :\" There are a few critical nodes that have a significant impact on the robustness and vulnerability of the whole system\". Does anyone have any resources around this? The motivating question is to \"how to get a transaction to propagate as fast as possible\".",
