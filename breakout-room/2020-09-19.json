However, they don't replace the extra costs, e.g. mem expansion or value-transfer-cost or create-new-account-cost, or, as you pointed out, the per-byte-cost of extcodecopy. Just the base-cost of 700 is modified.\n\nAnd yes, staticcall to precompiles eip becomes moot, since 2929 already makes it 100. \n\nSame w sload, it becomes either cheaper or more expensive. Check out the eip examples/testcases for more detailed info",
