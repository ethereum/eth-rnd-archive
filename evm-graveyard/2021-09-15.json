He's done a good bit of digging and research into the current use of the opcode in the context of modifying the behavior to be suitable for the pending changes to state management (verkle tries and state-expiry).  Albus can speak for himself, but I believe he has dug up most if not all of the information we need to make a decision on how to proceed.  \"We\" just need to consult with him on any additional questions we'd like answers to and probably make the call on what approach looks best given the data he's dug up.\n\nAlbus, if you'd like to drop links to your work on this for reference that might be helpful.",
