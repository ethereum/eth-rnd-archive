        "content": "I've been thinking about how to get rid of SELFDESTRUCT lately. Would it be a good idea to at least ban deployment of new contracts that contain the opcode? Or, if EIP-2937 (SET_INDESTRUCTIBLE opcode) is implemented, making it mandatory for new contracts to have SET_INDESTRUCTIBLE as its first byte. That way, we won't break existing contracts. A complete removal or neutering could be implemented later.",
