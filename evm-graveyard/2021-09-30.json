        "content": "I infer that \"filled storage slot counters\" may mean: a counter that is stored somewhere in the state that says how many storage slots a contract has filled in...\n\nBut it isn't clear to me how this is related to the incarnation counter approach.\n\nMy understanding of the incarnation counter approach is that we would keep a counter that was incremented each time a contract calls SELFDESTRUCT.  This counter would be used in the function that determines where state is stored in the trie.  The effect is that when a contract calls SELFDESTRUCT all of the old state remains in the trie, but since the incarnation counter gets incremented, that state will no longer end up being accessed since all of the slots will now map to new parts of the trie.  (this all treats hash collisions as things that just don't ever happen)",
