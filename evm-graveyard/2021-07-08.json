        "content": "Quick update: There are a lot of destructible contracts created with `CREATE2`, and so could be conceivably be recreated at the same address, but most of them are false positives (such as Chi Gastoken). See here for details: https://github.com/adompeldorius/selfdestruct-analysis under \"Redeployable contracts\". One way forward is to manually discard most of the false positives and see whats left. Another thing I will do is to analyze the cases where redeployments have happened in the past, which is a much simpler task, but then we will miss the contracts that are able to redeploy but hasn't done it yet.",
