I wonder if any of you'all have seen our work at TrueBlocks: https://trueblocks.io/papers/2022/file-format-spec-v0.40.0-beta.pdf.\n\nWe've literally figured out a very interesting way to fully index every address on any EVM chain deep down into any trace. We call it `every appearance of every address anywhere on the chain`. It works remarkably well. It also has a very important aspect to it where we \"chunk\" the index and in front of each chunk (which consists of thousands of blocks) only then do we generate a bloom filter. This allows our users to download just the bloom filters (from IPFS where they are immutably stored -- about 3 GB) and use the bloom filters to download only the index chunks they need. (A regular user needs another 5-10 GB). Because the system \"pins by default on IPFS\" the index not only gets naturally distributed it also gets naturally pinned. We've only recently gotten to the point were we're confident it works. I'd love to have feedback.\n\nOur work could be incorporated into the node software relatively easy since we purposefully built it against the RPC (so we know it works without being aware of any internals of a particular client).",
