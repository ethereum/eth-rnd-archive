        "content": "Jumpdests are very useful for static contract analysis. Each \"run\" can only start at a jumpdest rather than literally any code location. That can allow for pre-execution optimizations such as only incrementing gas at the exit of a run (or branch point with jumpi).  It can be done without jumpdests, but the analysis is much easier and bug resistant if they are there.",
