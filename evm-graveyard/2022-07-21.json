How expensive that is depends on lots of things that we probably should consider more than we have -- see [What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf)\n\n(A cost model that charges for extension encourages programs to use  to use MSIZE to mark the next free address, but they can do that no matter the cost model.)",
