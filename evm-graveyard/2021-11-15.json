        "content": "Hi, I have been studying the gas stipend in terms of how it functions and the impact of removing it on Solidity methods for transferring Ether such as .send(), .transfer(). and .call(). I have also explored the two possibilities of removing it, that are replacing 2300 with 0 or infinity (forward all the remaining gas), in more depth in regards to implementation. I would be happy to receive any comments or suggestions on what I have done so far.
