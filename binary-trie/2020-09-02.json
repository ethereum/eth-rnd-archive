I'm curious if https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2584 is representative of your latest thoughts on the conversion to a binary trie?  What (if anything) would you want to do on the EIP prior to bringing it up in an ACD call soon",

But the great thing about M3 is that it is very flat data model friendly, does not require bit-twiddling, does not have extensions (anti-feature), and does not use RLP (also anti-feature for the hash trees)",
