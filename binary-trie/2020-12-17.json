I realized I must've been mistaken because we just need to keep the last pre-regenesis block's hexary state root hash to prove the leaves which can then just be inserted into a post-regenesis binary trie.\n\n_If_ our empirical investigations into hexary witnesses for regenesis show us that it's alright, then we should be good to switch the trie format over along with regenesis right?",
