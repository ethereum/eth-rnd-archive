Doing some benchmarks, they impl makes block proving ~16% faster than using the Risc0 optimized sparse-MPT implementation (which was already 20% faster than the stock Reth sparse-MPT). To be fair, Risc0 impl uses the current debug_executionWitness while OpenVM redesigned the guest input to allow these further improvements.\nThere are many cool tricks that I thought were worth explaining in more detail if someone is interested in knowing more about them: https://hackmd.io/@jsign/ethereum-zkvm-openvm-guest-input-and-optimized-mpt",
