I am trying zklighthouse (https://github.com/ethproofs/lighthouse branch ethproofs/zkattester-demo) to follow the proof stream, but the verifier panics and the gossip seems to fail after awhile. The branch seems like it hit EOL (no more commits), and I am not sure where to find more recent code. I need the proof stream for some of my private experiments. Please redirect me if there is a better venue for those questions.",
