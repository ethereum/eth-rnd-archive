    "content": "Also sharing some update reg “performance dashboards” reg proofs.\n\nNew dashboard for proof verification latency: https://eth-act.github.io/zkevm-benchmark-runs/verification/ — this will track proof sizes and proof verification latency, which is relevant for some angles (e.g. network propagation if proofs are verified before doing so). This is run on a machine satisfying EIP-7870 specs for Attester role (I include passmark benchs in the dashboard just to be clear — the current one is 20% less powerful in ST target but devops will help use find a bit better fit soon)\n\nThe proof generation dashboard (https://eth-act.github.io/zkevm-benchmark-runs/repricing/) had some improvements reg being more compact in showing most important metrics without expanding rows, and fixed grouping of results. The runs are still in not ideally optimised prover setups for Zisk (mostly because the CPU/GPU ratio for Zisk isn’t ideal for the 8x5090 machine we have, plus not exploiting the ideal NUMA setup — pandaops is helping with moving towards a better setup)",
