    "content": "In the previous version of ⁨⁨`process_execution_payload`⁩⁩, then node had a different behavior if it was stateless (it only needed to verify the proof), or stateful (it needed to execution the payload).\nExecution proofs were indeed *optional*.\nHowever, with the current version of [process_execution_payload](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/specs/_features/eip8025/beacon-chain.md#modified-process_execution_payload), both the execution (via the execution engine) and the verification (via the proof engine) are mandatory. Why this choice?\n\nMy understanding was a stateless \"light\" node would only have to verify proofs (which is cheap) and not execute the execution block at all.",

(So a stateless node will only need to run single binary - a beacon client - whereas today it needs to run a beacon client and an execution client)?\n\nOr will the proof engine **on the verification side** remain a different binary to run? (So a stateless node will ne to run two binaries: a beacon client and a proof engine)?",
