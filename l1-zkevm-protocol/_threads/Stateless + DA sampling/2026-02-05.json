    "content": "Yeah exactly, though for mandatory proofs, the thinking is that these zk attesters will also be FOCIL includers -- For includers, a mempool would be required to accept transactions. This would mean that getBlobsVx would be usable.\n\nNoting that for a stateless node to have a functioning mempool, they need to be able to check whether a transaction is valid via a mechanism like VOPs",
