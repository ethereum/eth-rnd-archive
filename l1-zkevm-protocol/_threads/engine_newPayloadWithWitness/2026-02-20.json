    "content": "Thanks! Yes, it depends on whether how you're running ethrex. If you run it with the `--generate-witnesses` flag, then the witnesses are generated during payload execution and stored in the DB, we persist the las 128 witnesses, the same as the state we serve as a node. If this flag isn't set, then the witness generations is on-demand and isn't persisted.\n\nEDIT: in addition, witness is persisted RPC ready, so it's read from the DB and directly sent as response",
