We successfully transmitted 500MB of data in less than one second.\nFUll report: https://hackmd.io/nz8dncoPRY6btL_uOQmWpQ?view#IPC-Transport-layer\n\n\nLighthouse + Ethrex (Engine API over IPC vs. TCP), We tested the Lighthouse and Ethrex implementation using IPC rather than TCP. While this significantly reduced latency overhead—positioning it as potentially the fastest transport method in specific environments—within the current Kurtosis environment, the decoupled flow still outperforms the coupled flow.\nFull report: https://hackmd.io/nz8dncoPRY6btL_uOQmWpQ?view#Lighthouse--Ethrex-EngineAPI-over-IPC\n\n\nI have also detailed some concerns regarding \"witness bloat\" in blocks, which I found particularly interesting.\nhttps://hackmd.io/nz8dncoPRY6btL_uOQmWpQ?view#Side-Line\n\n\n\nThe respective codebase link is provided in the report also",
