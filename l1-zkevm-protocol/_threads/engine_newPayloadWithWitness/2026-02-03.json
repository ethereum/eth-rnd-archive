Spamming/Benchmark scripts for case_one (block depth: 0, 8, 32, 64, witness_size: 100mb, 300mb, 500mb). case_one is engine_newPayload + debugExecutionWithness\n\n3. newPayloadWitness impl on GETH + Lighthouse. also logging how much time is take account for JSON serialization and network latency.\n\n4. Spamming/Benchmark scripts for case_two(witness_size: 100mb, 300mb, 500mb)\n\n\nThis is more that enough to get the needed data but I am having problem building a block having 100mb, 300mb or 500mb witness size, I was of the opinion, a block filled with tx interacting with a smart contract would blot up the witness size but from my test it was just 0.3mb and randomly sampling mainnet blocks I get an average witness size of 8mb witness. want to know if my chain of thought regarding this is completely flaw.\n\n\nBench code: https://github.com/developeruche/witness-bench\n\nSample code aiming to build a block of 300mb witness: https://github.com/developeruche/witness-bench/blob/main/spammer/runners/300mb.ts\n\n\nOnce I can tune a block to output a witness of 100, 300 and 500mb the bench report would be ready. \n\nWould love to know if anyone have some thoughts on how I should go about that?",
