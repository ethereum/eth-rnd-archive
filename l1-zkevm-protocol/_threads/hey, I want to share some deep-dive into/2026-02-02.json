I once did an experiment to separate in different guest programs, but there is always noise around input reading/parsing, and other things.\n\nUsually zkVMs allow to benchmark using cycles but those are a red herring when precompiles are involved (such as keccak which is quite relevant for pre-state and post-state root verif/calc).\n\nI'm planning to use some new tooling in Zisk that allows to measure \"real cost\" instead of cycles. This can allow us to have better granularity in measuring inside the complete guest program. \n\nI'll share more when having some numbers!",
