Look here for instance: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/specs/deneb/beacon-chain.md#engine-apis\n\nIt makes sense to me if execution-specs will implement methods listed there. Speaking of a full Engine API, `engine_newPayload` for instance has a `SYNCING` semantics which can't be fully supported by execution-specs.\n\nExecutionEngine methods has a clear semantics that is related to the EL state transition and some additional checks that CL defers to EL. While Engine API is more complicated and relies on the devp2p along to the STF and I think the latter shouldn't be a part of the execution-specs",
