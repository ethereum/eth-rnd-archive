    "content": "[See comment here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4828#discussion_r2720879874) (added below for convenience):\n> The high-level idea was that a node can be spun up with a ProofEngine, an ExecutionEngine, or both. If we only have a ProofEngine, then the ExecutionEngine invocation would be a no-op. Similarly, if we only have an ExecutionEngine, then the ProofEngine call would be a no-op.\n> \n> I agree that this spec doesn't capture this construct well and isn't clear. In regard to options as I see them:\n> \n> - Introduce the stateless validation flag as <@427491045308235776> suggested (I think this exposes implementation details to the spec, which isn't ideal)\n> - Make this clear in the specs via comments\n> - Revert process_execution_payload back to default, and instead add a comment to ExecutionEngine::verify_and_notify_new_payload that it should invoke the ProofEngine (if configured) as well as an external re-execution node (if configured).\n> - Instead of introducing the ProofEngine, we extend the ExecutionEngine with methods for proofs and leave the method implementations as an implementation detail.\n> \n> I tend to be in favour of 3 or 4 but keen to hear others' opinions.",
