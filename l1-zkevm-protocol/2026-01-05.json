I've been building a local `dummy_el` image in my local environment while testing with [Kurtosis](https://github.com/developeruche/prysm/tree/poc/optional-proofs/kurtosis#running-scripts-with-local-images). It's nice to have a common image for testing. I'll update my custom scripts to use `ethpandaops/dummy-el`. Thanks!",
