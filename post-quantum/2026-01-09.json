Two are already presented in the paper 🙂 another nice application of the framework is a new abstraction for grinding in Fiat-Shamir 🙂",

Here's an update on current ethlambda client status:\n\nlean-quickstart integration is currently working, the client already connects to devnet peers and receives new blocks, exposing the latest slot in metrics (as specced in leanMetrics repo).\nNext step is implementing the state transition function.\n\nI'm planning to send weekly updates here, with more frequent updates in https://t.me/ethlambda_client, but let me know if there's a better channel for these.",
