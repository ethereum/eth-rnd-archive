In my case I just looked at what was in the leanSpec repo but this is not really a proper documentation, this is more exchange of information between devs. I don't have a central place where I check/write/modify the documentation except this https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/tree/main/docs",

I know that the current consensus-specs framework works with folders, each corresponding to a fork. But to be honest, I don't really like it.\n\nThe advantages are obviously that everything is directly and super easily accessible. But on the other hand, it requires constant maintenance of legacy code, and the codebase is constantly growing because each new fork brings a new folder... And sometimes, for example, if we update Python, it can require changing everything, including all the old forks.\n\nI would prefer, if possible, to stick to something release-based, so that we have a release per fork, and if we want to go back to an older release, we just have to change the fork. But of course, I'm not the only decision-maker, and I imagine there are many arguments in both directions.\n\nIn any case I think that for the moment, at least for the devnets that are coming, we can concentrate on a single repo and a single folder in it as everything will change very fast. Only `main` branch and the `src` folder count.",
