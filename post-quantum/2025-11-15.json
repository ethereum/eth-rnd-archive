All of this is defined in validator-config.yaml (https://github.com/blockblaz/lean-quickstart/blob/main/local-devnet/genesis/validator-config.yaml)",

PK's genesis generator generates validators.yaml that actually assigns the indices, the nodes are supposed to pick their indices from the file as the `node-key` is passed to the nodes via their `client-cmds` arg script",
