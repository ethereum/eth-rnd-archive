We'd need to explore what vectors should look like, payloads, etc and go from there. I'm not familiar with how the current consensus test vectors look so I have some disconnect there.",

We started by defining the spec for some crypto ingredients because they're independent of the rest, so we can move at our own pace.\n\nBut we're starting to move toward the full consensus spec, step by step.\n\n- We started here with some chain model constants: https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/pull/11\n- I'll then build on this one: https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/pull/15 in order to start completing the spec with the STF and 3SF mini in Python.\n\nOnce we have this, I'll check how to properly test it by establishing reference vectors and cases to test everything as reliably as possible.\n\nThis won't help you much with your question, but we've started doing this here http://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/blob/main/tests/lean_spec/subspecs/poseidon2/test_permutation.py for the Poseidon permutation in order to have a reference test that should test the Poseidon2 behavior completely.
