        "content": "\u003cKlean_b\u003e Hello @Benewagner @tcoratger \nI was looking at the key_gen function for GeneralizedXMSSSignatureScheme and i have 2a question about the RNG parameter.\nRight now key_gen (and the underlying PRF / parameter generation) accepts any R: Rng, which  includes deterministic/test RNGs. I wrote a small test using a simple LCG-based RNG with a fixed seed and I was able to  fully reconstruct the secret key and forge valid signatures just by replaying the same seed and calling key_gen again. Is the intent that callers must always pass a cryptographically secure RNG here, even though the type bound is only R: Rng? If so, would it make sense to tighten this to require a CSPRNG at the type level, e.g.\npub fn key_gen\u003cR: Rng + CryptoRng\u003e(...)\n(or R: CryptoRng + RngCore) to prevent accidental use of weak RNGs? or am I  missing something about why we need to support non-cryptographic RNGs here?",
