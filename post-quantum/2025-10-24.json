Also, Discord is open for everyone to see, transparent and everyone is already in that server. I've been trying to move all discussions except personal dms as much as possible there. If possible I would encourage this one as well, it's open, transparent and you may gain some lurkers that end up being helpful to the protocol. Many of us started just reading on Discord R\u0026D",
