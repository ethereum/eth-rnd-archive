        "content": "**METRICS UPDATES**\n\nToday I am running the default `lean-quickstart` config.\n\n- **Qlean:** exposes metrics by default.  \n- **Ream:** requires the `--metrics` flag to expose metrics.  \n- **Zeam:** requires the `--metrics_enable` flag to expose metrics. Currently, I only see the old Zeam metrics (as shown in the screenshot). There might be a bug with the latest metrics updates. I also pulled the main branch today and checked locally, with the same result.\n\nMy proposal is to add a global `--metrics` flag to `lean-quickstart`, which would activate metrics for all clients. If there are no objections, I can open a PR for that.\n\nOn my side, the finalization didn’t happen. Maybe you’re using updated images; I used the default ones.\n\nI’m satisfied with the initial result 😊 — two clients showing on the dashboard. Now we can investigate the metrics bugs for each client. For example, why Qlean shows three validators instead of one, why Ream doesn’t update the head slot, etc. Once we polish the metrics, monitoring will be easier and more insightful.",
