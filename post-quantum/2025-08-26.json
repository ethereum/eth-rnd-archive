I'm getting the same values as most of the xmss specs PR, but I'm still missing one:\n\n- Mapping: [XMSS Specs PR] -\u003e [hypercube-hashsig-parameters]\n\n*- MESSAGE_LENGTH -\u003e ?*\n- LOG_LIFETIME = 32 -\u003e log_lifetime = 32\n- DIMENSION = 64 -\u003e num_chains = 64\n- BASE = 8 -\u003e chain_length = 8\n- FINAL_LAYER = 77 -\u003e domain_layer = 77\n- TARGET_SUM = 375 -\u003e exact match\n- PARAMETER_LEN = 5 -\u003e exact match\n- TWEAK_LEN_FE = 2 -\u003e exact match\n- MSG_LEN_FE = 9 -\u003e fixed value of 9 in the generator\n- RAND_LEN_FE = 7 -\u003e exact match\n- HASH_LEN_FE = 8 -\u003e exact match\n- CAPACITY = 9 -\u003e exact match\n- POS_OUTPUT_LEN_PER_INV_FE = 15 -\u003e mh_elements_per_invocation = 15\n- POS_INVOCATIONS = 1 -\u003e mh_pos_invocations = 1\n\nThe closest constant to the spec's `MESSAGE_LENGTH` is the generator's `PERMUTATION_WIDTH_MESSAGE_HASH` but it's set to 24 so I'm not sure. \n\nCan I safely assume that `hypercube-hashsig-parameters` works with `MESSAGE_LENGTH` by default?",
