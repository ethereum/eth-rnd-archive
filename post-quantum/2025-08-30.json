Initially, I thought we could just have a spec for the `verify` but with empty implementations for the `key_gen` and `sign` algorithms. But now that we had the reference implementation in Rust, it didn't take much time to translate it to Python, so I just did it. Also, I merged directly because we have lots of tests to cover the implementation and they all pass. Also, this is just a preliminary version and Benedikt/Dmitry will definitely want to take a look at it to fix some details. In any case, it's ready and merged to main. I've created 2 sets of constant parameters: the other for \"production\" like the devnet and another ones for tests so that we can run the test suite and play with it without having to wait a lot for the key generation to happen.\n\nTLDR: you have now the `key_gen`, `sign` and `verify` methods available in the Python.\n\n- The PR about the containers here https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/pull/18 is also merged on main, meaning that we should already have a good number of containers, sufficient for what we want to work with (at least in the short term).\n\n- Same about the toy proposer selection algo: https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/pull/19.\n\n- Networking subspec skeleton was also merged here https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/pull/20 so that we have something to play with and continue working.\n\nIn any case, don't hesitate to submit PRs or change anything if necessary. Nothing is definitive of course so that this is really a moving repo.",
