But this will require some discussions to make this properly as we never touched this topic in the discussion.\n\nI'll have a detailed look at the PR asap but if you can please feel free to check it as well 🙂",

Alongside fast finality, rainbow staking is one of the key discussion topics for EF researchers in Cambridge during the retreat Oct 7-9.\n\nI'm thinking of having a lean consensus call in November dedicated to rainbow staking.

Something that could be nice is to start discussins/merging some primitives that don't affect the rest of the code, so we can start preparing and leave the field open for future modifications based on developments.\n\nSmall question: will this channel become the one for lean consensus interop discussions as a general rule (in which case it's relevant to discuss something other than post-quantum here), or is it intended solely for post-quantum matters?",
