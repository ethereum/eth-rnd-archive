This would make it much easier to test accuracy and compatibility against the Zig implementation. At the moment, generating keys with a 2^18 lifetime is quite slow on older Macs.\nDoesn't changing the ``key_gen()`` `'s 3rd param to other value work? From the hash-sig readme this would be changing `T::LIFETIME`` to 10:\n\n```\n\nlet (pk, sk) = T::key_gen(\u0026mut rng, 0, T::LIFETIME as usize);```",

The max lifetime (T::LIFETIME) for everything we test should be 2^32. the activation time can be much shorter.",

I know, I can change the zig implementation also to do the same thing as the reference implementation. I was just wondering if there is a simpler way to compare.",
