But this will require some discussions to make this properly as we never touched this topic in the discussion.\n\nI'll have a detailed look at the PR asap but if you can please feel free to check it as well 🙂\nEveryone, the rainbow staking PR is opened as draft, with the intent to be, as stated, a discussion starter. However, we also find this to be a good occasion to set the foundation for integrating the Validator-to-Staker paradigm change, and the delegation primitives, into lean consensus. \n\nReiterating what @tcoratger wrote above, we strongly believe that it would be of value to identify which delegation / rainbow staking parts can be defined early in the lean consensus specification process, get them merged and set the stage for future developments (even if it's only types or terminology or design decisions in some parts)\n\nThis being said, I welcome comments on the existing PR, so we can advance towards something concrete",

Give me a few hours/days and I'll check that is depth and review the PR so that we can merge asap. I need to read the EIP/doc as well to think about it more carefully.",
