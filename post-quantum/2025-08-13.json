Is this something we consider due to special constraints in local devnet environments or is this technique supposed to be applied more broadly eventually?\nIMO it may make sense to apply this trick more broadly. If someone is attesting from a weak device (e.g. a Raspberry Pi) then it suffices to store the seed plus a \"slice\" of the Merkle tree. The height of the slice is parametrisable, but somewhere in the middle (i.e. half way between the leaves and the root) probably gives a good tradeoff between storage and key rederivation latency.",
