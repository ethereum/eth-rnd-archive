As I don't think we have a combined specification yet, just the 2 proposals by Ream/Zeam which specify the topics so far\nWe just started discussing the container specs which are not confirmed yet, but once done it should also be used for gossipsub, same as how beacon specs does this.\n\nSo yes I think it’s safe to start implementing Block and Attestation gossip topics but mindful the message may change.",

        "content": "\u003cunnawut\u003e re: **@RobertoSaltini**\n\u003e Hi all, I was thinking that it might be possible to test the performance of PQ signature aggregation without using any consensus protocol. \n\nAside from simplifying things, this would ensure that the performance of PQ sig. aggregation is measured in isolation and is not influence by other components such as consensus.\n\nHere is how I think this could be achieved.\n- Time is divided into slots as usual.\n- We have an injective function m(s) to map a slot s to a message.\n- At the beginning of each slot s, each node signs the the message m(s).\n- Aggregation is then performed during slot s.\n- At the beginning of the next slot s+1, each node records data about the quality of the aggregates that they received.\n- The information recorded by each node is then aggregated together.\nSo actually this is what was first proposed in the 1st interop call. But by the 2nd call we leaned towards incorporating a fork choice. Iirc one of the main arguments was that this part is approximately already a fork choice and implementing an actual fork choice might actually be more practical than coming up with this stack.\n\n\u003e - Aggregation is then performed during slot s.\n\u003e - At the beginning of the next slot s+1, each node records data about the quality of the aggregates that they received.\n\u003e - The information recorded by each node is then aggregated together.",
