But by the 2nd call we leaned towards incorporating a fork choice. Iirc one of the main arguments was that this part is approximately already a fork choice and implementing an actual fork choice might actually be more practical than coming up with this stack.\n\n\u003e - Aggregation is then performed during slot s.\n\u003e - At the beginning of the next slot s+1, each node records data about the quality of the aggregates that they received.\n\u003e - The information recorded by each node is then aggregated together.\nSorry for not making the 2nd call.\n\nAs far as I can see, there is no fork-choice in the approach that I proposed. If we assume that clocks are roughly synchronised (which we assume anyway), then the approach that I proposed ensures perfect consensus, even regardless of network synchrony. This is because, essentially, at each slot `s` each node decides value `s` and signs a message derived from that value.\n\nTo me, this \"perfect\" consensus is the main benefit of this approach. If we use a Gasper/3SF fork-choice, then high network latency or partitions could very well cause nodes to have different views of the chain, leading them to sign different messages for the same slot, which therefore cannot be aggregated. This would impact the measured performance of the signature aggregation process.\n\nIf we want to test such a scenario (nodes sign different messages), the \"perfect consensus\" approach allows us to do so by using the node id, in addition to the slot number, to derive the message to be signed. Importantly, we can do this in a controlled manner.",
