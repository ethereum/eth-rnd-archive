I’m asking so I can apply the corresponding updates in hash-zig. @Benewagner @tcoratger\nFrom what I understand, mostly the encoding scheme and the aggregation part differ. leanMultisig also doesn't use tweaks. The core XMSS parameters are more or less similar. Verification in leanMultisig happens inside a proof.",
