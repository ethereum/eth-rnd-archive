        "content": "I think it would make a lot of sense to move some types from `consensus-specs` directly into `ethereum-types`. As I understand it, the `execution-specs` team started out with those types internal to their repo and moved them into a separate repo / dependency as `ethereum-types` so that it can serve the purpose of housing their types. If it makes sense to move the SSZ types over there, and any others, that would be quite a beneficial change to try to centralize a lot of common Ethereum Python spec types which can then be imported as a dep to `consensus-specs`, `leanSpec`, and is already the case for `execution-specs`. This would help quite a bit with the current fragmentation and help centralize for readers / implementers where to add new types and import from for specs. If moving out of current consensus-specs doesn't make sense, then at least have leanSpecs start to use it. \n\ncc: \u003c@689161464829050960\u003e \u003c@592004585506340885\u003e",
