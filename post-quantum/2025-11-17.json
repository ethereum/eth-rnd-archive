The old repo still exists (so that the references to it remain valid, e.g., in the academic paper) but will no longer be maintained. All optimizations and changes that we make from now will be in the new one under leanEthereum. It is here (https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSig). You can now also update all references that you have to point to this instead the b-wagn one.",
