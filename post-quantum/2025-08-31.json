Initially, I thought we could just have a spec for the verify but with empty implementations for the key_gen and sign algorithms. But now that we had the reference implementation in Rust, it didn't take much time to translate it to Python, so I just did it. Also, I merged directly because we have lots of tests to cover the implementation and they all pass. Also, this is just a preliminary version and Benedikt/Dmitry will definitely want to take a look at it to fix some details. In any case, it's ready and merged to main. I've created 2 sets of constant parameters: the other for \"production\" like the devnet and another ones for tests so that we can run the test suite and play with it without having to wait a lot for the key generation to happen.\n\nTLDR: you have now the key_gen, sign and verify methods available in the Python.\n\n- The PR about the containers here https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/pull/18 is also merged on main, meaning that we should already have a good number of containers, sufficient for what we want to work with (at least in the short term).\n\n- Same about the toy proposer selection algo: https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/pull/19.\n\n- Networking subspec skeleton was also merged here https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/pull/20 so that we have something to play with and continue working.\n\nIn any case, don't hesitate to submit PRs or change anything if necessary. Nothing is definitive of course so that this is really a moving repo.\nAmazing!  I’m sure you are going to speak about the spec at length next Friday, but if you are interested in doing a line by line walkthrough on the Wed call, that would be incredible",

The code here is quite big to do a strict line by line but for sure I'll do something like this to walk through the code in details :)",

But we do not recommend client teams to make their own implementation which could be risky from a security perspective. The best would be to rely on the Rust implementation or bindings.\n\nFor Poseidon:\n- Reference code: https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3/tree/main/poseidon2\n- Written spec: https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/323\n\nFor the rest:\n- More documentation: https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/tree/main/docs\n\nBut throughout the code, I hope to have put enough documentation (I put a lot of it) so that everything is understandable by reading the codebase.",

So we are in a fast iteration mode and a lot of things change day after day. But of course if you find some doc or some links missing please let me know or open a PR, I will review it directly 🙂",

Not a design doc.  Perhaps my question can be phrased in a different way. There's already a second devnet and for those not involved every day it's pretty hard if not impossible to catch up or even have a clue besides of a high level roadmap. It's not a complain at all. I'm pretty sure it's the same with ePBS. Eventually things will mature and will be easy to onboard existing CL clients",
