I have just finished a benchmarking framework that allows us to measure key generation time and key size for different lifetimes. With this framework, we can produce the \"key size vs. time\" and \"key generation time vs. time\" plots that were requested.\n\nI've already collected our first data point: 2^10 lifetime takes 12 seconds to generate, and 2^18 lifetime is currently running.\nMy proposed next step is to:\n\nMy proposed next step is to systematically benchmark lifetimes from 2^13 (~8 hours) up to 2^26 (~5 years) to give us the complete scaling picture.\n\nWhat are the specific lifetimes that would be most valuable for the team to see benchmarked first?\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1398301046085914745/1405537536956305428/Screenshot_2025-08-14_at_13.24.42.png?ex=689f3056\u0026is=689dded6\u0026hm=9d1ffebfa7b03224a67e65962c14baddc16e5e4257d5c21a138364f3027b9465\u0026\n@Klean_b could you please document this in a hackmd document and present this in tomorrow's call?",
