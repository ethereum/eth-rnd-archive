I think the major points for review are:\n\n1. `VALIDATOR_REGISTRY_LIMIT: 4096` same as zeam's impl\n\n2. `MAX_HISTORICAL_BLOCK_HASHES: 262144` so it's enough for 12 days with 4s slot time\n\n3. The justifications dict becomes a List + Bitlist\n\n4. The rest are minor like `str -\u003e Bytes32`, `int -\u003e uint64`, removing `state.config`, etc.",
