        "content": "Agreed that there's reasons to add more to a fork if its adding minor delays, the question is how much the delay is going to be though + how many unknown unknown exist that could add more delays. If the answer to both are low (especially in the order of 1 month) -\u003e then it sounds prudent to ship it with. If the answer to both are high, then it doesn't really make sense and it can instead go in the fork after. \n\nKeeping with the BPO analogy, I think 6/12 mo is too wide a variance, that much time could fit theoretically 1.5-2x the number of large features. Instead 6/8 mo sounds more realistic if we're to keep faster shipping cadence. It allows us to account for minor changes that are benefitial and useful, but doesn't give us so much time that we jam massive new features in.",
