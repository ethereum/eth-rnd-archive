The idea is the producer would then select from aggregates theyve received to pick the most profitable ones to include. That is, the attestations with the most not yet included participants. Good to note that the protocol lets you include duplicates so if you have two good attestations with some overlap but a lot of uniques, it could very well be worth including both. \n\nIn more structured approaches to aggregation like Handel, the protocol aggregates stepwise in such a way to avoid overlaps entirely. \n\nIts important to note that a strategy in which all participants aggregate and rebroadcast the small aggregates as that go, will result in disorder -- tons of non-aggregable small attestations.",
