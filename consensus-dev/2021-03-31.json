        "content": "I have another question about accounting on ETH2. It is my understanding (and this may be wrong) that the kind of things that are being considered now instead of (slot, block) votes are modifications to fork choice as in \u003c@!555483069038198827\u003e's proposal https://ethresear.ch/t/high-confidence-single-block-confirmations-in-casper-ffg/8909. This may allow us to attenuate the problem of voting for the wrong head + target on slot 0 of an epoch, since this enforces (block,slot)-behavior at least when slot is divisible by 32. The problem of bad head votes on late blocks in the middle of the epoch would still be there. What worries me is that under good p2p conditions, block proposer's currently are encouraged to submit their blocks after 4 seconds, they can continue listening for longer on the subnet trying to include more attestations or better aggregates until their block is full (or even after if they decide to include better aggregates). So I wander if there is anything wrong with the proposal of rewarding block proposers by the number of votes their blocks receive as well as the number of attestations included https://ethresear.ch/t/reward-proposers-by-received-votes/8588. At least this would give a direct incentive to submit the block earlier, rather than just the loose incentive in that \"if you are very late it may not be included\", since currently they have about 8 seconds of slack.",
