Here's one of by bad head votes: I should have voted in this block\nhttps://beaconcha.in/block/413307#overview\nbut I didn't,  and so didn't the approximately 2200 validators that were supposed to vote for that block. That block in the explorer shows 19 votes, however there are a couple of double votes, 17823 and   24740 are counted twice.",

        "content": "That leaves 17 unique votes, out of the ~2200 expected. If you look at the deposit address from some of the voters you will find that some of them are from the same owner 17814, 17823 for example. Some are from the same deposit address as the proposer: 27310, 27379, 27385 for example. So it's fair to expect that there are less than 8 actual validator clients that voted for this block. Now my node received this block at the 9 seconds mark, and it is fair to say that most probably the ~2200 guys that were supposed to vote on this block did as well.  Now 9 seconds is pretty bad if you need to attest, but it's more than fine if you are proposing in the next block, indeed the proposer of 413308 (the next block) got it on time so it built on it, hence our bad vote. So in this situation, you have about ~2200 guys that are penalized for voting on the wrong head (getting 19.7KGwei instead of the usual 40K at the time) but also the few that were close (and probably running on the same box) as the proposer are also penalized because of the low participation, they earned 15KGwei (notice that the penalty for low participation is worse than the penalty for bad vote, that's a good one for the protocol!). I feel like in these situations (or that of slot 0) honestly attesting validators shouldn't take the hit.  Moreover, it seems like the next proposer should also build not on the previous valid block, but on the previous valid block that he got in less than 4 seconds (yeah, this seems wrong as well, tons of other problems if we do this). Anyway, stays here my cry.",
