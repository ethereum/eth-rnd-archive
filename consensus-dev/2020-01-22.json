The contract and FV work is now for public review. I'll be explicitly requesting review from some teams/individuals and will make a call out for it in my next blog post",

And if something similar comes in for committees I think this would become more important, given the much smaller size of a committee Vs. the entire validator pool.\n\nMy mind wanders to future failures of software, or hacks of large staking services, that results in 15% of total validators slashed.  If they lose 50% of their balance it's going to be a much harder for the next person to decide to deposit, whereas if they lose 10% of balance value I think it would be less of a drag on adoption.  Given that such an attack wouldn't be network-threatening (in phase 0, anyway) it can be hard to sell the harshness of the punishment.",
