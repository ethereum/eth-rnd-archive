        "content": "In as much as I agree that a standard in the metrics will help in this scenario, on the other hand I feel like any sort of standard of this kind goes somewhat against the unwritten laws of decentralization. The protocol depicted in the specs is the minimum in which clients need to agree, and it seems to me that as long as the conform to this, they should be allowed to do whatever they want. Including anything not strictly necessary in the specs would be a violation of this principle of freedom. Let the users decide what client they want to use. Once we start including unnecessary standards, it becomes hard to decide what's required and what's not",

Most individual stakers aren’t using metrics or are just using a dashboard supplied by their client and could easily switch to a different dashboard. \nFor staking services having some common metrics is useful to monitor multiple types of clients in one dashboard but it will only provide an overview level. The more detailed performance measures that can provide early warning of problems are inherently client specific. Again though creating a dashboard isn’t typically the main barrier. Integrating into deployment automation, ensuring you have enough experience working through issues and generally building up enough confidence in the use and configuration of the client is what takes most of the time. \n\nSo I’m not against metrics but it’s only one small part. And if we standardise all the parts so clients are completely drop in compatible we’ve lost a lot of the benefit of having multiple clients because now they all have to be essentially the same.",

But tailored guides could be made building on the install guides to then show how to switch to different clients if you used that particular guide for initial setup.",
