Meaning, during phase 0-1.5, we have an artificial incentive to keep validating, but from phase \u003e1.5 such incentive will be removed, and in which a reoccurance of a bug wiping 2-3% of peole's assets, this time they would choose to withdraw their funds and go seek better financial instruments to make up their losses",
