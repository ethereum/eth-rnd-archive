Only if there are fewer than SLOTS_PER_EPOCH * TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE = 4096 validators in total will the committee size be reduced below TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE.\" (https://benjaminion.xyz/eth2-annotated-spec/phase0/beacon-chain/configuration/#misc)\n\nemphasis mine. that sounds okay for phase 0, but let's talk about how that works out in phase 1.\n\nthis is not final yet, but it looks like INITIAL_ACTIVE_SHARDS is 64. I also surmise each shard would be transitioned by one committee. is this reasonable to suppose?\n\nif yes, what would happen to shards if the validator count fell below INITIAL_ACTIVE_SHARDS * TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE = 8192? shouldn't we maintain 64 committees no matter what to ensure all shards will keep transitioning?",

        "content": "**Bob**\n\u003c@291925846556540928\u003e The above discussion is somewhat confusing. One person states the need for INITIAL_ACTIVE_SHARDS * TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE = 64 x 128 = 8192 and another states a need for that times 32 = 262,144. Obviously, 8192 would mean every validator would be used in every epoch, highly undesirable. Conversely, with 262,144 validators, each validator would only be used roughly 8 times a day (255 epochs / 32), a high degree of underutilization. Perhaps the fundamentals of EIP 1559 need some re-thinking: what reward structure is needed to entice potential validators to lock up their ether? How many validators are needed for a reasonable stable? Perhaps around 24,000 to 32,000? I have some thoughts on how to address these kind of questions, but this is not the right forum.",
