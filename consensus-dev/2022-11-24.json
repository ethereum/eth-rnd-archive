        "content": "Hey everyone, hope this is the appropriate channel to ask those questions:\n1. Is this right: you can exit a validator by signing a `VOLUNTARY_EXIT` message with your validation key and broadcasting it to the consensus layer. Whenever a validator has finished the exit queue, it is considered withdrawable and a certain amount of withdrawals are processed at every block (with a sweep method if this is approved https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3079).\n2. Where can I find information about skimming? Especially regarding the frequency of this process, will all validators of the network be skimmed at every block? Or is it a per day process? How often can the withdrawal_credentials expect to receive consensus-level rewards?\n3. Can you explain the 2 CL hard forks limitation of pre-signed `VOLUNTARY_EXIT` messages (mentioned here  https://hackmd.io/@lido/BkxRxAr-o) ? Imagine an entity like lido wants its operators to exit all validators X years after their generation. Would it be safe to ask the node operators to upload a pre-signed exit message for the epoch in now + X years when they upload their deposit data to the lido contract? Or would this be inefficient as hard forks could make them invalid?\n4. I have seen discussions about a dual-exit model where withdrawal_credentials would also be able to trigger the exit, especially this one https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/1578, (via a similar process than how deposits work I suppose), is there anything planned for this? What would be required to start designing / implementing this?\nI will be more than happy to help creating a public FAQ documentation on these topics if there is not already one available!\nThx!",
