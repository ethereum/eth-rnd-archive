Also there are really bad worst cases that look to be fundamental. We have decided to move on from this design and just accept to use the churn, as discussed here https://notes.ethereum.org/@fradamt/maxeb-consolidation. The downside is that time-to-full-consolidation is long, the upside that it's simple and there are clear, acceptable guarantees on what happens when signing a consolidation (you lose 256 epoch of rewards for the withdrawal period, and nothing more)",
