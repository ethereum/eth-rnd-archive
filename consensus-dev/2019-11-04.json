I was thinking of some sort of flattening, where the returns at 16K validators is brought down (from ~23% to ~15% perhaps) and at 1M validator is brought up (from ~3% to ~7%).  This retains the incentive but doesn't give people unrealistic expectations if they see the early returns and expect similar as everyone piles in, and doesn't return so little that they want to stop validating (especially in early phases where there is no way to cash out)",

If the absolute rate is low (down at the ~2% level) then 2x better returns isn't necessarily as enticing as it would be if the absolute rate is higher (e.g. ~5%).\n\nThere's also the reality that the hardware and operational costs are going to be flat rate, and so could cap the number of validators well before the 1 million number.  If the lowest return is ~5%, and of that say 3% is swallowed in costs, you would only need the rate to increase to ~7% to double your profits.",

If we take monthly costs to be $30 (this can, of course, be argued over and depends on the $ value of ETH but just for the purposes of illustration) then any number of validators over ~192K would result in all validators having a negative return.\n\nI would hope that the model would allow for up to a much higher number of validators (512K? 1MM?) with some sort of return (even if minimal).  Otherwise it seems that the model is building in a low cap on the number of validators that can join, and that doesn't seem to be beneficial to the network",
