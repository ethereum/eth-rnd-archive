Been looking for someone to confirm this because we're trying to finalize our updated transaction confirmation logic. \n\nFollow up question: what is the likelihood of an inadvertent or malicious user activated fork? Specifically, in what scenarios could a reorg past 2 a finalized epoch occur.\n\n**2 thoughts I had:**\n\n1. Is it feasible that mainnet is different enough from goerli based on data size that the CL clients can't all stay in sync? Given it seems there is a reasonably even distribution of CL clients, if one or more client is borked could this lead to an inadvertent reorg?\n\n2. Could a malicious group economically decide to eat the slashing cost on enough validators they control to F with the merge if they have a large short position on?\n\nI haven't seen these 2 things discussed much and was wondering in particular if #2 is plausible given the ETHPoW camp seems to be intent on trying to cause issues.\n\nEDIT: apologies if this should be in \u003c#692062809701482577\u003e. Feel free to chasten me. Figured I'd reply in the same context.",
