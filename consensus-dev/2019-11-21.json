However, with the outlined benefits I am convinced it is worth the discussion.\nPlease take a quick look, I would like to discuss this during the implementers call tomorrow.",

The calls in the networking spec enable the retrieval of blocks to do such a sync. I'm not certain if there is a description of the methods other than that document. I can ask on the call tomorrow.\n\nBeyond that, we do need to specify a state sync, but it does not have to be available at the initial releaseof the protocol as validators are expected to serve historic blocks for the weak subjectivity period (at least 3+ months worth). Worth opening that up soon though if anyone wants to take a stab at it.",

This is a trade-off between bandwidth and computation cost of attestation dissemination.",
