There is an issue with `net_version` on geth's master branch, which brought this up. And it seems like `eth_chainId` should generally be preferred",

        "content": "`net_version` is incorrect, though it won't matter for Görli or MainNet.  `net_version` actually reports the network ID, whereas `eth_chainId` report the chain ID.  In every public ethereum network I know of, network ID and chain ID are the same.  They are however different in many private chains and are different for ETC mainnet.\n\nHistorically there was only `net_version` so confusingly it used to return the chain ID in some clients for compatibility with MetaMask but `eth_chainId` has been around for a year or two now and MetaMask switched to it so `net_version` now typically returns the network ID like it should.\n\nBottom line if you care which chain is in use, use `eth_chainId` - if you care which p2p network its connected to (not sure why you would - ETH and ETC use the same devp2p), use `net_version`.",
