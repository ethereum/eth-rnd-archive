You def don't want to make people complacent and give the impression that a bailout would even be considered in such a scenario or you can just forget about client diversity as people will just converge on the one that has accrued the biggest traction/has the best UX and resiliency of the network be damned.Bugs happen",

But it quickly becomes very difficult to argue about which products are \"in\" and which are \"out\" of the compensated entities, given the cost of audits and the pace of change of the software.\n\nThe best answer is to insulate the components from each other, so that (for example) a bug in a beacon node _cannot_ create a slashable offence because it's the signer that protects against that.  This would allow a reduction in the surface that needs to be protected against, and more chance of being able to provide some sort of limited set of guarantees.",
