        "content": "does the engine API \"sync to head\" process follow a fundamentally different flow when the EL/CL DBs are more than a couple hours behind head?  If for example I stop the CL and EL for say a day and then start them both up?  I'm seeing an issue w/ geth (1.13.2 in PBSS) and teku (23.9.1) not being able to fully sync to head but it only seems to happen if the two nodes are on a chain that's more than 12h or so old, or at least that's the pattern I'm seeing at the moment.  Annoyingly everything seems to work on a restart (e.g. to add more logging).\n\nThe reason this comes up is that we usually start new nodes by seeding them w/ a snapshot taken from a synced to head node that is backed up a couple times a day, but since I'm still experimenting w/ PBSS the snapshot is older than usual (say 20h behind head instead of 8 or so).  I'll collect logs once I get a better idea of what's going on, but in the meantime wanted to understand if there's a fundamental difference in control flow under this scenario.",
