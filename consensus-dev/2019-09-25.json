        "content": "**timbeiko**\nHey all, \n\nSorry to jump in here, but EthMagicians is organizing an Ethereum Roadmap session on the first day of devcon. The goal for the afternoon is to discuss the Eth1, Eth2 and Eth1-\u003e2 transition roadamps and try and form working groups to address some of the challenges. \n\nIt’d be great to have people from the Eth2 clients there for the relevants parts of the sessions, so I wanted to share here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVgW29GMyYfKkTu5Bh4LuF90uETXG33Kju4WH2o9DW8/edit#heading=h.dtc8c6tzhdu6\n\nAlso, we’re looking for a few people to help lead/facilitate the discussion, so if you’re interested in doing that, please ping me. Thanks!",
