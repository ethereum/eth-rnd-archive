We will require 5 slots to get a timely source and 32 for the target. Besides just making the source flag not automatic as it is now this choice seems arbitrary to me. Is there anotger reason for the shorter inclusion required on source rather than target?",

It looks as though at least 1% of votes will not be considered timely, and for servers that take more time to generate attestations (poor network connectivity? lower CPU resources?) the drop can be significantly higher.\n\n(Data was taken for a fixed set of epochs a week or two ago.)\n\nThis does seem somewhat of a retrograde move.  What would the impact be on the network if the source vote turns up after 6 slots, rather than 5?",
