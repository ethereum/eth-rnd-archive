        "content": "Hello, I figured I'd ask here before going to sleep, it's late for me to start digging this up. But the short version is that I refactored tracking of justification in our forkchoice, and forgot to account for the wall clock in spec tests. and they passed anyway. This is surprising to  me: in particular, my changes involve moving the function `should_update_justified_checkpoint` and without the wall clock this function would always return true. So I don't know how could I have passed balancing attack tests. So the concrete question: is there a test-vector that includes a balancing attack that should be prevented by not updating if the block is late in the epoch and not a descendant of the current justified point? I can't figure out now how could I have passed such a test without the wall clock in the testing implementation.",
