I noticed that the pubkey used for withdrawal credentials is not explicitly a different pubkey, so to get security fully right (I imagine people will look back at articles like these as reference like!), can you please make it explicit that you should use a different key than the regular pubkey used everywhere else? See deposit contract spec: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_deposit-contract.md#withdrawal-credentials Thanks!",
