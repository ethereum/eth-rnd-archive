I do tend to think though this is unlikely the reason and I would put my money on inertia and unwillingness to change a multi-million setup that is already working. \nI also think that given the high concentration of staked eth, popularizing and trying to convince the small stakers of switching clients is a waste of time and resources, as several have mentioned, just convincing a couple of large pools of using different clients would make this problem disappear, it does not need to involve the community as a whole",

        "content": "\u003e Are these shops running custom clients?\nSome of them really want certain features in, so it makes it easy for them to contribute or change parts of the code as they need until the feature is done, and easier to contribute in a language one is fluent in. Many of them have contributed to the codebase for quality of life improvements and important features\n\u003e  Aren't the public APIs the same for all clients?\nUnfortunately not. Prysm has its own set of APIs that it has supported for a while, with a pretty different schema than the standard ones. We do support the standard API, but all our tooling uses our own APIs which use protobuf/grpc. Many institutional users write their own tooling that leverage these grpc go bindings to accomplish many tasks, including but not limited to: key management workflows, remote signers, monitoring, writing Go programs to instrument Prysm, etc. We spent a great deal of time making the software ideal to run in a Kubernetes setup, which is what a lot of these folks use, especially with Go/gRPC/k8s tooling\n\nLike Potuz said, the biggest reason is likely inertia, but I wanted to clarify that there are more reasons why people picked Prysm than just having a web UI and building an early community",
