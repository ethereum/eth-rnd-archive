        "content": "Validator’s withdrawal addresses are controlled by the external services and hence, If the restaker get slashed then external services (EigenLayer) just takes note of the slashing in the withdrawal contract and when restaker withdraws from beacon chain, the contract would first apply the External Layer slashing and then give restaker the remaining. So there is no double spending that can happen.\nThe introduction of execution_balance is an effort to bring information into BC about how the BC stake is being used outside the BC in external services. The beacon chain rewards validator because they provide security to the protocol which is underlined by their stake. So if a validator’s stake is externally slashed then ideally beacon chain should scale their rewards according to the security they provide, which now can be done with the introduction of execution_balance.",

        "content": "Coming to the correlation penalty on the newly introduced execution_balance, we have three cases: \n1) Slashing across AVS and AVS\n- This is the case where, validator 1 and validator 2 commit slashing offense on the external service, and have their execution_balance decreased on BC. This case has nothing to do with BC but external service, and hence correlation of these slashings on execution_balance is not required. External service is responsible to undertake such correlation penalties.\n2) Slashing across BC and BC.\n- This is already in place, as when validators commit slashing offence on BC by violating GHOST or CASPER rules, effective_balance is decreased and correlation is done on effective_balance. Nothing changes here.\n3) Slashing across AVS and BC.\n- This is the case where validator 1 commits slashing offence on AVS but is honest on BC(slashing accounted in execution_balance variable) and validator 2 commits slashing offence on BC but is honest of external service (slashing accounted in effective_balance). This is the tricky and gray area.\n- Logically, since validator 1 has not broken any BC rules concerning GHOST and CASPER, it doesn’t make sense to correlate the slashing of validator 1 in execution_balance to validator 2 in effective_balance.",
