This is mostly calldata, no state changes, in the happy case. That already wins you some scaling on Eth1. But if you had more blockspace to put the calldata on, you can have a lot more throughput. Eth2 shards add that extra capacity that so many L2s could use.",

However, consensus is not the bottleneck, so this does not mean you can in total execute more transactions. Execution is the bottleneck, therefore the total of L1+one rollup tps must be bounded to ~15 tps worth of work, or you have to sacrifice decentralization to get more tps.\nIn other words, rollups don't provide scaling, they provide execution sharding.",

But would you be able to have a single optimistic rollup with 500 tps without sacrificing decentralization? No, because consensus is not the bottleneck! Users of that rollup still need to run a full node to validate that rollup's txs, and executing those txs is the bottleneck.\nHowever, you could take these 500 tps and split them up into 64 rollups that are bounded to ~15 tps worth of gas.",
