And the reverse if a newer BN gets config from an older one (can be done via `config/spec` endpoint for example)\nWe've had similar issues raised from \u003c@144468805697929216\u003e where teku stopped providing a specific value that it needed due to a regression, but this is a spec based thing now.",
