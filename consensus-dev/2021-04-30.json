The biggest difference in rewards is first and foremost who get to reap slashings (which is random), who gets to produce blocks (which is also random) - also, clients are probably adjusting over each release to improve performance where it matters based on network growth etc - ie lighthouse fixing a block production delay will increase the profits of their users a bit etc",

        "content": "In addition, some bugs in one client affect others, eg. Some clients not broadcasting attestations for unknown blocks affect those clients that attest fast while it doesn't those that deliberately delay attestations. I suppose having a good measurement of client performance is possible, but the only reference to Teku performing better that I know is from a tweet of Ben Edington and the y axis was misleading to say the least",

I’ll have to let Ben explain further.",
