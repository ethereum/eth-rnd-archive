LMD-GHOST without committees and with view-merge has great properties under full participation, and I think one can easily modify it with vote expiry to satisfy some practically sufficient definition of dynamically availability (though maybe not the standard one). Good thing is, this means that, if we can get everyone voting in one slot, at least this part of our problems is solved",

        "content": "Since there has been a lot of confusion about this, let me just clarify what Goldfish is and what it is not. It is a protocol which satisfies reorg-resilience, dynamic availability and accountable safety with optimal adversarial resilience and can give fast confirmations , all properties we want, and *the available component* is very easily applicable to Ethereum. That said, the latter is “too synchronous” in a way in which LMD-GHOST is not (the tradeoff being that it allows for committees, which LMD-GHOST doesn’t really do, as mentioned in the previous message). For that reason, I think it is quite unlikely it would actually be considered  for use on Ethereum (unless we start seeing a lot of short ex-ante reorgs by very large staking pools and really need a fast response, which doesn’t seem realistic). Moreover, while it combines available chain and finality gadget securely, that part is not as easily applicable to Ethereum.",

Once that is out of the picture, one strategy could be to have a second layer of aggregation, e.g. 32 larger subnets, each one having 1/32 of the validator set in it, and further aggregating the first layer aggregates. Basically, each top-level subnet would gossip the same messages as today’s global beacon_aggregate_and_proof topic, roughly 1024 aggregates, and those would be further aggregated before going into global gossip",

But increasing slot times significantly is going to be tough (possibly mitigated by increasing the gas limit significantly?)\n\nSubnets also take time to establish, from my understanding, so continually reconfiguring them could be painful.  I don't have any detailed knowledge of the p2p layer though so not sure if that is the case.",
