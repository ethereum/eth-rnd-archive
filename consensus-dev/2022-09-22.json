Alert if your binaries are not being downloaded by the proportion you would expect given the graffitis you're seeing. So if new version graffitis usually grow at 2x downloads and something is off there, throw an alert. Idea here is to thwart a supply-chain attack. I think it'd be relatively easy for the maintainers of the Arch User Repository consensus client packages to perform this attack, for example.",
