        "content": "We can proceed these debates forever as you can always pull some new detail that I will need to spend time to find a way to solve it. It's not productive. Let's lift this discussion to a higher level. My point is that the attacks are known and PoS is a fantastic protocol for figuring out who is responsible for it when we have an extremely high participation rate. In other words, if you have all the facts (not only on-chain facts) on the table you can identify which chain is made by using an attack. However, what you are trying to prove is the opposite. You are trying to pull the details that would bust this core theory. In my understanding, you can't succeed. So what you can do now - come with a theory that proves a possibility to pull out of the blue a valid (in your terms) alternative chain without using any attack, so then one can't justify which chain is made by an attacker based on all the facts (not only on-chain facts). You need to prove that it's possible to make an alternative chain without anyone cheating. But if you can prove this, then you bust the entire PoS.",
