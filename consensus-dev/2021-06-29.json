It appears that both Lodestar and Prysm changed their `SyncCommittee` spec tests to point to `SyncAggregate` for some reason (e.g. https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/2728/commits/10517d421fc6ab2cb258251d55743994da075e48 for Lodestar).\n\nMy `SyncCommittee` implementation fails on the spec tests, specifically on calculating the hash tree root.  Given `SyncCommittee` is a simple list of 512 public keys followed by a public key I'm struggling to understand why.",
