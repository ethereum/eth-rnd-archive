However, it turns out that blockBody.HashTreeRoot() does not equal blockHeader.BodyRoot().  I have verified that both block header and block body are from the same slot (I tried several different slots)\n\nblockBody here is of type capella.BeaconBlockBody and blockHeader is of type phase0.BeaconBlockHeader.  Any ideas as to why this may be?",
