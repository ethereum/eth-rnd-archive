If one rewards retroactively one can also try to incentivize timeliness of proposer duties (i.e. propose 0s as opposed to close to 4s into slot). A heuristic could be to scale the proposer's reward by the share of same-slot committee votes that a block receives and are included in the subsequent block. Idea being that the earlier a block is proposed the more likely it is to receive many same-slot votes. Obvious caveat being that MEV incentives may dominate.",
