For the most part, I hope smart contract developers don't have to think through things as receipt-driven. Goal is to have a lot of the underlying machinery be abstracted via HLLs like solidity or DSLs like vyper, etc. IE for a smart contract developer you can think through these problems within the model of asynchronous programming.",

It happens to be that block proposal leverages the crosslink committee shuffling so that every proposer for a slot also attests to the same slot; however we can imagine modifications to the proposer shuffling that change this relation",
