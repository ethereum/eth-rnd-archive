        "content": "On the Holesky Pectra incident: Let's assume at epoch 10000 we had the block hash 0xaaaa in slot index 0. Then in slot index 2 we had the fork. The minority side and the majority side go separate ways, the LMD Ghost votes start to differ, yet the Casper FFG votes still agree in their target vote that 0xaaaa is the right checkpoint for epoch 10000. Given that everyone agrees on that, did that pre-fork checkpoint justify on both sides of the fork and became the basis for the new source vote in the post-fork next epoch?\n\nI believe that the answer to the above should be \"yes\", because the majority side attestations should still be valid votes on the minority side, at least wrt to Casper. But there two problems: 1. I am not sure whether a vote from the other fork side can be included at all because the LMD Ghost vote is incompatible. The spec seems to allow it, if I read it correctly. 2. The second problem is that I suspect that the minority chain would have trouble to include all target votes from the majority side during the epoch 10000, because \u003e66% of the blocks are missing on the minority side, so space to include attestations is missing. Can the minority side use the post-fork epoch to include those pre-fork majority attestations eventually or will the max_inclusion_delay cut it off as the data ages?\n\nDo we have empirical evidence as to what was the last justified epoch in Holesky incident that both forks agreed on? Was it the checkpoint right before the fork (so the epoch in which the fork occurred), or was it two checkpoints before?\n\n(I am trying to design a safer attestation data aggregator for a multi-client setup and my arguments depend a bit on what happens to the source vote on the minority side of the fork)",
