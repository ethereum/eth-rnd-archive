I don't think that having this be down to simple luck is a good thing at all.\n\n\u003c@!340345049063882753\u003e said that he didn't like the idea of validators being paid for doing nothing, but in my mind this is by far the lesser evil compared to a system with such high levels of variability on an individual validator's income.  And it gives us a reserve pool of \"ready and waiting\" validators to pull from when the next piece of functionality requires a validator.\n\nIf you think of the 8/64 reward for non-members of the sync committee as being \"was ready to sign but didn't\". for members of the sync committee as being \"was ready to sign and did\", and no reward for \"was not ready to sign when required\" it doesn't seem so bad.",
