For example, if a large exit queue is a concern then it would be great to lay out the details of how much it would cost a validator to exit and balance that against frequency of proposal to see under which conditions a rational validator is likely to exit.\n\nI'd still be concerned about the fact that this requires existing validators to create a new validator, which requires at least 1 Ether from the execution layer to start with, and so would possibly increase centralization.  On-chain cost (transmission and storage) of potentially lots of `delegate` operations would be another area.  Would be good to see these discussed.",
