At this point in the SSZ spec we need to serialize a sum of lengths:\n```\n# Interleave offsets of variable-size parts with fixed-size parts\nvariable_offsets = [serialize(sum(fixed_lengths + variable_lengths[:i])) for i in range(len(value))]\n```\nNow those numbers (the results of the sums) are to be considered as `uintN` where `N`  is the minimal number in `[8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]` such that the number fits or is it serialized as a uint with fixed `N` ?",
