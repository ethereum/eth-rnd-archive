Although there are only 10% of the blocks in which to put an attestation, there are only 10% of the attestations to fit in said blocks.  And if I remember correctly then as long as an attestation for a validator is included somewhere in the epoch it does not get hit with the inactivity leak, so its loss should be far less than the leaking validators.\n\nI think the biggest factor would be the lack of attestation aggregators on the network, and related the p2p links between them.  But if that is true then it's also a positive story, because for every % reduction of the majority client the network will recover more quickly and active validators will have less of a hit.  The 1/3 and 2/3 numbers are important, but so is every number inbetween.\n\nI'm sure there is a % of inactive validators where the network basically falls apart, but it's likely a dynamic number on various fronts and so attempting to reach a better distribution between clients is always going to be positive.",

Aggregation is particularly slow in Prysm, but in block processing, attestation processing is not that bad. The worst impact is in adding the latest votes to forkchoice, but I think even doubling block capacity this won' t change as eventually most attestations make it to FC anyway. I think doubling attestation capacity in blocks is a nobrainer if validator reward is something we care about. From the point of view of safety and resilience of the network I don' t see this as an urgent change, since we can always survive these events.",
