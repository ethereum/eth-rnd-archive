In this case, the beacon chain actually gets shorter, after the reorg, correct?\n\nBasically the chain goes from slots: `... 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81`\nTo the new chain: `... 74, 82, 83`\n\nThis seems to have interesting implications for the EL side.  If we assume that each of these slots were filled, and that slot 74 contained EL block 1000, then the chain reorgs like so:\n\nFrom: `1000 (74), 1001 (75), 1002 (76), 1003 (77), 1004 (78), 1005 (79), 1006 (80), 1007 (81)`\nTo `1000 (74), 1001 (82), 1002 (83)`\n\nWhich is to say that the canonical EL chain gets shorter.  Am I reading this correctly that this is possible?",
