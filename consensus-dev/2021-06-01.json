But its there if it's useful for anyone to test with.",

Participation was still 100% but justification and finalization was delayed by one epoch as the fork happened and then kicked back in.\nIt wouldn't surprise me if that was a bug in Teku's transition process as that's exactly the area where the reference tests aren't yet working so hasn't been verified.",
