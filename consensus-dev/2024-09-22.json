        "content": "In addition to that issue, something that came from Lucas's comment is that we are adding some actual latency to the proposer/builder's flow, this may be quite non-trivial. Currently we can precache most of the state root computation from the consensus part of the block, we can perform the state transition and modulo a couple of leaves we would get few differences between the local vs builder's state root computation (the payload hash enters in the execution header committed to the state). But in Electra, we *also* need to perform some extra state transition coming from requests. This will lead to larger bids and I suspect higher latency in block production. \n\nAs I typically say, this **is not** a problem in ePBS: in ePBS the requests are not even part of the bid, and the state root is commited by the builder, not the proposer, so there's no need for any input from the builder to compute the new state root except that extra leaf coming from the header's hash.",
