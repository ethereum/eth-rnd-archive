The current algorithm, even using unrealized justification, will only deem that slot safe 12 seconds later.  Those 12 seconds may mean a lot to some users. Who am I to restrict their usage of the network? Why should we decide for them what's safe or not?",

It is meant to be a signal that \"for the majority of people, this is a safe enough tag to use\".",
