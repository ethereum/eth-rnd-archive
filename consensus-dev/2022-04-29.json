I think calling`update_head` before proposing is the right thing to do. However if I read strictly the PR that will require us to ensure we process pending attestations as well. This is a little more invasive. We process pending attestations twice per slot, at the beginning and at 6 seconds. This means that in most cases when we request a block to propose we would have just processed the previous attestations. But it may be the case that we're still processing as this happens in a routine. Making the call to process attestations locking requires some change",
