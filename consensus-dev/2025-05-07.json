We have published the consensus specs v1.5.0 release: [official announcement here](https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/595701770034872362/1369642239722127421). Please note that this includes a change to the [minimal configuration for Electra](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4291), so some test failures in Electra and Fulu are expected. Also, for Fulu, this release updates the [`DataColumnsByRootIdentifier` request structure](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4284), so some test failures are expected there too.",
