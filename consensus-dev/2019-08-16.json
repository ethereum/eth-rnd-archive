In phase 0, there is no state execution so it is just the fork choice on the data chain. In phase 2, the expectation is to run the state transitions in the state-less EE model, this can be done simply via the data contained in the blocks (merkle state witnesses are embedded) and thus no full state sync has to occur.",
