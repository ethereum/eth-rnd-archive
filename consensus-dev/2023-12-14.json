I was about to open a spec PR to change it to be unrealized justification when it hit me that actually we shouldn't specify this for anything. In fact I believe that we shouldn't be testing that clients send the same value here at all. There is nothing in the spec that relies on this value afaik and this is definitely something that different consumers would have divergent safety thresholds. As such I would be inclined to open a PR explicitly stating what the engine API does: some guidelines as to what this value should be, some boundaries (like being canonical) but not forcing clients to set it to anything specific. I am posting here before cause this is probably less kosher than the PR just requesting it to be unrealized justification",
