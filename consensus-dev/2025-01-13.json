There are any number of items that could be named better (everything ending in `_QUOTIENT` for starters) but doing so doesn't always make things clearer, and tends to break stuff unexpectedly.\n\n(FYI Vouch doesn't look at this value, but it does take config information rather than hardcode values where possible so renaming other values would have an impact.)",
