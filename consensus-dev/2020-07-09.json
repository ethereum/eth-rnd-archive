We ran the test 10 times for each block and we always obtained the exact same compressed result for each block, but the compression time changes, so we take the average of the 10 runs. We got an average compression ratio of 1.850, the minimum compression ratio observed was 1.507 and the maximum 2.416. The average compression speed was 508.922 MB/s, and we observed some variation on these numbers, going from 380.042 MB/s for the lowest to 785.055 MB/s for the fastest. We also noticed that in general decoding is almost twice faster than encoding, with the compression taking about 282µs for a ~100KB block, but only 149µs for decoding.",
