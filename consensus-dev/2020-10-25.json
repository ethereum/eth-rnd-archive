With on average 1050000 ETH voting it is of course easy to calculate how much active ETH staked we would need so that this represents 2/3. But how fast do we get from 2046000 ETH to 1575000 ETH assuming participating ETH stays the same. Active validators leak ETH inactive validators leak more and at different points in time different numbers of validators will hit the 16 ETH threshold. Or is there an easier way to approximate it with reasonable accuracy?",

That makes the math easier, as it's a race to 16.75 Ether.\n\nA validator that has never been active started around 30 Ether, so expect the inactivity leak to take another 8 days or so to reduce its balance enough.  Validators that were active but now aren't may have ~31 Ether, so another day for the to go out.\n\nThat said, participation rate has increased over the past few days so we may limp up to 67%.  Personally I hope not, as a clean out of the inactive validators would be a good thing long-term.",
