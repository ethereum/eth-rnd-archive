I would like to know if someone has experience in implementing SSZ, we are thinking about implementing SSZ in Elixir because we are having to many corner case errors with the Rust to Elixir NIF. \n\nWhat do you think and what is the work weight of such an impl ?",

However going for a performant impl to achieve fast serde, hashing speeds with lower memory footprint while being completely generic does complicate things significantly. You should decide first how do you want to represent data and how to cache hashing, as that greatly influences the design",
