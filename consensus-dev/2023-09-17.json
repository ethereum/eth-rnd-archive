Rewards will typically not change them as most validators are active and already have a maximum effective balance. Leaking validators from time to time will drop their effective balance and thus change. BLS to execution address changes, exits, slashings, top up deposits (of validators with less than 32 ETH effective balance) etc will change the validator structure. These are not fixed per epoch",
