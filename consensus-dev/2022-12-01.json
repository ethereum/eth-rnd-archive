I think there will have to be a few iterations before this could reasonably work.\n- We just switched to PoS. Validators would be unhappy.\n- This hasn't been thought out very much.\n- The liveliness assumption (although this might be nice, as it might decrease mempool congestion if all transactions become invalid after 12s)\n- Higher chance of transactions getting reorged due to selecting non-optimal parent blocks\n- Possibly a lower cost to do a reorg, although that's debatable\n- How do we prevent Ethereum from becoming *too* deflationary?",
