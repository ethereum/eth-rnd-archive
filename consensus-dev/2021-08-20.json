        "content": "Basically it allows you to directly target your eventual withdrawal at an ethereum address as opposed to having to specify an address later. It's primarily designed for staking service providers who want to withdraw to a contract. The vast majority of private stakers have not been using this setting and so will have a slightly different withdrawal experience, from those that did. It's not better or worse, just different functionality for those who need it. Read more here: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2149",

The other way seems out of the question",

That might change of course. Now if a user wishes to stake with Blox, because of their desktop app wanting the seed phrase (😖 ), it can make a lot of sense to generate deposit files with 0x01 and deposit that way, then import the signing keys via seed phrase. It mitigates some risk. Agreed that's a bit niche and, really, the ideal situation is that the seed phrase isn't needed just to get signing keys",
