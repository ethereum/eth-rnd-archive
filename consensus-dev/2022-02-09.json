        "content": "well you see this quite often now: some blocks get few votes, this is typically the situation that the block arrived late to most validators, but some managed to see them on time. One typical scenario is a block proposed late by a pool running many keys. In this case the pool submits the block and the attestations for this block, but no one else gets the block in time and they send attestations for the previous head. Depending on when the next block proposer gets this block it may be orphaned or not",

Blocks that arrive at 5 seconds are a problem, no one can attest for them, but the next proposer (and the whole network) do see the valid block. So if the next proposer decides to censor the late block, he's taking a risk that his own block will be orphaned. Every single stock client in this situation will have the next proposer not censor the late block",
