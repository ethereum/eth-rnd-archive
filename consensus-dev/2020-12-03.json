It's pretty easy with BLS to aggregate 3 public keys, and similarly to aggregate the 2 signatures. However, I'm not aware of an in-built way to define the signature threshold - it seems that the threshold can only be enforced by the verifier (i.e. check that the aggregated signature is valid for at least 2 of the 3 aggregated pubkeys)\n\nWill ETH2 have a way to define a signature threshold for accounts? Am I missing something and this is actually non-issue?",
