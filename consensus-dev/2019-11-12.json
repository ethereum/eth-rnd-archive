Should it allow the return of deposited Ether, in case something catastrophic occurs (someone proves that a key piece of phase 2 is impossible, a major weakness is found in BLS12-381, etc.)?  If the deposit contract is never going to be altered it could be deployed in such a way that no-one knows the private key",
