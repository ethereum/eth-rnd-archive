Generally VDFs are used where you want to *ensure* there is a minimum delay between two events, but without wasting a massive amount of resources on hashing power and hashing rewards.  In order to guarantee a delay, you need a mechanism for getting information about what the fastest VDF solver someone has built is.  To do that, you need to basically bribe VDF solvers to show their speed.",
