I guess you grabbed each sync committee and ordered vertically only by validator index right? And then identified the indices that you know of. I suppose we've had enough sync committees already to gather enough info from nodes that either the EF or client teams are running? I remember on pyrmont it was an issue that sync committee participation was lower than attestation participation, in pointing to bugs in the implementation. Was this solved completely?",

        "content": "Hi sorry for the general tagging, but I want to understand an issue with attestation handling that apparently is hurting the validators that are actually optimized. I would like to know how clients other than prysm handle the following situation: \n1) You receive an attestation for the block `N` in the current slot `N`, 1 second into the slot. \n2) You do not have the block `N`. Question 1) do you put the attestation into a queue for later processing?\n3) If the answer to Question 1) is yes. Suppose that you receive the block `N` 3 seconds into the slot, and you process it in 0.1 seconds. So by 3.1 seconds into the slot you have both the block and the attestation for it in a Queue. When is this queue processed? \nMy understanding is that prysm will only process this attestation once per slot! this I think it's a bug that is hurting validators, but I would want to know how other clients are handling this as it seems to be expensive to call the processing of attestations regularly. Options can be to process these queues right after updating the head (in addition to the beginning of the slot that needs to be done anyway).  Another option is to at least call this clearing a couple of times per slot so that there's a chance that these attestations will be seen for aggregators in this slot.",
