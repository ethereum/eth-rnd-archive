        "content": "1. I would discern \"validator has seen the data D\" and \"validator owns the data D\", in my mental model these are proof of publication and proof of retention (storage) respectively. IMO, current version of custody game is well designed for proof of publication (the former part) but isn't suitable for the latter. Honest minority or majority assumption is one of the solutions for data retention and retrievability\n2. If a large staker must provide proof of storage and/or proof of retrievability it will have to replicate data on its own infrastructure to avoid data loss and follow up penalties, a number of replication in this case will likely be lower than a number of validators but as long as data is retrievable it should be fine, IMHO",
