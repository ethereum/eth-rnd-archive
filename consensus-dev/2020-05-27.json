I am looking at developing an easy hosted eth2.0 validator hosting and I am trying to figure out if there is an easy way to implement commission payments for the node operator in a trust-less way. The idea is that the node operator charges a commission on the rewards the validator node did. Do you think that will be possible? I reviewed the current testnet deposit contract and it is super simple and does not support even a simple withdrawals. is there some place where such mechanics are discussed?",
