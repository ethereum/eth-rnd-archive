Would testing a network before it finalizes for the first time be a good way to test the properties of LMD-GHOST, or are the pre-first-finalization considerations too burdensome for testing before the first epoch is finalized?\n\nThe other option I've been exploring for testing LMD-GHOST is to take a devnet that's finalized several epochs, then knock 34% of its validating stake offline to prevent finalization. That way, I can test against the remaining 65% to explore LMD-GHOST's runtime properties.",

Those are the kinds of bugs that would exponentiate if you manage to put offline many nodes at once",

There's been some faults where if we run the fault before the first epoch is finalized, the impacted nodes stop attesting and need to be restarted to continue. I haven't spent much time isolating what's causing these issues because I wasn't sure if there was value in finding these kind of halts before the first epoch is finalized. \n\nIf the pre-first-epoch code and checkpoint sync code act very similar, then it's almost definitely worth the time to isolate the issues.",
