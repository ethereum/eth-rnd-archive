Would 5% return over 6 months be something that would sway them? 10%?\n\nThe problem of going down the path of using financial levers to try to change behaviour is it rapidly becomes full of loopholes that encourage behaviour you didn't want and constrains future changes.  I think the idea of the returns curve is sound, it just needs some work done to ensure that the highs aren't too high and the lows aren't too low.  And if there is a single (theoretical) lever that moves the entire curve up and down if required that should be enough to fix things if they head out of whack.\n\n(That said, I *do* think that the current validator system is not exactly encouraging to potential stakers; if I had to pick a single word to describe it I'd go for \"violent\".  Definitely a discussion to be had, but for a bit later on.)",
