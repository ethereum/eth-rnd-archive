The major gains in a phase 1.5 will be in access to a highly scalable data layer\nThe obvious application that benefits from this (and scales) are rollup chains. Beyond that, I do expect there to be much innovation in the application layer leveraging layer 1 data\n\nso the answer is \"not much increase, unless you are running the numbers on rollups. if rollups, then massive increase over what tehy can do on mainnet today\"",
