So being up \u003e50% of the time means you don't lose stake in the long run (roughly).\n\n(2) If many people are offline (\u003e1/3 of validators) and the chain stops finalising, you get an extra penalty for being offline, which gets big over time.\n\n(3) If only you are slashed then you lose 1 Eth and get kicked out. If many people are slashed around the same time, the punishment is bigger, up to the full 32 Eth.\n\nhth.",
