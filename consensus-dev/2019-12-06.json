        "content": "If I had to give an argument, I'd say one of the reasons is that VRF is secure *after* selection, i.e. needs checking. Randao and Randao + VDF are secure ahead of time. You know the number will be random without checking. In Eth where there will potentially be hundreds of thousands of people validating, it would be incredibly difficult to check all the VRF rolls, but with VDF there's only one thing to check against the incoming blocks. So VRF, you get blocks, then check them along with the proof submitted by the validator. With VDF, blocks get checked against the random roll that's common for everyone. Additional proof per block not needed.",

Please read https://hackmd.io/bCZjQnOyRBqxyHKxKnTz0Q?view\n\nAlso, I've put together a PR with a test that fails with the current contract but succeeds with the amended contract (also in the PR): https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1506\n\nHopefully either the text or the test (or both in conjunction) should be enough to highlight the issue and explain its fix.",
