        "content": "One more thing is that if you make the variable name generic, it's easier to add things to the variable without having to come up with new, longer names. For example, if we want to include a EL operation `Xyz` in the F-fork, we can keep the name `ExecutionLayerRequest` , possibly adding a `V2` suffix. If we name it `ExecutionLayerExitAndWithdrawal` now, then it will have to be `ExecutionLayerExitAndWithdrawalAndXyz`... You see the point.\n\nGeneralization is a double edged-sword  though, because you can put basically anything under a very generally-named object and make it monstrous, and contain many unrelated responsibilities.",
