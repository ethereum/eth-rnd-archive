        "content": "Hey there, a question to the very valuable overview (https://ethpandaops.io/posts/fusaka-bandwidth-estimation/) for the updated hardware requirements post-fusaka. All the upload bandwidth requirement numbers are only referencing the blob data, right?\nBecause this caveat Theoretical values proposed earlier in the document do not capture the nuances of running a node such as mempool traffic on the EL, providing sync state to peers and other background gossip makes it clear that bandwidth which is consumed by a fullnode in general is not included in these numbers, right?\n\nIf my interpretation is correct I have one more question: Can I reduce upload bandwidth usage while not propagating my IP to the network? My interpretation is that no peer can connect to my node in this case, hence the upload bandwidth used will be lower.\n\nI'm not a fan of doing that but it might be the only viable solution unfortunately 🙁 .",
