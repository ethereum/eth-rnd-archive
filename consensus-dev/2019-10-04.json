But very poor for repeated downloads on clean non-cached machines (some CI here...). However, for consumption purposes they only change per release, so we add gzipped tarballs to the release to allow for non-LFS efficient and unbilled downloads. That should cover the CI re-download use-case much better. But agree we might have to stop putting tests on LFS if high-bandwidth consumption is higher priority than git-like versioning.",
