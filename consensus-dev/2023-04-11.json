I am in favour of removing the merge transition code as well. IIUC, one of the arguments against doing so is that there are chains that running beacon chain and PoW and might want to do transition from PoW to PoS at some point, and also these chains should be able to roll out any beacon chain upgrades. I believe if we start to work on this cleanup with enough time before the upcoming fork these arguments can be sorted out",
