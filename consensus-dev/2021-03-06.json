This has seen a marked improvement in the last few weeks, most likely due to the roll-out of updated clients with improvements to block creation and propagation time.  Hard to tell what the final impact of the changes are, as there are no doubt some clients that have yet to be updated, but it's way better than it was, even in the face of on-going additional validators.",
