There’s a lot of factors to how many blobs per tx you’d want to send - more blobs amortises the execution cost more but means it takes longer to fill up that data and thus the chain safe head updates less often. And if you’re submitting a block with the full limit of blobs it can’t fit alongside any other blob tx which can delay inclusion (less so now but was a challenge prior to pectra). I believe there may be some block builders that don’t include blob tx as well which makes it appear as if more capacity is available than there actually is (also really only noticeable pre pectra). \nFinally because the blob base fee is so low it actually makes it very slow to increase so even when there is temporary congestion for blobs the price doesn’t increase fast.",
