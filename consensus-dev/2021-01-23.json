I read  in Danny's write-up that the idea to run the beacon chain by itself, before merging eth1 into it, was to ensure its robustness. But since it is really not doing anything with eth wallets or contracts, there is no incentive for bad actors to try to find holes in the protocol or implement attacks. So really it seems to me that the beacon chain is just a glorified testnet, and only when eth1 will be merged into it will it be really tested. Am I missing something?",
