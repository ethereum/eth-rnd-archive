        "content": "Eth2.0 specs: formal verification using Dafny: The PegaSys Consensus Protocols and Formal Verification team will be giving a talk at the Ethereum Engineering Group meet-up on Wednesday May 13 at 12:30pm, Brisbane, Australia time zone (GMT+10). Register on meetup.com for this event: https://www.meetup.com/ethereum-engineering/events/269880527/\nFor those of you who can't be on the call due to timezones, the slides and video will be posted on our youtube channel shortly after the talk. The abstract for the talk is: \nThe Eth2.0 specifications are the specifications for next generation of Eth2 clients.\nEnsuring that the specifications are bug-free, consistent, and unambiguous is instrumental in creating a trustworthy Ethereum ecosystem.\nIn this talk, we present our work on the formal verification of the Eth2.0 specifications phase 0. We use the verification-aware programming language Dafny to write specifications, implementations, and the proofs that the implementations satisfy the specifications.\nWe will introduce the basics of the Dafny formal verification framework and illustrate how it can be applied to specify, debug, fix and prove the correctness of core functionalities of the Eth2.0 specifications.",
