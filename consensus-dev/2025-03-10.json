Is it possible that two attestations `a1` and `a2` have exactly the same attestation data, are for the same slot and for the same committee index, but have different aggregation bit lengths (meaning that the committees have different lengths)? We observed this in Prysm during the Holesky incident and I don't know if we have a bug in Prysm or not. Can this line ever produce a different state for `a1` and `a2`? `data` is the attestation data of course.\n```\npreState, err := s.cfg.chain.AttestationTargetState(ctx, data.Target)\n```",
