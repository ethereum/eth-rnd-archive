        "content": "Heya. Up through Bellatrix, it was possible to recover from `engine_getPayload` failure by producing an empty payload as a fallback. With Capella, this is not possible anymore, so a widespread block production issue on popular EL could also force non-finality.\nhttps://github.com/etan-status/consensus-specs/commit/vd-emptyblock\nSo far, feedback has been mostly to ignore this failure mode. To still keep a record of this, created this commit with a minimal spec change to continue supporting those empty payload fallbacks. If there is interest to take this further, can make a PR out of it.",
