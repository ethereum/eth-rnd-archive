        "content": "Hello, I've been lately thinking on ways to harden our circuit breaker, and getting worried more and more about centralization on the builders. Our circuit breaker is designed to prevent attacks on liveness in the case the relayers fail or the builders are down or a bug of the form. But we do very little to deal with censorship for example. Some efforts have started with relay monitors and falling back to local execution if the local payload is worth more than the builder's. I think these are valuable efforts and we should try to find a list of triggers that is more exhaustive and should be cheap to check. Examples I have in mind are to fallback to local execution if:\n- We see a transaction paying a lot of priority fee that it's not being included for some slots. \n- We see a transaction that is being effectively censored by forking:  every last few blocks that tried to include it were reorged. \n- We see a transaction that is being eclipsed by the builder: We have had a few blocks trying to include it and their execution payloads were invalid. \n\nThanks \u003c@360491619402776577\u003e for putting up a PR in geth that would deal with the second scenario. I  was hoping that we can get to some feedback and try to get these idea some traction. \u003c@291925846556540928\u003e You may have an opinion here. I think these already warrant enough to try to separate the blobs from the execution payload as well as discussed in \u003c#595701195843174434\u003e .",

        "content": "One of the ideas that seem to be getting a lot of traction is that of optimistic relay. On this idea the relayer would not verify the payload and the builder will be staked so that it would have to pay if it doesn't reveal the block or if its block is invalid. This invalidates any censorship oracle based on statistical analysis of forking censorship , even in the presence of inclusion lists: \n- validator submits its inclusion list\n- builder submits a bid saying that it will include the transactions, \n- relayer checks the payload has the transactions but doesn´t validate it\n- validator signs header\n- payload is invalid, builder pays validator.\nThis way the builders get arbitrary block eclipsing for linear cost on their stake. A way to prevent this is if you see invalid blocks containing the same transaction, then don't use the relay.",
