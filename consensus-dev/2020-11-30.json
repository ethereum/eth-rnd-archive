In just a few weeks I now understand why people find this design beautiful and challenging it's been addictive.  The more you read the more you forget about your own job",

Although I believe we're rushing into this without having had a flawless public testnet launch, my interactions mostly with people from prysm but also from guys from Lighthouse, Tekku, Nimbus and Attestant has been an incredible experience. I don't think I've seen this level of dedication 24/7 to support their users in other projects. I hope you get some vacations between genesis and v1.1",
