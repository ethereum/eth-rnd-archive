I think we've already hit the desired stake (5M ETH), and should now reduce staking rewards so that only technically skilled and politically motivated users remain. There is a clear \"political premium\" where people will solo stake (not delegate to pool) even at low yield, but that userbase gets diluted when you have say 50M ETH staked.",

This may be very frequent, to quickly serve arbitrary historical data without processing, including validator balances (which change at least 200 times per day, for all validators). I am not sure what the `--archive` flag configures, but I expect it to to be 32 or 64. The default is 2048, and technically you don't need the snapshots at all for already-finalized chain history, as long as you have the blocks to serve others.",
