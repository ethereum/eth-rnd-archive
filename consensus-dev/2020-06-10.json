Just wondering other's thoughts around coordination.",

This heavy skew to one client will likely mask many multi-client issues like consensus errors, fork choice discrepancies, etc (while still likely being valuable for prysm testing)\n\nI know Prysmatic has a large following and will likely have a large Onyx  network, but I hope that over the next month or so that community participation begins to favor the native multi-client nets (if we assume that hobbyists/users just want to run one testnet at a time). I won't predict the exact fate and/or numbers of these coming nets, but as a native and large-scale multi-client testnet becomes available, I will certainly encourage more of the community to run a diverse set of nodes there",
