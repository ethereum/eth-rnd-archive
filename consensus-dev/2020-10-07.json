I guess more experimentation would be needed when the file is being put via multiple nodes, as maybe it's cheating via some optimisation when 2 nodes first talk to each other, though I've confirmed node A and B aren't maintaining a direct connection with each other. IPFS also supports private DHTs, so in theory you can construct a DHT where the only keys allowed are ones that correspond to blocks that have consensus, thus significantly reducing the size of the DHT.\nAlso, the IPFS daemon maintains about ~1000 TCP connections FWIW...",
