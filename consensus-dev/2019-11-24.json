Pubkey in the message would work only for unaggregated attestation and even in that case peer would need to double check with a set of pubkeys of active validators that this key exists. It would be more straightforward to keep committees for a couple of epochs in memory. Size of this kind of cache is only a few megabytes for a million of validators. I guess in the normal case we need to keep previous and current epoch cached. Might be more in case of instability, but should not be that much anyway.",
