I’ve spoken about it in this channel, I link to it afterwards.\n\nBasically block propagation is (unnecessarily IMO) slow at the moment which is causing blocks to arrive after attestations are sent out. \n\nAn oversight in the Eth2 spec means that these late blocks don’t get attested to but they still end up in the chain, causing a missed head vote.",
