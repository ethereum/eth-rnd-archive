This is the new target for epbs-devnet-0. Most notably, builders are now separate from validators and therefore do not perform validator duties ([#4788](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4788)). Additionally, this release refactors the withdrawal functions, introduces a new gossip topic for proposer preferences, updates the fork-choice logic for Gloas, and many other improvements. Please note that this release does not contain comprehensive reference tests for builders; this will come in future releases.",
