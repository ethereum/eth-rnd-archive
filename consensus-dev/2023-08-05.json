But if we move to ssz on transactions then we will need large uints in different places. I'm open to using whatever library is used in the Ethereum ecosystem for large uints. The only thing that I'd like is that at least on little endian systems the memory representation of these types is exactly their serialization. I think ssz+ is probably broken anyway for uint256 on big endian systems (don't have a machine to test)",

But I'm not sure where are you going to use it. I expect for sole ssz impl any 32-byte container type should work.\n\nAnyway, ping me if you need contributions in this area.",

A cursory look and it seems that all your ints are stored as contiguous arrays of 64 uints so that would work for sure on little endian systems for me and most probably would work on 64 bit big endian as well",
