        "content": "Hello everyone! I'm trying to count attestations to measure participation rates etc, but for some reason I seem to overcount. What I do is quite simple: Count the number of bits set in the aggregation bitfields, fetched from a prysm node with `/eth/v1/beacon/blocks/{slot}/attestations`. If there's multiple attestations for one `(slot, committee index)` pair, I make sure not to double count validators (so if there's bitfields `[1, 0, 0]` and `[1, 0, 1]` I count this as two validators participating).\n\nBut I'm still overcounting: With this method, for epoch 147000 I count 454232 individual attestations. But there's only ~430000 active validators (and each of those should only attest exactly once per epoch if I'm not mistaken). Any ideas what I could be doing wrong?",
