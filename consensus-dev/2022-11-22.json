The CL has planned for a while to include withdraws in Capella, but it wasn't until very recently that there was actual discussion about Shanghai with the EL devs.  In theory, withdraws could be implemented in Capella without users actually being able to withdraw anything (I'm personally a fan of this as it means we successfully separated EL/CL forks).",
