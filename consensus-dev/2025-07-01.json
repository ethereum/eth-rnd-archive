And from my understanding that the attestation process is time dependant and not any event dependant. It will automatically attest to the latest local view of its state.  So I am assuming it still participates in the attestation process. \n\nAm I assuming right ? Or it depends on the implementation of the CL client ?",

They can still be downloading historic data, that's fine and won't block attesting.\n\nHowever, if either CL or EL is still syncing forwards, then no attestations will be produced. The validator hasn't fully validated the state, so it is unsafe for them to attest to it.",
