(in my eyes).. that said, curious what the community's view is on the above.. thx..",

        "content": "unrelated to the above.. RE 1559 implemetation post-merge, to my understanding, each validator will then be responsible for setting his / her own gas limit for each block that is proposed.  Today, the miners (decently organized)  should put the limit at 30MM for the London hardfork.. to my understanding this is a manual setting overriding the default gas limit.. from my lens, that is fine. as there are fewer participants. however when viewed post-merge and we have a large group of folks that may or may not update the gas limit.. there may be wisdom in updating the default gas limit for the execution cleints to 30MM before the merge.. the concern is that the gas limit will be all over the place.",
