I think it was last mentioned here (https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3466#issuecomment-1674570042) and scheduled to be bundled with Deneb release, but  I've just noticed the issue description now says Electra - it might be outdated though (cc \u003c@425572898787426305\u003e) \nhttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3466\nHave other client teams included this in the Goerli release?",
