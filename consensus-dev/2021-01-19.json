Can the same algorithm be used for ETH2 or is the situation sufficiently different?  How does this change with sharding?",

We're seeing a lot of blocks in the first slot of the epoch be orphaned because their processing time is higher (there's a spec change coming to fix that, plus client optimisations done \u0026 in progress).  When you add in transaction execution, more full blocks will similarly take more time to create and more time to propagate around the network, increasing the risk of being orphaned.\nI'm not even sure the risk is lower, in PoW on average you have 14 seconds or so before the next one is found, in Eth2 you only have 4 seconds until attestations are generated.",
