EIP editors agreed that if CL folks want to join as Core EIP editors (which are the EIPs that affect consensus rules), we could give them \"force merge\" permission so that they can override the bot and not have to deal with the various technical checks in the process. \n\nThis will hopefully reduce the friction for CL folks to start using EIPs to better contextualize proposed changes, while also being a good way for these new editors to start better understanding the process. \n\nI can give a bit more details on the CL call tomorrow, but if anyone is tentatively interested in being a CL Core EIP editor, please 📜-react to this and I'll follow up with you 😄 !",
