Details are here: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3689#issuecomment-2112987260\n\nI am looking at speccing out those things that we were discussing during the workshop right now. There is a big-deposit-test with 1000 deposits, https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3689#issuecomment-2117480097. It would be great if more clients run it to understand how bad is verifying 1000 sigs during block processing.",
