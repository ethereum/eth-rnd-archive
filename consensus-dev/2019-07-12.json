The weak subjectivity period is defined by the size of the v-set due to the queueing mechanism. I believe at 300k validators, it is ~8 months. This becomes both a tough storage and search problem. We have been discussing efficient strategies and will share notes soon. One component here is that policing will likely default \"sharded\" across nodes so that each policing node by default is only looking at a subset of the past attestations. That said, would expect some nodes (block explorers, data providers, etc) to default police the entire weak subjectivity history",
