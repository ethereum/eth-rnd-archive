For instance if eth issued is 30%-50% less after 1559 it'll give an indication as to what things are going to be like once miner issuance is gone post 2.0. Obviously many miners who sell their eth immediately are providing a lot of the eth for sale/liquidity on exchanges so what will happen once that drives up is going to be very interesting. Some of that must already be baked into the price of eth.",

        "content": "Dear eth2 team and community. I am running a node on a consumer grade notebook/hardware behind a usual ISP contract. Last night my router went down for a few hours until I restarted it.\n\nFirst, I understand why the network needs penalties. With a linear penalty it is kind of ok If that happens IMO. Even a few days would be ok, e.g. if the ISP got problems, If the notebook burns etc. A node just has to be online about 50%+ of the time to not loose ETH.\n\nI read about changing the penalty function from linear to quadratic. I guess that changes the situation. How fast will the penalty rise? Will a home run node owner have a problem if they sleep too long, or even need a few days to spin up a new node because they have hardware /ISP issues?\n\nI believe the quadratic function is to be introduced because the home grade nodes should not be punished as strong if they have usual home grade problems such as an unreliable connection.",

Otherwise, the normal linear penalty remains if you are offline, and no change is planned to that. There is a change to the quadratic inactivity penalty in the Altair upgrade, which is to apply the quadratic penalty based on individual validators' uptime records rather than the crude distance since finality. The rationale is here: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2125. It's basicaly no more punitive than the current scheme, and better for validators that are able to stay online.\n\nIn short:\n  - Chain finalising, no change to offline penalties is planned.\n  - Chain not finalising, penalties will be no worse than the current scheme, and smaller for those who continue validating.",
