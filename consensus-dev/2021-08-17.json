        "content": "Hey guys. I'm doing a talk, and youtube video, on eth2 and the merge, but not fully understanding how the sharded data availability layer is going to work. Here is my understanding so far:\n\nThe Beacon Chain is where *all* consensus will take place post merge. This is the coordinator of all things. 64 shards will be created \"underneath\" the beacon chain, ie. the beacon chain will be master of these shards. \"eth1\" ie. the existing ethereum state (all accounts, contracts, contract state, etc.), will migrate to shard 0. These shards are \"data shards\", which means each block is basically a data blob with a header... Except shard 0 is a bit different in that eth1 is \"running\" there, so each block will contain regular tx data, similar to eth1 blocks that exist now. eth1 is not *really* \"running\" on shard 0, rather that is just where the data / state lives. The beacon chain is actually where the EVM lives, because the beacon chain has to actually compute state transitions and come to consensus on them. The *other* shard chains will start out empty, right? And the idea here is that these shard chains can be used as a place to publish roll-up data into these shard blocks... \n\nBut, how does new data get put onto these shards? Does a given roll-up like Arbitrum or w/e, *choose* a shard to write their data to? Do contracts get deployed to these shards? Do externally controlled accounts live on these shards? Can an account on one shard send to account on another shard? I understand we are not talking about sharded execution here, so it's not like each shard is running its own EVM so to speak. the Ethereum system will still be *one* system... So, are these shards essentially abstracted away? — simply serving as a way to provide higher data throughput?",
