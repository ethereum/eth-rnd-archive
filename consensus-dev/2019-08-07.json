I think this is one of the challenges to prove the liveness of ETH2.0 since we need a network model which capture the unpredictability of gossipping network, which is stronger than the traditional one where only the upper bound of message delay is assumed. Also, we should analyze how much extent adversary can predict splitting by observing and experimenting with the network.",

Unions default to the first type in the union (with type index zero), which is null if present in the union.`\n\nAnd while it might be kind of implicit that a default vector of SSZ types is just N number of the default values for the containing type, it does seem suspiciously absent from the above default values definition, which mentions the SSZ primitives, as well as Bitvector, Bitlist, Lists, and Unions. Poor vector just feels left out.",
