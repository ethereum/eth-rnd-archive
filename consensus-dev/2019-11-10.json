The index and amount values generated by the deposit contract are in little endian order so we need to flip them to big endian before using them in Java. The other values (pubkey, withdrawal_credentials and signature) should not be reversed from what our hash \u0026 bls implementations generate.  The deposit contract only ever treats them as arbitrary byte arrays so endianness is irrelevant.\n\nKey lesson learnt: things make a lot more sense when you're fresh Monday morning than they do late Friday afternoon.",
