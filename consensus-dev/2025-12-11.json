It seems this function will assign a non-zero weight to slot 0 (because `0 + 1 != 2`), a zero weight to slot 1 (because `1 + 1 == 2`), and a non-zero weight to slot 2\n\nwhat is this trying to do? I'm lost.",

        "content": "^answering my own question: this is because there are two fork choice nodes for each slot, so it was inaccurate of me to say that the slot 1 block has weight 0\n\nthe _pending_ (beacon block) fork choice node at slot 1 has non-zero weight, while the empty/full fork choice nodes for slot 1 have weight 0, and then use the tie-break score (based on payload timeliness) to choose between them",

        "content": "Hi, I’m trying to understand the staking validator and deposit lifecycle, specifically regarding EIP-6110.\nWhen I deposit to the contract to activate a new validator, as soon as my EL transaction is included in a block, will I see the deposit on the Beacon Chain immediately through this RPC?\n/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/pending_deposits\n(state ID passed as slot of the block where this got included on EL)\n\nIs this the expected behavior after the Electra upgrade? Or can there still be delays between EL txn inclusion and the CL pending deposits method returning it?\nAlso, how do the following limits affect when this EL-to-CL \"noticing\" happens?\n• PENDING_DEPOSITS_LIMIT\n• MAX_DEPOSIT_REQUESTS_PER_PAYLOAD\n• MAX_PENDING_DEPOSITS_PER_EPOCH\nIf I understand correctly, once it’s noticed by the CL, there is a queue after which the validator status goes to pending_initialized. Is this epoch deterministic? (I see beaconcha.in shows an estimated epoch, but I'm not sure how they arrive at it).\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if there’s a better place/channel to ask this question?",
