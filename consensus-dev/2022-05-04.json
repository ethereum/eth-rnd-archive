There are few missed blocks and about the same percentage of late blocks, so I'd say that clients are handling the load well. There's some effort to try to catch up with Prater, but if deposits keep coming on mainnet that will never happen.",

Just curious with proven replication factor, whether we are able to mitigate the issue assuming honest minority assumption as  \u003c@425572898787426305\u003e  mentioned (actually, even \u003c 1/3 honest should work as as long as there is at one honest).  One idea come up to my mind to prove replications is to use a modified Ethash - instead of running on ~4GB dag, it runs on whole D (assuming D can be ~ TB).  And the validator just needs to periodically upload a short hashrate (i.e., IO rate) oracle to a contract to verify.  This is similar to PoC, but ensuring that the actual data is stored per-validator.  E.g., assuming target storage device is an 500K 4K-IOPS random read NVME storage, then hashrate = 10M H/s implies that 10M / 500K = 20 devices are maintaining the D.",
