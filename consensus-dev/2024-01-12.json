In the desrcription of the issue I opened today https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/3577 I do not change EL behavior in any way, that is, this unlocking would not affect the EL in any form, and it would continue syncing in the same way. But given your comments on Twitter I suspect that you have some  justification for this from an EL perspective. Is that the case?",
