What blockers do we have in this area? As a side project I started an ETH 2 client implementation written in Elixir. So far I have added a libp2p implementation based on Erlang. Started to hook up some bindings to a standalone WASM precompile of Herumi BLS, which works and started working on a SSZ library in Elixir. I though that maybe focusing on the Validator first would be an interesting start as it is a lot simpler.",
