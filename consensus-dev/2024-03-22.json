Could I not calculate the same for any arbitrary validator?\n\nis it because a validator keeps track of its own EB in real-time, but the EB of other validators is settled after the epoch?\n\n\u003e However, the mix in that determines the randomness is fixed two epochs in advance and in mainnet the balance changes are never drastic enough to get it wrong if you just compute proposers for the next epoch.
