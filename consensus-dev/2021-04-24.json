There’s no chance any other client would have a bug with the same cause. On the other hand it’s a given that clients will have bugs and eventually they will wind up being important bugs despite all our best efforts. I’m not sure what discussion here could help either of those things. \n\nIt’s important to note that each client team provided a stream of updates, mostly in their own discord to keep users informed so it’s not like there was a lack of information. I think there’s some potential benefit in bringing conversations more into public. But the flip side is when you’re trying to react to an incident it’s important to have a focussed group of just the people you need rather than having a heap of voices or needing to worry about public perception and reactions.",
