        "content": "Hi guys, there is one question I had for a while that no one could answer on Stack Exchange and then someone proposed I ask it here: For every slot there is a goal to have `64 committees` of `target size 128`. The GitHub spec also says that the goal is to eventually have one high quality attestation per committee. The problem arises when we know that there will be multiple attestation aggregators per committee (like 16 or so). Thus, every committee will eventually have not one, but e.g. 16 aggregated attestations. In some notes (I believe Vitalik's) it is briefly mentioned that those aggregated attestations are hopefully again aggregated together and the trick is to figure a way which aggregations can further aggregated (and those are the ones that to not have any overlapping attestations). Please tell me if I am correct till here?\n\nIf I am then the question goes: who will carry those additional aggregations that (hopefully) lead to only one high quality aggregated attestation? Is it gonna be block proposer? My reasoning for block proposer comes from the fact that apparently chosen aggregating validators for certain committee as soon as they create aggregation, they broadcast it to the main global topic subnet",
