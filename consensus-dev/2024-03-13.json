That is, ~13 minutes with in-protocol deposit processing compared to ~12 hours with the existing mechanism.\n\nDoes this mean that the eth_follow_distance will be 0 instead of 2048? But voting validators in still takes place? If so, is there a limit how many validators can be voted in or will all validators receive an index immediately?",
