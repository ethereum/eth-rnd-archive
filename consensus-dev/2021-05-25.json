Given that there are well over 100,000 active validators, any given validator will be in a sync committee less than 0.5% of the time.\n\nIf an active validator is not in a sync committee it appears to be capped at 87.5% of full rewards, as the 8/64 contribution from contributing to the sync committee is not present.\n\nSo that appears to cap validator rewards in Altair to just over 7/8 of what they are today.  Or am I missing some weighting for validators not in the sync committee (or indeed overall) that balances this out?",

So if you're not performing a duty there's no reason you should be paid for it.  And if there's a reduction in rewards but enough validators stick around then that's fine.  If we don't have enough validators then we should increase the max issuance to incentivise more to join.\n\nOf course, in this period before withdrawals any reduction in rewards is pretty unfair and we should think carefully.  \n\nWe want to avoid being capricious but I do kind of like getting people used to the idea that we're actually trying to minimise their staking rewards (without too many of them leaving), not maximise them.",

I admittedly do not know the dangers of lowering the weight of proposals, but it is one of those places where someone has to put a finger and say \"this is the ratio, we're going with 1/8 of earnings\". The thing is that those 1/8 of earnings are being received now less frequently than monthly. And it will be less soon. The situation with the sync committee is also quite a lottery: you have 0,34% of chances of being in a committee every 2 days. So that's an expected median of over 4 months to being in one. If you run Kraken this doesn't matter. If you are a single staker this makes a difference. I get that there may be security reasons for these numbers, so I'll wait for the annotated spec to see if they are there. But it looks a bit extreme.",
