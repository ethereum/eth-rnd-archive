        "content": "The main issue w/ most of the existing multiplexers like this is that they only work w/ a single CL, which makes that CL a huge single point of failure for a large number of ELs.  I'd much prefer to run w/ a handful of CLs (say 2-3) powering a larger fleet of ELs.  The additional CLs could be \"standbys\" they don't need to be actively contributing.  I suspect we'll have to end up building our own since it's probably not a common configuration, and we'd need to do extensive testing of the failover scenarios.",
