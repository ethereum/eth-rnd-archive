Again, only _one_ altruistic slasher is needed. Compare that to the low incentives of running an ethx client when staking, and perverse incentives with MEV/VEV that have a centralizing effect.",

My interest comes from a vague intuition that the consensus layer will slowly start growing in messages it should handle. And depending on this it may be beneficial to plan ahead 1) a merge of the p2p stacks of both consensus and execution layers and 2) some gas-like mechanism for the consensus messages.",
