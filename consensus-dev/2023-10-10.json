        "content": "+ afaik clock drift is not much of a problem because each client will eventually sync with the network\n-- time is relative within networks anyway, so when a client joins a network, it's comparing its time with other client's time within the network and then adjusting as required, this is how it syncs with the network as i understand. \nif a client doesnt meet a 12s slot, it will meet the next one",
