Will update though with newer data in a couple of days. I'm no blogger so don't expect fancy writing, but I'm sure smart people here can take something out of this. There is a systematic error here which is that I am assuming that my node is in the canonical chainhead. This is perfect in mainnet, and has been on target on pyrmont as far as I have been checking. But I am not constantly checking this assumption during data gathering. Mostly cause I don't have time to change the script. \n\u003c@!124259917560414210\u003e \u003c@!539495253418180618\u003e This is related to what you are discussing",
