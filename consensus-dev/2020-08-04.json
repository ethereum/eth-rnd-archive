What are the tax implications? If I transfer ETH 1 to get ETH 2 to stake, is it going to be a tax event by US IRS standards? Will I then owe potentially many thousands or perhaps even millions of dollars in taxes? I think there is a lot of risk here which using technical means can be mitigated. The loss of liquidity is just the opportunity cost problem but that can be solved the easiest. What about tax efficiency and protecting stakers against big losses? Miners for example would not mine if they all know they could lose all their investment if the price collapses but with mining you can mine some other token.",
