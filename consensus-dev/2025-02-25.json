The CL reorgs the EL as required. The API calls takes an expiry time for this activity. This way a node operator can say “Temporarily follow me this leader node”.\n\nThat way, I don't need to do custom peerings, and bootnode magics. This should even scale well. I could loosly follow a node that is loosly following another node. All we need do to mitigate is 1. agree on a leader enr, have 100 nodes follow that, and then have 100 * 100 nodes following the first set of nodes. Having that exposed to a curl-able API makes it easy for unskilled node operators to execute. The effect isn't permanent and is lost when the node restarts.\n\nEDIT: Maybe instead of \"query this enr every 5 minutes\" it should be \"query this enr before finalizing a new epoch\", which is roughly equivalent. that logic would work better when syncing. the downside is that in my mitigation proposal, the leader nodes are almost ddos-ed, as all the queries of downstream nodes happen exactly at the same time.",
