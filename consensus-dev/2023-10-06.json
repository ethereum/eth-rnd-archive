Likely these will be decentralized, with individual rollups using their own decentralized sequencers, probably many of which would use PoS for permissionless validation\nLet’s say each has 100 validators\nThis means you need N*100 validators to secure the ecosystem, because none of the stake is shared across the ecosystem - every rollup has its own staking requirements. Naively if you add another, you also need a new validator set with more stake\nWhich is quite capital inefficient\nSo I was thinking if there is a way to solve this",
