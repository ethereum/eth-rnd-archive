        "content": "I think the attnets revamp will help a lot in general, at the cost of increasing bandwidth consumption for the average node across the network. I agree with mikhail, that in general I would be a lot more worried about computational complexity of the continued increase in the validator set size. At 2 million keys you run into a lot of memory and CPU constraints with regards to general block processing and more importantly epoch processing, what worked at 100 - 200k , might not be feasible with 2 million",
