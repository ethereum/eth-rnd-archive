The fight for more equal distribution of validators across clients seems to be more of a battle against status-quo bias and network effects that currently favour Prysm. \n\nAlso, if a consensus bug occurs in your minority client, the consequences are very small - no interruption to BC finality and minor inactivity penalties for you as validator. The same bug in a majority client could have major financial implications for validators and stop the BC from finalizing (or worse, with a supermajority client, finalize incorrect blocks).\n\nSo even if there was an increased risk of bugs on minority clients, the overall risk to your staked ether is probably still lower with a minority client. Id definitely prefer to be on the right side of the built-in incentivization than relying on social recovery.\n\nP.s. just my 2c, as I've been thinking on this recently too - I'm definitely not one of the EF high ups you directed this towards...",
