        "content": "re: EIP-7892 (BPO), there's one extra thing we should align on. I assume we want the CL ENR `eth2` field to announce the upcoming BPO fork under the `next_fork_*` subfields, if there is one set in the local schedule. This can only be signalled by bumping `Version`, but the current EIP draft **does not** integrate BPO forks into the `Version` series. Do we want to do this? That way we can also avoid the mix-in solution for `ForkDigest`—there'll just be an explicit version assigned to the BPO fork.\n\nIMO: I think it's cleaner for _every_ consensus-breaking fork to have a version (that includes *anonymous* BPO forks), but it'll leave version gaps in the named fork series. cc \u003c@363800010518822915\u003e \u003c@554799849288105986\u003e \u003c@755590043632140352\u003e",
