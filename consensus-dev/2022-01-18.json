        "content": "True. If majority loses funds, majority will fork. But when talking about client diversity, a bug doesn't necessarily mean you lose all your stake. I'm not a core dev, but as far I know it's quite hard to get your funds slashed. It's more likely the bugged majority will receive 2%/5% offline penalties, so there isn't enough of a loss to call for a bailout. In that way, it's still worth it to run a minority client. Although this of course doesn't apply if the infrastructure cannot follow the right chain quickly enough. If a fork is detected, how fast can MetaMask etc. point their nodes to the right chain? If they don't do it fast enough, they will commit transactions to the wrong chain and switching back to the right one would cause chaos by reversing them. In such scenario, I think most people would just stay with the wrong chain as long it doesn't have any serious bugs. So I kinda see the point that running a minority client might not be the best idea. Especially because then the minority client will be slashed, as from the wrong-chain-perspective, they went offline.",
