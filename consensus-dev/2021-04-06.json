I wanted to include a quick mention of the incentive changes coming in Altair. Is there a summary of these changes anywhere?\n\nMy current understanding of the changes is:\n1. inclusion delay reward removed, with only attestations included in the next block being counted\n2. proportion of total per-epoch reward allocated to block proposer increased from 1/32 to 1/8\n3. overall per-epoch max issuance unchanged, so the source/target/head rewards will change to keep this invariant\n\nIs that right?",
