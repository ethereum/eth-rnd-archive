I agree that slot timing partition should be reconsidered, however there isn't much slack here.  Aggregation takes up to 3-4 seconds on lower end hardware and up to 2 seconds on the usual dedicated hardware (eg a NUC) so we could in principle move attestations to 5 seconds, but anything higher should probably move the aggregation cut a little later. The problem of the latter is that it increases the chances of split views and these seem more dangerous to me than the few reorgs we are causing with this feature",

        "content": "My gut is that we might have a slack in a second part of a slot as producing attestations is not computationally intensive and disseminating them across smaller meshes should be faster than e.g. aggregates. I guess borrowing a second from the second slot part is what you're saying.\n\nIf we reduce the aggregation phase then there is a risk of some aggregates to be either submitted late or not submitted at all. If \u003e40% of aggregates are late then they can reorg a block produced in the next slot right after its proposal. I am not sure I understand your argument about additional risk of split views though.",
