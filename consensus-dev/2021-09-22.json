Each row is a specific deployment group (many small ones running by ef, then 4 ones of 17% each by client teams, and power users + smaller clients + more users + recent new deposits to grow for testing larger validator counts).\n\nThe height of each row is 32 pixels; one epoch. The x axis is epochs (left side is altair fork epoch, right side is most recent)\n\nRed = missed sync committee participation.\nBlue = good sync commitee participation.\nBlack = not elected in sync committee (512/233,046 chance per validator to be elected, smaller groups are not always running in sync committees), or validator didn't exist yet, or a block was missing.\n\nUntil recently nimbus had a bug, but it's been fixed and turned blue now (great work!). And we updated all EF nodes to catch up with latest client changes (thanks Parithosh!). The remaining red rows are Prater users who have yet to update, or are offline.\n\nTLDR: sync commitee performance of all clients on latest version is looking good!",
