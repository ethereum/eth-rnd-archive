If you require the target or head to match you'll get a bunch of false positives just because some of your nodes got the block on time and some got it late.",

This is where that sort of majority-rule could come in to play, although I'd want to run a lot of numbers first to see what the reality was (e.g. how often the majority was behind the correct state, retrospectively speaking).",
