We're fortunate to have a bunch of language examples and different engineering approaches to learn from.",

I assumed that the \"fork\" field in the state would be used for any and all upgrades that required some consensus changing logic. However, with slashing being a factor, we can only realistically update this value of few times per year (depends on weak subjectivity sync period) or risk old slashing events becoming unacceptable. Do you see this as a concern? \n\nPerhaps my assumption is incorrect. Is fork field in the state meant to be used as the universal \"current fork\" in the state of eth2?",

Another reason fork-epoch is the natural conditional.\n\nThis is valid in python and i think most languages have built in comparison operators for bytes values \n\u003e b'\\x00\\x00\\x00' \u003c b'\\x00\\x00\\x01'\n\u003e True",
