The missing blob would be returned as nil.\n- Now: if any requested blob is missing, the entire request is treated as invalid and an error is returned instead.\n\nDo you guys know which one is the expected behavior?",

If a lighthouse peer advertises something and doesn't send a response for it, its a bug that we need to fix. i'm seeing quite a few lodestar peers doing this on devnet 3 btw",

        "content": "Looking at the validator queues and the consistent increase in 0x02 validators, i think the majority of the exit queue is a combination of large stakers consolidating (since batch consolidations essentially broken) and arbitage of the stETH/ETH depeg.  I think only a minority of it is for liquidity reasons. \nThe entrance queue is the other half of these actions plus DATs staking their ETH mostly.\nI think the difficulty in consolidating many validators in a single batch tx a real issue here.  It should be possible to consolidate 64 0x01 32ETH validators into a one 2048 ETH 0x02 validator in a single tx on an accelerated pathway.  This should be a priority for network health \u0026 functionality.  Afterall,  validator consolidation for larger node operators is important for network scalability and more efficient p2p gossiping.",
