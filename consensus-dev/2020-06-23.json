But I think this is only true for Proof of Work blockchains.\n\nIt doesn't appear to be a problem for Proof of Stake because a hacker would have to buy more than 50% of all 'sidechain' tokens in order to bring down that sidechain; by the time the hacker acquires that many tokens, they would lose the incentive to bring it down... The hacker would also be the biggest shareholder of that token so their incentive would be for it to go up and not to hack it.\n\nGiven that Ethereum is moving to PoS, wouldn't it make sense to go with a multi-blockchain solution (each ERC-20 token gets its own chain) instead of sharding chains based on other attributes?\n```",

With PoS and sharding in Eth2, there is a split of load, but communication is still reasonable, and validators are shuffled between shards every now and then.",
