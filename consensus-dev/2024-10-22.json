During the last ACDC call \u003c@504202741933932544\u003e mentioned a comment by \u003c@688748669268132001\u003e which steered the disussion towards \"do not implement\", but \u003c@449019668296892420\u003e 's latest comment got a +1 from \u003c@688748669268132001\u003e , so I assume this was a non-issue and we should move forward with this. Am I right here?",
