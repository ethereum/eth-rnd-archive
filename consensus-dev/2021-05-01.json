A single bad head vote because your block proposer was late makes you lose over 1% with respect to other clients, and we are getting about 2/day/validator these days. So just a couple of bad attestations already skew this measurement a lot. Without really knowing what is statistically relevant of those measurements I would not have presented them in the way you did. Most people look at that graph and say \"oh Teku is much better than the other clients\". Regardless of what you write in the text right afterwards",
