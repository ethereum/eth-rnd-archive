Speaking on the [Chain Reaction Podcast](https://fiftyonepercent.podbean.com/e/vitalik-buterin-eth-20-driven-by-simplified-sharding-optimistic-rollups-and-native-cross-shard-communications/) Vitalik indicated that this was motivated by available CPU power on commodity hardware. This leaves me with 3 questions:\n\n1.  Does the mean CPU is the scaling bottleneck under this latest design?\n2.  Assuming CPU power continues to scale, what will be the next bottleneck?\n3.  When (meaning at what shard count) will we reach that next bottleneck?",
