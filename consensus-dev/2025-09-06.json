I think if i was to advocate any further change to consolidation, it'd likely be to remove the 'special case' and let validators go through the normal flow rather than building out special infra to handle that case.\nChanging to allow large numbers to move fast has a lot of potential implications, and the question of 'fairness' would definitely need to be considered if we went towards allowing that kind of thing.",
