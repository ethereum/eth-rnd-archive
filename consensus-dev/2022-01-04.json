In any case I just got a benchmark from a machine implementing AVX512 and it was higher than 12 times faster than the current implementation (including padding block hardcoding) in the same machine, that's actually a higher gain than native sha extensions, that aren't vectorized and I've benchmarked them at x10",

The VMs often have clever optimization tricks that don't kick in right away.  For example, it may not do a certain optimization until after GC starts happening, or until enough time has passed that it can confidently identify hotpaths.",
