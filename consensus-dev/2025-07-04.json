        "content": "Out of curiosity, is any CL client preparing the block for proposals before the start of the slot, optimistically that the head is right? I think we should probably relax and allow to count attestations for the current slot before the slot deadline. Do you see this as a blocker \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e? My intention is to anyway wait until the start of the slot, process any attestation that arrived since the optimistic check and then use the prepared block if head hasn't changed. We already do something along these lines for the honest reorg feature. We check 10 seconds into the slot if our head will change or not. I believe lighthouse does something similar at 11.5",
