It does provide some nice security benefits, for example we can reject gossip that exceeds the maximum possible size for the object type we're expecting. These very huge fields negate that benefit but there's a lot of things it does help with.",

I've written about SSZ and included some info here, https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/building_blocks/ssz, but the generalised indices section is just a stub for now as we're not really using it yet. Basically, if objects occupy a fixed number of (possibly \"virtual\") leaves in the Merkle tree then you can assign a unique index to any element of the tree. It will be super useful for light clients.",
