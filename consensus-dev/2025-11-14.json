        "content": "It is meaningless and wrongheaded.\n\nEIP 8062 is deeply flawed in that it fails to address or even analyze the root cause of the lack-of-consolidations problem that is due to the flawed design of the 0x02 validator.\n\n0x02 is flawed for two related reasons:\n\n1) It fails to recognize that many validator operators (both pro and solo) need predictible income in order to pay taxes, business and living expenses, etc.  While 0x01 validators provide this with their automated sweep feature, 0x02's need for an Ethereum transaction followed by a highly unpredictable time in a withdrawal queue (a horrible UX in itself) eliminates the predictible income nature of the 0x01 validator.\n\n2) The 2048 ETH threshold for automated sweeping is way too high.  That level is so high that each validator key would now be worth ~$10 million and the validators so large that they should probably be called whale-idators.  If the 0x02 automated sweep level had been set to 320 (or maybe 512) ETH we would have seen a far greater level of consolidation.\n\nLastly, adding the fee that is proposed in 8062 merely penalizes the solo staker and those that need predictible cashflow.  Very few solos have enough ETH to consolidate to a whale-idator in order to benefit from the automated sweep.  And those that do consolidate are now trapped by the unpredictable timing of cashflow that 0x02 demands.\n\nThe best solution to encourage consolidations is not a flawed and reactionary EIP 8062.  It is a tweak to the 0x02 validator to either a) drop the sweep threshold to 320 ETH, or b) make the sweep threshold configurable via an onchain transaction.\n\nLet's fix 0x02 before meddling via 8062.  And maybe that is as simple as a copy/paste of 0x02 into 0x03 with a 320 ETH sweep threshold.\n\nAnd why no mention of penalizing the 0x00 validators that have never migrated?",

        "content": "Making a variable sweep threshold is definitely the better solution as opposed to picking an arbitrary ETH amount. As I recall, that was the original design planned. EIP 8062 is unfair to solo validators and doesnt even address the root cause of slow consolidations. I think we will see more consolidations as the tooling improves \u0026 smart contracts get updated.",
