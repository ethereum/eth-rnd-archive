We can be told that no mathematical knowledge is needed to vet the specs, but to vet this statement in itself requires deep mathematical knowledge of the system",

        "content": "I understand this, my question is actually quite basic: The way I've been learning about governance at least in the CL of ethereum so far it has worked along the following lines after the R\u0026D stage is done (where a lot of work is put). Someone typically from the EF or from one of the client teams puts out a PR with the implementation. It goes through vetting mostly by people of the EF R\u0026D in the first rounds, and mostly by client devs in the last rounds when edge cases or performance issues are found. Everything gets merged when Danny gives the OK. My problem with  this particular PR is how many people can actually review it. I expect almost zero people in client teams to have deep knowledge of the math involved (they shouldn't need this) and taking it as a blackbox does work to vet part of it, but not to try to imagine attack vectors. In regards to \u003c@!427491045308235776\u003e 's comment: I am fine abstracting away EC cryptography that has been battle tested everywhere for over 30 years. I am not happy at all that KZG's paper is from 2010 only with less than 100 citations. At the very least you should grant me that it's a very different situation",

Not to say that pairings for example, have not received any/sufficient attention as I cannot judge. Just that the amount is vastly different at this moment in time, compared to much older cryptography",

Last week we had an exam. While they did a pretty good coding with tests/benchmarks (MCL is the fastest) I must say no one really understood how KZG10 actually works even though I spent multiple hours explaining it in informal ways. And this scheme is relatively easy to understand (except pairings).",
