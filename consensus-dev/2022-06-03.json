Using pre-signed transactions will require a trusted actor, who decides when and which validator to eject. While with the withdrawal credentials initiated exits, it seems possible to design a trustless solution.\n\nThe parts of the trustless design, for example might be:\n1) to defend against a bad-behaving validator, there could be a contract with a permissionless function: if the given validator balance is \u003c 31 ETH, eject it\n2) to satisfy a protocol user's request to withdraw the funds, the validator for ejection could be chosen on-chain, e.g., randomly",

        "content": "Delegated staking though cannot escape the reality that actually doing the work of running a node is fundamentally a human operation. Real people, with real values and priorities are making choices and decisions day in and day out about how to do the work of running Ethereum. Delegation of a stake cannot 100% abstract out that human element, so there is really is no such thing as 100% trustless delegation anyway. But allowing arbitrary withdrawal credential initiated exits can then create a dynamic where the capital provider could apply unhealthy coercion on node operators (operate the validators in xyz manner, or I'll exit everything and end your business). \n\nIf it really is a requirement to constrain a node operator - it might be best to instead have some kind of mechanism in the beacon chain that automatically exits validators after a pre-specified fixed duration term (ie after n thousand epochs), or if the balance falls below a specified threshold then have mechanisms that can cause corruption in the relationship between the capital provider and the node operator.",
