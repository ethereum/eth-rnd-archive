I kinda see where Dustin is coming from and he has a valid point: the fact that unions are in the spec can be used as leverage to include constructs that naturally use them (see the discussion around requests) and this will naturally delay SSZ adoption since major clients libraries don't even support this. I think unions in ssz have so many people that hate them (myself included and I've written two separate ssz libraries) that I would support removing them from the spec, not on the basis that they aren't used now but on the basis that I don't want them used ever.",
