There are debates on exposing more data endpoints which I don't think make sense as it is against the original idea of the proposal to reduce the complexity of becoming a state provider. Some CL clients require a full block aside the state to be bootstrapped and will need to make the change to their code (the change may be non trivial) to be able to do a fresh start with the state only. I am echoing Micah that it is unlikely to be adopted by the network before the Merge",
