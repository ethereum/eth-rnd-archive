        "content": "Hi, what is the security assumption on \"splitting attack\" in ETH2.0?\nIf an adversary has the ability to show votes to only the subsets of the next attestors immediately before they attest, the adversary can split the votes into two subtrees to prevent convergence of LMD GHOST.\nFor example, if two conflicting blocks (`b1` and `b2`) at the same height have the scores (about LMD GHOST) with a small difference, the adversary shows votes for the block with the smaller score which fill the gap of the scores to a certain set of attestors, making the scores at tie at the next slot. By repeating this, the adversary can keep the tie.\n(In LMD GHOST, the adversary must decide which votes he shows and to whom more carefully than in a normal GHOST since the scores do not grow monotonically but it's possible to calculate.)\n\nFor an adversary to perform this attack, the adversary needs to\n(1) know (the public key of) the next attestors before they send attestations\n(2) identify the node with a public key\nAlso, (3) the network must be predictable enough (e.g. the message delay is smaller than 1 slot) so that the adversary can calculate the effects of splitting on the scores at the next slot.\n\nLocal attestor election with private randomness (e.g. VRF) workarounds (1) but ETH2.0 uses public randomness. The adversary can learn about (2) by observing the network for a while.\n\nEven if the adversary only has a partial knowledge about (1) and (2) the network is slightly unstable, the adversary would have some randomized strategies to make a successful attack probabilistically.",

We'll be demonstrating a functional ETH 2.0 network running on the Whiteblock Genesis platform aka making that dev lyfe easier. Anyone is welcome, we'd love to have you.\n\nSign up here: https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_GjWAB_7qQUyN67gIQ43YDg\n\n- Understand how nodes function and behave in a live distributed network.\n\n- Learn more about Ethereum 2.0's roadmap as we discuss future challenges.\n\n- Identify different approaches in engineering and the testing methodology used.\n\n- Figure out how you can leverage Whiteblock's free and open-source framework to build better blockchain systems.\n\n- Q\u0026A session with the Whiteblock team and ETH2.0 implementers.",

With the freeze, the spec changed domains to be defined as bytes8 rather than uint64. Previously this uint64 had to be changed back into bytes in the BLS libraries, including the one used for the testing infrastructure (py_ecc). This conversion was still in big-endian, as opposed to the spec'd little-endian behavior.",
