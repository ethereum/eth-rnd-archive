It seems that validating all the block BLS signatures (including attestations and randao) in all blocks seriously restricts the sync performance.\n\nMy gut feeling is that while importing pretty large blocks chain (say several epochs +) validating just block signatures shouldn't mitigate security too much. Going further it could be sufficient to validate just a random subset of blocks (like it is done in Eth1 Fast sync: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/1889).",

You cannot bypass any after.\nAnother good technique to look into is using the \"fast verification\" trick across series of blocks instead of just within a single block (https://ethresear.ch/t/fast-verification-of-multiple-bls-signatures/5407). I think lighthouse has integrated this into their sync protocol",

To justify whether suggested checkpoint is the one, in the first iteration peer gets a proof that the majority of peers in the network sharing this checkpoint as the most recent finalized one. In the second iteration the peer could observe the votes of the majority, if they are voting for the chain that is built upon that checkpoint then it must be the canonical one. But the second iteration is possible only when peer has access to the validator registry.\n\nSo, the strategy would be as follows. Sync to the commonly shared finalized checkpoint in the network. Get a proof that validators keep voting on it and that their votes are valid. Won't it be secure enough to avoid checking any signatures prior to the finalized checkpoint?",
