This has inherent and unnecessary risk to the user. Having a different recovery mnemonic for cold storage means that I only ever need to access this data in the event that I want to use my withdrawal wallet and prevents a total loss via theft if someone were to gain access to my hot key mnemonic.\n\u003c@!399309815517544451\u003e with an hardware wallet this shouldn't be the case, you could derive it internally.\nYou could use a different derivation branch for withdrawal keys but that will disconnect the withdrawal key from the validation key as it is now.",
