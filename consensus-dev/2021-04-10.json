I have seen some efforts towards this. Beaconcha.in has a somewhat objective list in their site with a classification of pools. The \"Due diligence committee\" is supposedly studying them and  has reports on different pools https://ethddc.org/ but I have some reservations about that project (and I have read many do as well)",
