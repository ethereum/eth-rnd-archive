I've been reading on all the requirements for running a validator on eth2, and noticed this on https://launchpad.ethereum.org/checklist\n\n```\nFor example, you need at least 140 GB SSD to run geth fast sync on mainnet.\n```\n\n---\n\nAFAICT you must be running an ETH1 node (for example Geth), and Geth definitely takes much more than 140 GB SSD. A new node takes around 290 GB... and only grows from there on... how does one run a Geth node today with just 140GB SSD? Maybe I am missing something?",
