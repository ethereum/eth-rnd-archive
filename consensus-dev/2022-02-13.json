With many people using e.g. infura or other centralized endpoints, those might be on the minority chain.",

You're never going to get a definitive answer of what a governance decision will be ahead of time because Ethereum is decentralised there's no one to make such an authoritative statement. But as \u003c@!397389662085185547\u003e pointed out, majority of validators doesn't mean majority of economic value and validators are the new miners - they're not the point of the chain and very replaceable, so it's always going to be economic value that matters.\n\nA couple of questions I find help reason about this:\n * If stakers don't lose money for doing the wrong thing, what's the basis for security in PoS?\n * If we'd really just follow the majority client in the case of a chain split, why are we investing all this time and money building multiple clients?",

With one client representing a supermajority aren't we already sacrificing much of the benefit behind having mulitple clients?",

Not sure that increasing the finalization requirement is necessarily a good plan - if we have highly uneven client usage then we still have problems and ultimately we need to do something to get to a more even spread, not just keep shifting goal posts to avoid (potential) disaster.\n\nIt's very important to note that no exchange is running any CL client as part of their actual exchange operation (ie for following transactions) because the CL doesn't have anything to do with transactions until the merge. Clear communication of the risks of using a single client to verify off-chain transactions now is likely the right result so they design a setup that doesn't put them at risk.",
