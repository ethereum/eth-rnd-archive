Here's my POV: I think in some ways coinbase listing ETH2 is helping reduce the potential for scams. \n\nWe're already in a world where 'Ethereum 2' is the widely accepted terminology across most platforms to describe the set of upgrades happening, and I think trying to reverse that will be near impossible and potentially harmful (if you walk back on the messaging, it might cause even more confusion). This means inevitably, like you implied, a large group of people will try to buy/susceptible to falling for whatever this new ‘ETH 2’ asset is. \n\nBy coinbase listing ETH2, I think it achieves a couple of things: \n- When people try to buy ethereum 2, they’ll look it up on Coinbase or Google, and find the ETH2 listing on Coinbase that tells them ETH2 is not available to trade yet. \n- When people try to scam others into buying fake ETH2, regular users now have an ETH2 page on Coinbase that can be easily referenced to protect them. \n\nI know it’s not perfect, but coinbase is kind of filling in the knowledge gap that exists already. I think potential room for improvement and collaboration is on the coinbase ETH2 listing page. People will inevitably end up on this page. What do you guys want people to read/see on this page?",
