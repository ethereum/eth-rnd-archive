But I thought I'd give you a quick return that may help you until someone gives you a full answer. The quoted sentence: \n\u003e The penalties for missing the head, target and source votes are equal to the rewards the attestor would have received had they submitted them. \nIs indeed false, we do not penalize for missing head, missing head is not something that it's up to the attester since Altair, the next proposer may simply not propose, or not include the right attestation and that would be enough to miss head, so it was decided to not penalize the missing of head here. Although people can argue that not getting the reward is already tough enough.",
