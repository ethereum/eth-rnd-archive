It's a simple way to reference specification items (functions, containers, presets, etc) in your codebase. When paired with a CI check, spec tags can act as a notification that some specification item has been changed. It also serves as a useful development tool when implementing new specifications.\n\nIf adopted by clients, the security team has a few neat ideas on how it could be utilized for security purposes. With spec tags, (1) locating important code is easy, (2) it's possible to automatically compile a list of upgrade-specific items to review, and (3) we could make a system which automatically compares client code to the specification.\n\nI'm very open to feedback, please share anything that would make this better.",
