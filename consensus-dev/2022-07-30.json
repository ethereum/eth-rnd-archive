I always assumed that the reason for fixed size validators was that it made things easier by having discrete units of validators.  However, if a validator can operate with anywhere between 16 and 32 ETH and their votes/rewards/penalties are weighted by that, I no longer understand why we constrain validators to [16,32] rather than just having a 16 ETH minimum and unbounded maximum.",

However, I don't think it says anything about uncapped maximum validator stakes. Obviously, if a decrease in staking requirements were to be combined with a increase in staking maximum, there would be a pull from both sizes: smaller holders **increasing** the validator set by adding new validators and bigger holders **decreasing** the validator set by combining their multiple 32 ETH nodes into fewer validators with a bigger stake.\n\nAlso, if I remember right, there were some talks about capping the active validator set in general, which would solve the overhead problem. And to solve the problem of excluding people in case the validator set is full (though it's unclear whether it's a problem, as according to vbuterin nodes, even a 8 ETH minimum would still enable ~1mil validators without causing overhead, which is a lot and might be sufficient for stakers), there could be a large \"offline\" set of validators and then the current active validator set would be picked randomly from those.",
