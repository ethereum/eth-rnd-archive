From my reading of the spec, and assuming that all validators have an effective balance of 32 Ether, if a validator is slashed then it receives a penalty equal to ~3% (1 Ether) plus an additional penalty which goes from 0 to 100% of its remaining Ether as the number of other validators also slashed within the same 4K epoch window (2K either side of when the validator was slashed) goes from 0 to 33% of total validators.  Is this correct?",
