Without this key funds cannot be withdrawn so it is extremely important to keep it safe. \n\nAnd whatever they actually do is also beside the point. I'm saying that whomever is in control of the withdrawal credentials should have the ability to exit, and that this comes without loss of trust. I can only see it helping with e.g. avoiding staking service providers keeping funds hostage.\n\nI can't think of any situation where \"withdrawal credentials + exit ability\" leads to e.g. stealing of funds compared to just \"withdrawal credentials\".",
