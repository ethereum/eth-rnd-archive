One would have to verify state transition starting from genesis as well, which is basically re-verifying everything.",

It includes two small changes for Fulu, several improvements in Gloas specs, and lots of general repo improvements. This release contains a notable change to how reference tests are published. Due to a persistent issue, the reference test tarballs (eg `mainnet.tar.gz`) are now available in the consensus-specs release assets. For most clients, I expect this will be a relatively simple change but please reach out if you encounter any problems.",

        "content": "Except that you can verify the hash of the finalized checkpoint against trusted sources which verifies the entire chain history by inference _except_ the block signatures since they're not part of the block hash. So a p2p node could send you a historic block with valid content but invalid signature and you'd blindly import it and then get incorrect responses from the REST API.\nWhy anyone would do that or why you'd care is an open question. I suspect for public API providers (Alchemy/Infura/etc) they probably would want to verify all the signatures to ensure all responses are correct, for home users they probably don't care. So making verification optional makes a lot of sense.",
