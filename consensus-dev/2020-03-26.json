Going further it could be sufficient to validate just a random subset of blocks (like it is done in Eth1 Fast sync: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/1889).\nWith assumption that proposers are randomly elected and that honest proposer never signs off on the incorrect block, the following could be used to evaluate a number of blocks required to be tested. Suppose a half of validators are malicious then `p = 0.5 ** N`, where `p` is the probability of `N` blocks produced by malicious validators. For instance, with `N = 1000` the probability is `9e-302`. \n\nIn other words, verifying proposer signatures of a thousand blocks that are randomly sampled is enough to say whether chain is valid or not, even if half of validators are malicious. Am I missing anything?",

I can provide a chain where I just skip the slots that I'm not producing. In those blocks that I produce I can arbitrarily eject other validators since the slashing signatures are not being checked. With this I can begin to increase my share of the validator set. Once I have ~50%, I can start owning eth1 voting and then begin to induct validators at will.",

When the canonical chain observes the alternative one it will slash validators if their votes are in the weak subjectivity period. But if you're eclipsed you won't see those slashings.\n\nTo be sure that the checkpoint you're chasing is the canonical one, you need to be sure that it's been finazlied by the canonical set of validators. If you observe two alternative checkpoints you may look for slashing messages to decide which one to follow. But if you're eclipsed you could be eclipsed with valid chain which is not the canonical one.\n\nWhat do you think about requesting the most recent finalized checkpoint out of band? I remember there was a discussion related to weak subjectivity period, it was about requesting a root at the weak subjectivity period out of band to initiate the sync. Probably, we could request finalized head as well? It seems that those participants that have been online for a reasonably long time can make a much better justification about the canonical chain.",
