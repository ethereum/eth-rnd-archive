It seems to me that it is not so easy to notice one attestation is a duplicate of another, for example, lets say I have an attestation A with validator 1 and 3 in the aggregation_bits and their aggregated signature, and an Attestation B with with validator only validator 1. How do people notice that the attestation B can be disregarded since attestation A is a superset of it?",

Even with millions of aggregations, verifying a partition's correctness is possible on a small machine. Handel's approach is to structure the validators into a 'binary' tree structure.",
