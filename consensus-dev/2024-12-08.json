        "content": "Hi guys, I have been investigating EIP-4881(Deposit Snapshot) recently, and found that the finalization logic depends on `eth1_deposit_index`, which will be anchored to certain value in the near future. After EIP-6110 fully manages the deposit process via execution requests, deposits (in each CL's deposit cache) would be never finalized, thus there's no pruning deposits at all.\nI raised an issue regarding to this(https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/14698), and wonder there's any context or talk about EIP-4881 these days. Feedbacks are welcomed (in case I totally misunderstood the spec)",
