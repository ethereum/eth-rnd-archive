        "content": "I understand the technical benefits of this approach but I still prefer the idea of having independent blockchains connected to each other loosely though a distinct set of DEX validators (who have distinct incentives from blockchain validators). This approach can still be secure if you have complete on-chain transparency and a good level of decentralization of DEX validators.\n\nI like the idea that a token's fate should be intertwined with the fate of its infrastructure.\nSo if a token loses all of its value, nodes can stop allocating resources towards maintaining the history of that token and they can re-allocate their resources towards maintaining the history of other more relevant tokens.",
