Lido is in the process of upgrading their smart contracts to start consolidations. I also feel like we should talk to stakers and give more time for them to consolidate before making changes that may penalize smaller solo stakers like a 0x01 withdrawal fee.\n\nAll things being equal,  I think any additional dev bandwidth for Glamsterdam on the consensus side should be focused towards higher impact upgrades with strong community buy-in and urgency such as FOCiL.",

It will of course reduce the effective consolidation throughput as some of it is taken up by exits, but I am not sure if we care about this from the perspective of reducing the validator set size, because at the end of the day an exit does that too (so whichever consolidation throughput we lose to exits shouldn't really hurt us in that sense, except for stake that ends up being re-deposited without even consolidating, which seems probably marginal in practice and also bounded by the deposit cap)",
