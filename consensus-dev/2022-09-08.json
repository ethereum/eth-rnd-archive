I hope this will be possible and that's why I'm testing the client.\n\nI don't want this to sound like \"Whataboutism\" now, but we have much bigger security issues in my opinion. The `staking-deposit-cli` (\u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases/tag/v2.3.0\u003e) is hosted on GitHub without signature. The `SHA256 Checksum` shown there is useless and gives users a false feeling of security. We are basically trusting `GitHub.com` and every person who has access to this account.\n\nI would really prefer the `staking-deposit-cli` to be signed by multiple client teams maybe or at least the checksum to be posted at multiple locations. It should clearly be communicated that people need to check the authenticity  of the `staking-deposit-cli` by using multiple locations. (The same as checking the checkpoint by using multiple locations.)\n\nThere is already an open issue, but no progress. \u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/issues/119\u003e",
