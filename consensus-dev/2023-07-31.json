We can already see that the spec tests will be extremely useful in the process, but we wanted to get some feedback on how to use them. We have two options:\n1. Building the core algorithms for phase 0 until the phase 0 spec tests run, and then move on to the next one, so we can focus on one set of features at a time.\n2. Starting with the later test specs directly and just selecting subsets of tests to run at a time.\n\nThe advantage of the first option is that it's simpler and more control, but at the same time, that would mean implementing the changes for a phase, and then reworking and possibly rewriting parts for the next one each time.\n\nWhat do you think? Did you encounter this decision? What are your thoughts about it?",
