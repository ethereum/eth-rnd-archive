What do you do if say you are proposing at n+1, the block in n comes late, it builds on top of the canonical chain but it's a self orphaning block that has less than 10% attestations but includes a lot of attestations for a competing branch enough to make that branch head. You decide to fork it because it has less than 10%? And if so, what's the head you build on top? I'm very puzzled by these things cause any algorithm I can think for these is exploitable by an attacker that knows that prysm is proposing in the next slot",
