Has there been any consideration of increasing the rate that penalties ramp up when multiple validators are slashed rather than moving the base penalty back up?  I suspect people are going to keep getting themselves slashed accidentally so would be good to keep the cost of that low if we can still maintain a high cost for coordinated attacks",
