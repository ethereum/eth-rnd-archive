Register on meetup.com for this event: https://www.meetup.com/ethereum-engineering/events/269880527/\n\u003e For those of you who can't be on the call due to timezones, the slides and video will be posted on our youtube channel shortly after the talk. The abstract for the talk is: \n\u003e The Eth2.0 specifications are the specifications for next generation of Eth2 clients.\n\u003e Ensuring that the specifications are bug-free, consistent, and unambiguous is instrumental in creating a trustworthy Ethereum ecosystem.\n\u003e In this talk, we present our work on the formal verification of the Eth2.0 specifications phase 0. We use the verification-aware programming language Dafny to write specifications, implementations, and the proofs that the implementations satisfy the specifications.\n\u003e We will introduce the basics of the Dafny formal verification framework and illustrate how it can be applied to specify, debug, fix and prove the correctness of core functionalities of the Eth2.0 specifications.\n \nThe recording of this talk is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCSwkUQO_no",
