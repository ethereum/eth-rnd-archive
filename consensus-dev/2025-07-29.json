        "content": "Dear Ethereum researchers,\n\nMy name is Dmitry, and I represent Ethereum Home Stakers from Lido CSM. Today I want to raise a topic of the super node requirements in PeerDAS. As we can see in the amazing description of the PeerDAS (https://peerdas.net/), currently, all CL nodes with 128+ validators (or 4096 ETH if we are talking 0x02) are required to be \"[super nodes](https://hackmd.io/@manunalepa/peerDAS/%2Fe3UGeZ7cS92uk8b1SeVSyw%3Fstext%3D3655%253A10%253A0%253A1753797721%253A6Eir_Z%26view%3D)\". This number comes from the simple paradigm - 1 validator (32 ETH) = 1 data sample. Since we have 128 data samples in PeerDAS, we end up with the requirement to run a CL super node if there are 128 or more validators attached (or 4096+ ETH corresponding to the attached validators).\n\nThis requirement might potentially be problematic for Ethereum Home Stakers running CSM, Rocket Pool, or any other Home Staker solution that allows operators to spin up full validators with less than 32 of their own ETH. With CSM specifically, one can run 128 0x01 validators with ~167 ETH, which is equivalent to about five solo validators. While this number might seem large, from my experience, I know many Home Stakers with 200+ ETH that they use to run validators in CSM, Rocket Pool, or other protocols.\n\nWith the current `blobLimit`, this should not be a major problem since the storage requirement will increase just by 96 GB for the super node and will even decrease for some non-super nodes. What concerns me is the likely future increases of the `blobLimit` and their effect on both super and non-super nodes operated by Home Stakers.",

        "content": "The current `blobLimit` is 6. But after Fusaka, this limit can be increased without a hardfork. I heard that there are plans to increase it to 42 or even more. Let's examine the impact of a potential increase of the blobLimit to 42 regarding the storage and bandwidth requirements for two nodes: a super node with 128 validators and an average CSM node with 25 validators (32.7 ETH worth of bond in CSM).\n\nWith the current value of 6 for the `blobLimit`, we have:\n- Super node: `~192 GB` storage, `~384 kB/sec` bandwidth\n- Average CSM node: `~38 GB` storage, `~75 kB/sec` bandwidth\n\nWith the theoretical value of 42 for the `blobLimit`, we have:\n- Super node: `~1,344 GB` storage, `~2,688 kB/sec` bandwidth\n- Average CSM node: `~266 GB` storage, `~525 kB/sec` bandwidth\n\nOne can see that even for the average CSM Node, we have a significant increase in both disk space required (from the current `~96 GB` to `~266 GB`, effectively making 2TB SSD setups unusable) and bandwidth (from the current `~192 kB/sec` to `~525 kB/sec`). For the super node, the requirements are basically unreachable for the average Home Staking hardware.\n\nSo, while the average CSM node operated by a Home Staker can initially benefit from PeerDAS, they will face meaningful difficulties with possible increases in `blobLimit`. The situation with the super node effectively limits the ability for the average Home Staker to scale up operations and use more ETH in Home Staking.\n\nGiven that, I want to ask researchers if there is a chance to increase the validator count (ETH locked under validators) attached to the CL node from the current 128 to ~1000?\n\nWhile I'm not aware of all of the limitations and considerations behind the chosen value of 128 validators, I heavily need input from Ethereum researchers.",
