The hash and increment approach will be deprecated after standardization so the bug is to be untouched for now_\n\nSignificant changes still expected as we standardize BLS12-381 across blockchains\"\n\nIs this new info or are we still on track to finalize spec after IETF meeting?",

It was decided to leave it like that untill the standardiastion efforts have enshrined the new hash-to-curve to prevent spec chrun. The intention is to update the specs as soon as the standard is agreed upon.",
