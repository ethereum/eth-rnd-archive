They were very useful not only regarding the general direction, but also about the caveats. We'll fortunately not be implementing any p2p details ourselves, we'll only make a wrapper from elixir to the go implementation (the team already made progress on node discovery with this approach 🥳 ).\n\nWe'll definitely use spec tests as a way to make sure we're not missing anything logic-wise, but we'll load-test the node separately to make sure that any time-intensive tasks are covered.",

        "content": "We're now working on SSZ in elixir. Is there any interest or team working on a language-agnostic schema definition for the ethereum types? Other serialization mechanisms like AVRO have JSON schema definitions that then can be used by any language to either generate code or generate maps/dictionaries dynamically. It would be very interesting to have something like this, as it would allow us to have a universal schema definition in something like JSON and then implementers would mostly need to take care about SSZ encoding decoding, and not also in coding each specific type.\n\nAlso, let me know if there's a better channel for this question!",
