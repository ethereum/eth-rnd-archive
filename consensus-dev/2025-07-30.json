I don't think it'd really need to be in the headers, and Im not super opinionated about version information, but would like to at least include a code per client (including vouch and others if theres similar things that build blocks up)\nThe aim of this would be to have a large majority of blocks counted (like 90% or more). Ideally if we do this, we would be able to fairly reliably tell client distribution amongst consensus clients. If it's in blocks and on by default, we would hopefully expect far better sample sizes than we see today through other means.\nIm sure this would be more clean with stable containers in place first, but I also think its worth starting a discussion and maybe logging an EIP if we decide it's worth going further...",
