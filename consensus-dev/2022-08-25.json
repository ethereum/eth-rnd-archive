But even on the mainnet participation rate isn't 100% which reflects either asynchrony or other issue with different validators, there are missed slots too which pushes us further from this theoretical statement.\n\nOn testnets with much lower participation rates (which I am using now as an indicator of various issues) than on the mainnet situations with reorg is even worse. Mainnet post-Merge should be much more stable in that regard",
