I have a question about randomness in Beam Chain.\nIn his keynote at Devcon, Justin mentioned that there's a plan to replace the current RANDAO system with MinRoot, a VDF, for generating randomness.\nHowever, in 2023, the EF’s cryptography research team pointed out some vulnerabilities in MinRoot:\nhttps://ethresear.ch/t/statement-regarding-the-public-report-on-the-analysis-of-minroot/16670\n\nGiven that, I’d like to ask:\nHas there been any progress in VDF research since then, making it more realistic to implement in Ethereum?\nOr is it possible that Beam Chain will just continue using RANDAO as it is?\nAlternatively, are there any other approaches being considered?",
