If I understand correctly then from an application perspective it does still make sense to count confirmations (as it was usually done with PoW) as a less secure but faster algorithm to establish \"finality\", right? Circle still seems to do it https://developers.circle.com/developer/docs/confirmations",

With no missed slots 12 slots = 2.4min, where 12 pre-merge block times are indeed 12min.\n\nIn PoW the economic security guarantee of a block increases somewhat linearly with each new block. In Ethereum PoS it's more complicated, with more instances of very non-linear behavior. For example this post explains a patched issue of the fork-choice that allowed 10 slot deep re-orgs at low cost https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/05/03/secured-5-disclosures-update",
