We can lower `base_reward` accordingly so that the overall issuance stays the same. But by paying the dormant validators no one will complain by being dormant and while active we still have encouragement to attest correctly. At the same time, there's no incentive on active validators to delay finality or any bad play to stay active, since being dormant is better",
