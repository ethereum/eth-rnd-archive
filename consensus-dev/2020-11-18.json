And I see plenty of untouched `ldb` files since my initial sync on my chaindata folder. At this rate of growing from the hot dbase I'll run out of space in a couple of months. Will try symlinking those ldb files to the freezer before or a copydb perhaps. But I'd like to get at least statistics or what is the expected normal behaviour between freezer size and hot dbase size. Cannot get any info on the geth discord and it seems to me that any question about size on the repo gets closed with essentially a \"worksforme\" and no answer.",

At the same time, users can try v1 on this testnet.\nWe could keep Pyrmont up and running for longer, there are different opinions about this. Something I'd like to have long-term is a better testnet UX: faster validator entry/exit, so participating is not as slow and difficult.",
