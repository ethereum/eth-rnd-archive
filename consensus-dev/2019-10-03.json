If you saw a bunch of epochs that werent bolded and then one that was, might mean the chain had trouble for a bit, but from the perspective of finality, they are all finalized",

And meanwhile the githbub plan is still fronting a lot of bandwidth (we bought some a while ago, but it ran out super quick, like under an hour quick), and I am sure they are starting to be done with us, as someone reported to have problems pulling down through LFS.\n\nHave a look at this graph:",
