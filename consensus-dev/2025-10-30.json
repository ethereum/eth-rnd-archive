This release is mostly focussed around improving the Gloas specifications \u0026 testing. To be clear, it does not set the upgrade schedule for Fulu as discussed at ACDC today. Please take a moment to review the [Set fork epoch \u0026 blob schedule for Fulu](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4689) PR. We are planning to make the stable v1.6.0 release as soon as it's merged 🙂",
