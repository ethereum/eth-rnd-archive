        "content": "~~Hello, I tend to avoid API discussions, but this one actually bothers me. The `dependent_root` in the spec is defined as `get_block_root_at_slot(state, compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch) - 1)` for the current epoch and similarly for the previous epoch.  Nodes typically have very much handy the target root which would be `get_block_root_at_slot(state, compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch))`. Now this root already commits to the previous one therefore it gives actually more information and it is faster to acccess than the one the spec specifies. \n- Question 1: would any REST VC be broken if we return these roots instead of the `-1` ones?\n- Question 2: Can we please change these API endpoints to point to these roots instead?~~",
