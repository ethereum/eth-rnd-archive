I have some questions in Phase 0 \u0026 Other Phases \n\nI hope you can help me understand them better\n\nAs mentioned in the spec there will be 32 Slots in 1 Epoch and 32 committee in one Slot\n\nOne Committee is assigned to one Shard\n\nso that mean we have 32 * 32 = 1024 SHARD in one epoch\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nQ1: How many Block Proposer will be there in one slot ? will it be 1 Block Proposer or there will be 32 Block Proposer in one slot\n\n\nAnd What about .. Beacon chain ? \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nQ 2: will there be a separate Block Proposer for Beacon chain?\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nQ3 :- As every validator has one vote in one Epoch, Does that mean one Shard will only generate one Block in One Epoch?\n\n-----------------------------------\nQ4 :- As there are 32 committee is in one Slot ,, That mean 32 Committees are working on 32 Shards in one slots. \n\nDoes that mean 32 shards will work in Parallel in one slot? if yes then the scaling should be 32 times and not 1024 times? Correct",

It's one committee per shard =\u003e 64 shards total.\nQ1: One block proposer per shard per slot, drawn from the shard committee (64 committees =\u003e 64 shards). A separate single block proposer per slot for the beacon chain.\nQ2: Yes.\nQ3: Voting != proposing. Every shard generates one block every slot when things are running correctly.\nQ4: 64 shards working in parallel. Each shard is \"fatter\" than Eth1 in a sense. Eth1 processes about 3KB data per second; Eth2 will process between 1 and 4 MB per second. That's where the ~1000x comes from. An older design had 1024 slimmer shards, but that has been deprecated. 64 fatter shards now.",
