        "content": "When I consider the fact that 1500 ETH was mentioned some years ago when talking about ETH2 validator requirements, I think that 32 ETH is a great comprise towards ensuring decentralization and that less rich parties can participate. The work put behind ensuring that it is not as beneficial to run 100x that amount (even less beneficial, as you increase your slashing risk) makes me confident in the design rationale. In most other PoS-chains (DPoS especially), the concentration of tokens ends up in a few hands, because it makes more financially sense for holders to delegate to large validators, than running them yourself (Cosmos, Cardano, Polkadot etc.). This works the other way around when it comes to decentralization.",
