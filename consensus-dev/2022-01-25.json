        "content": "It's a much more complicated situation. Having somebody in the team who understands the schemes used is only a small part of the deal. Then you need somebody who can do a fast implementation (optimizations often are at asm level) with crossplatform, parallelism support, maybe even some formal verification, and all the other bells whistles that are expected nowadays. Even then you just have an implementation that the team believes they understand how it works. So a lot of effort and resources are spent until the point where we even don't know how secure is it. Then many cryptoanalysis dudes need to investigate both the theoretical scheme and the implementation in order to find the weaknesses. Does it all sound realistic to do it independently for each team? That's the answer to why the majority of clients simply use BLST.\n\nAnd 10 years is super mature given how competitive is the space. Look at what is going on with ZK proofs for arithmetics circuits. New ZK rollups are based on schemes proposed last year and optimizations discovered yesterday. The hotter it is - the more money the market throws into it.",

        "content": "I may have a recording stored on the disk. Will post if I find it. But I would say that in order to understand the scheme you need to take a mid-level explanation (not the original paper and not the ELI5). https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html is a great example of mid-level explanation. It lacks some general background, so you will need to discover it yourself elsewhere. But it's not too formal like the original papers where you may find yourself lost completely. So after reading mid-level explanation many times and exploring the missing parts elsewhere you have a high chance to have a really good understanding.",
