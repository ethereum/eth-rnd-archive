Does lookahead apply to block proposer selection or does it only apply to commitee selection. in the spec in the image it says it does not apply. but then in the spec, i see the `get_beacon_proposer_index`. using the `get_seed` function which applies lookahead.\nAppreciate the help. Possibly would be cool for this to be clear in the spec",
