The validating keys is a BLS public key, and then there's the withrawal credentials that are a hash of an unrelated public key, either BLS or ETH1. If you have the unhashed public withrawal key or it's private key, you can check that it corresponds to the withrawal credentials. But neither of them has anything to do with the validating key",
