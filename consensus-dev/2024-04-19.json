My understanding is that it listens to every attestation in its subnet, and aggregate any attestation that has the same view (head, source, target) as the aggregator itself. Does it just ignore/discard all other attestations that have a different view? For block proposer, for each subnet (committee), it *should* just pick 1 of the ~16 `SignedAggregateAndProof` with the most number of validators and shove it into body.attestations right?",

To be frank I don' t understand why the aggregator is required to submit an aggregate for his own view. I would have thought that it is more robust to send the **best aggregate** even if it does not coincide with your view as long as it's valid. Proposers can also aggregate those aggregates if possible and pack them more.",
