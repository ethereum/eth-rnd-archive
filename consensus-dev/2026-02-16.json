I understand the intent but i have concerns on how it translates in practice in clients code.\nThere is a clear interaction with gossip rules which already deal with equivocation and makes not possibile in practice to have equivocating blocks on slot N in the store when it is time to propose slot N+1.\nThus I believe that check should be based on gossip rules data structures rather than store. Which opens a testability issue: reference tests based on the current spec will fail on clients, and the actual path wont be tested (cose IIRC gossip rules are not covered by reference tests).\n\nWDYT?",
