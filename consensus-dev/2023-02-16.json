        "content": "I am trying to raise this internally on prysm without much success but I feel that I will get more traction as time goes by. I want to remove MeV boost support from prysm starting at the Capella fork. Originally I wanted this to be a joint decision from CL teams. Now I don´t really care anymore, it's completely irresponsible to start thinking on hard fork epochs without having tested the path that 95% of our blocks will pass by. I am hoping to raise awareness of this critical situation and I would want the dev community to voice about this. I consider the arguments about forks of official clients completely bogus. The bottom line is this: \n\nI do not want a piece of software that has my signature (even if in minor parts and a small percentage of actual code)  to be released without having been tested.",

I know all of these people are already very busy with other things, so it might help if we could pay them for their time",
