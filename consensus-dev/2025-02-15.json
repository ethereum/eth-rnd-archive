The tool is great but to make it most effective the spec needs to strive to have minimalistic helpers that don't perform more than one task and so that clients can implement some of them verbatim or close in an idiomatic way",

Then when the upstream code in the annotation changes, you'd be alerted for all the pieces of code that point to it, regardless of how granular the upstream change is. I think the spirit of this is to make sure you notice when things change and to avoid copy/pasting spec code that can itself go stale - rely on the humans looking at the source to figure out how things match between spec and implementation.",
