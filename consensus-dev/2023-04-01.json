It's just too much baggage to carry around that we will never ever ever under no circumstance even on acid, need. It's fine to support PoW networks, it's fine to support merged-at-genesis networks, but having clients supporting another merge is just ridiculous. We can't deprecate it right now on prysm cause we don't backfill, so the only way to sync historical data is by forward syncing from genesis, but as soon as the backfill code is merged, I'm gonna be lobbying to getting rid completely of codes like `is_execution_enabled` mentioned above.
