Probably keep beacon and validator client as-is. But it's a change that impacts users - old commands no longer work and new names have to be learned - and I'd like to make it only once.",

Execution Environment is the term that YP introduces when reads about execution model but it rather the environment itself than something that user interacts with. There is also a term \"execution agent\" in the YP which is pretty close to execution client. After the merge, Ethereum node will consist of the following pieces:  consensus (beacon chain) client and execution client; validators will have to run validator client as well.",
