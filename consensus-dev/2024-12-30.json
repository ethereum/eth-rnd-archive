Would the clients consume them? Would we add a new CI job (and new test runner) to consume them?\n- What sort of infra/resources are needed to run these generators?\n- I'm not able to find concrete commands to generate the tests, could someone point me in the right direction? Perhaps with some examples of what needs to go into the CI?",
