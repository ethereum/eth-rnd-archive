Let's say there is a generic function that is used to operate both phase 0 and phase 1 structs. At some point, a developer makes a subtle change in that function because of the phase 1 spec update. Developer either forgets to branch the behaviour for phase 0, either thinks that the update have no effect for phase 0. The change was subtle enough that phase 0 regression tests *confirm* there is no regression.\n\nMy main motivation for code isolation is that phase 0 client after the fork is fully frozen. No more changes needed for both code and data (blocks etc.) on phase 0. So a *hard copy* makes sense comparing to some nicely DRY-ed approach (generics etc.). But I guess it will be clear how good is this approach only after trying it.",
