Kind of what Prysm had to extend their discord with after they grew so large. Managing a lot of users and governance is difficult, and noisy for developers at best. I very much appreciate users and governance, but extending this R\u0026D discord right now would hurt Eth2 more than it would help any kind of decision making process. That said, there are many other channels, and if there's a need for it right now, those could be used.",
