This would provide an instant feedback on users transactions, without having to wait for block to be propised and validated. Might not be best over P2P but perhaps they could send to a specific destinations. Worst case the block proposer is lying and the users have to wait for block to be submitted and validated, but best case the block proposer is honest and users can instantly have an idea of what the next state will be for the things they care about. If baked into clients, perhaps this could be 99% reliable and could lead to great ux improvements for dapps. This is something roll-up and validium operators can do in most cases, giving their users a near instant \"confirmation\" on their txs and the state transitions.\n \nThis is not possible with PoW since the miner of new block is always unknown until block is mined.",
