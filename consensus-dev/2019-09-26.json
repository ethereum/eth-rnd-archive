Until crosslink and FFG votes are valid attestation is proved to be onchain. I.e. even if LMD-GHOST vote is invalid or its source is unknown which are equal states in the context of state transition attestation should be included anyway to facilitate finality and crosslinking. Therefore, proposer is rewarded for all attestations which carries valid crosslink and FFG votes.\n\nYou have raised an interesting question. Effectively, it means that proposer may not run checks involving `beaconBlockRoot`, only make sure that crosslink and checkpoints are valid wrt a beacon state of the head.",

An attestation gets rewarded for \"correct source\", \"correct target\", \"correct head\", \"correct crosslink\", and \"inclusion distance\" all discretely so. (correct meaning wrt to the chain it is included in). The proposer gets rewarded based on \"inclusion distance\" as long as the attestation has the correct source",
