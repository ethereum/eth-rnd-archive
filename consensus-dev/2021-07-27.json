The standard APIs (supported by all other clients, and soon Prysm) are documented here: https://ethereum.github.io/eth2.0-APIs/\nWhat you can do is query `/eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validators` (with status filter), to get validators (and filter by slashed/not-slashed, active or not, etc.), then sum their effective balances. To get participant numbers I'm afraid the standard API doesn't offer what you want. The lighthouse API has some good API methods for this kind of thing though: https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator-inclusion.html",
