        "content": "Have some modifications to EIP-8061 planned, firstly keeping the deposit cap so we can avoid having the conversation around this EIP be about issuance (and I think it's ok to wait a bit more to see whether the consolidation operation is adopted before deciding that the exit-and-redeposit path is the one that matters, especially if we accept EIP-8062 and plant the seed of being able to incentivize migration to 0x02). Another thing we are considering is to let exits use the consolidation queue (but not viceversa), to get more maximum exit throughput without changing the security guarantees further. Wondering if people have any thoughts about this, and more specifically about this possible way of doing it:\n\n```python\ndef compute_exit_epoch_and_update_churn(state: BeaconState, exit_balance: Gwei) -\u003e Epoch:\n    # Use the consolidation queue if currently shorter\n    if state.earliest_exit_epoch \u003e state.earliest_consolidation_epoch:\n        return compute_consolidation_epoch_and_update_churn(state: BeaconState, 2 * exit_balance // 3)\n   \n   # Today's logic from here (normally using the exit queue)\n   ...\n```\n\nBasically just routing exits through the consolidation queue when the latter is shorter (the 2/3 factor is because one unit of consolidation churn = 1.5 units of exit churn from a WS perspective). It's admittedly a bit weird from a spec perspective, but simple and quite powerful, as we increase the max exit throughput by 75%  (with the current EIP parameters, in particular exit churn = 2x consolidation churn) for ~free. Overall, we'd increase max exit throughput by *7.3x* while only reducing the WS period from 15.7 to 7 days",

        "content": "Another option would of course be to simplify the whole thing to have a single queue for exits and consolidations (always use `compute_exit_epoch_and_update_churn`, but with `3 * exit_balance // 2` when it is a consolidation, and completely remove `compute_consolidation_epoch_and_update_churn`). This is a bit weird because:\n- the WS period would be determined by the worst case, i.e. the whole queue using consolidations, so we'd have max exit churn = X but the churn relevant for the WS period would be 1.5X\n- no dedicated exit churn, so exits can get crowded by consolidations (which seems a lot worse than the contrary, because someone exiting might need the ETH back, versus someone consolidating is staying in the system and shouldn't have much of a reason to care when exactly the consolidation happens, as they are earning rewards throughout)",
