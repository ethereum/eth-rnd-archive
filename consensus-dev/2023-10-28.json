        "content": "this change would _greatly_ simplify the builder APIs and along w/ the gossip security improvements means this change is a strict improvement (and so should be included in the specs)\n\nhere's a rough sketch of what builder API changes we would need:\n\n```\ngetHeader:\nsigned_builder_bid:\n- header -\u003e header with blob commitments\n- drop blinded blobs bundle\n\nI think its fine for the relay to handle KZG inclusion proof computation, proposer doesn't need to also do it\n\ngetPayload:\n- only post SignedBlindedBeaconBlock\n- drop blinded sidecars\n\nRelay maybe shares KZG inclusion proof with proposer here, but doesn’t have to\n```\n\ni think we should discuss on the testing call monday and assuming there isn't any opposition i should be able to make the updates to the builder APIs later that day",

So in fact very similar to what is returned today, except that the blobs bundle is replace by a simple list of blob commitments?",
