        "content": "**will_vill**\nHey Chris! With Vitalik's new proposal, an async message will propagate by the next block. Many believe this is adequate for communication needs across shards (1 block latency) and async messaging is a natural way to think through it all anyways. Most programs operate with async assumptions and messaging across shards can be thought of as having similarities to messaging across threads in a program. Synchronous models can also be accomplished in a number of ways. IE - you can have optimistic rollups where multiple shards can be used as the data availability layer to also achieve sync/atomic communication (previous discussions referred to this as a delayed execution model). Additionally, you can create models similar to the following: https://notes.ethereum.org/YNnC-fakRxixbMCTEnNDXQ?view (these generally require coordinated relay effort and also fall in line with the sync model described in the serenity notes - hint: you don't need the additional functions on the beacon chain to accomplish this). In general, this is quite an open space and there are many suggested ways to accomplish \"sync\" communication across shards. The goal is likely that engineers will explore these further and the core protocol provides the tooling to build these models (in addition to just 1 block calls across shards in an async model).",
