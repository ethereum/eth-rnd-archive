        "content": "Hey all 👋\n\nHappy to share that I have been able to finalise the building of a \"State Transition Handbook\" for the Lambda Ethereum Consensus Client ( Let's call it LECC 😂 ). \n\nIn it you can find a guide on how to implement the State Transition function of the consensus layer of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nAnd what I am most proud of (cause it took a long time) though it was super interesting! \n\nA full tree representation of the State Transition function dependencies.\n\nWould love for you to give a look at the handbook and the visuals and if you have some feedback would love to hear 👂\n\n( You can take the svg and import it in Excalidraw.com ) \n\nHave a great week and let's keep building 🚀",

Did you create it by hand or generate it from the code/some database of calls?\n\nI did a similar call-graph analysis for `process_epoch` and dumped it into an sqlite DB.

I don't think you need any of the text/markdown for this sort of analysis.\n\nI went through function by function, recording the call graph in this CSV file: \u003chttps://github.com/sigp/verified-consensus/blob/main/call_db/function_calls.csv\u003e. I also made separate tables of the fields read and written by each function directly. The sqlite database takes this per-function data and allows you to run queries across the whole graph like \"which functions modify this field\", or \"which functions call this function\", etc",
