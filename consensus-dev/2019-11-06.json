There was a new hash-to-curve draft released a few days ago (v5: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-05) with some minor tweaks made. It is expected that this will be the final version.\n\nIETF meeting 106 (https://ietf.org/how/meetings/106/) happens 16-22 Nov which should be the last chance for people to raise issues with the spec before it is established as a blockchain standard. So hopefully fairly soon after that point (assuming no issues are raised).",

Will get this merged asap.\n\nJust saw that Nimbus has a couple of nets in the `eth2-testnets` repo -- https://github.com/eth2-clients/eth2-testnets/tree/master/nimbus\nI encourage other teams to share similar info as networks are spun up 🙂",
