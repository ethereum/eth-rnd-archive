We are mostly seeing large stakers withdraw 0x01 and then restake as 0x02. If we want to speed this up, we should increase the maximum churn rate in Glamsterdam. At least for the withdrawal queue, which would both speed up one leg of these large scale consolidations and also decrease the LST depeg arb which creates a feedback loop further increasing the withdrawal queue.",
