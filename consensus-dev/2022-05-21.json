If I'm a wealthy builder who can afford to outbid everyone at a loss and I'm trying to censor a transaction that has a max base fee of 150 gwei, couldn't I just fill up every block half-full to keep the basefee at exactly 151 gwei? That way it's impossible to include the 150 gwei tx in the unused space of my blocks, and my ongoing cost is `151 gwei × gas target` per slot, which is still huge but not exponential. Am I missing something",
