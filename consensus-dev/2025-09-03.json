It made sense when we were trying to slow validator growth, but now it is slowing consolidations and causing unnecessary LST depegs which is creating a vicious cycle where the depeg creates an arbitage opportunity that fuels more withdrawals and deposits and therefore a longer queue.",

One option is to fix the consolidation churn at 256E/epoch and make the entry and exit churn be \"free\" (remove the cap, make it linearly scale like before), essentially just being ok with having the consolidation churn degrade the weak subjectivity period somewhat (it's equivalent to adding 256E/epoch of both entries and exits, so a 50% churn increase when we are at 512)",
