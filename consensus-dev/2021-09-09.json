With the starting document being https://notes.ethereum.org/0pKTmPfQSTOGchVJEN785A?view#Stress-tests . Danny asked me what other tests I might want to run - and I'm really not the best person to answer that. If you can take 10-15 mins and think about what you, from a consensus client perspective, would want to see in a stress test, it'd be immensely helpful. Answers in a Discord thread or PM, whichever is best for you.",
