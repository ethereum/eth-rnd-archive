It's an interesting description of attacks but what it lacks is measure like what's the cost per hour to maintain an attack currently with rented hashrate for example? What is the impact on miners revenue if eth prices go down because of an attack? Without some hard numbers I just don't see how can it be justified the entire network paying. Adrian makes a good point that this by itself is a successful attack",
