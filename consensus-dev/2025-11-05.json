For example if pools are extracting value from this, the protocol could extract that value. Just want to see if there is, in fact that value.",

What would be the feeling of allowing the stake of those validators be infinite, but not participating in any validation. That stake is just sitting capital that is there. Execution proposers are chosen at random from that slice of \"builders\", no need for fees, no need for payments, no free option problem at all. Anyone that is willing to stake enough ETH gets a chance to propose. \n\nWe implement some circuit breaker mechanism if those validators aren't proposing (this is by definition a centralizing feature). This doesn't burn ETH as MEV-Burn would attempt, but this leads to large lockups so it benefits ETH the asset. It is technically very simple to implement, it removes any auction mechanics and communications between proposers and builders. It removes completely the free option problem. As long as there are more than a few differnet entities willing to stake there it should make multiple slot MEV more diffucult to attain. \n\ncc \u003c@269786774660710400\u003e you mentioned something like this to me a while back. What are the cons of this? Centralization of block building and multiple slot MEV are obvious ones. What others? I feel that a large FOCIL bwidth could help on the fiirst issue.",
