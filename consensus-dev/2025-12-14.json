Although it is an obvious benefit of the tech, particularly now that v2.3.8 requires 3/4 agreement among the nodes for an attestation to be signed by a validator.  That recent client update could be used to significantly harden the network against a majority client bug.  Maybe something for EthResearch to discuss with them.",

I believe there are many stakers who would consolidate to help decrease network load but want the liquidity of 0x01 validators.  If MaxEB provided choices like 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 \u0026 8192 ETH for 0x02 validators,  i believe there would be more net consolidation. \n\nThis is a more reasonable \u0026 practical solution than the reactionary EIP 8062 that penalizes non-whale 0x01 validators if they do not switch to 0x02 validators with a max 2048 ETH cap.",
