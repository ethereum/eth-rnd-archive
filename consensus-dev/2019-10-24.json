Another option would be to mock a network around the Go or Python gossipsub implementation. Modelling the time component; no hardcoded sleep or tickers. (Go has a mocknet, but it doesn't model time). That way the model doesn't have to run in realtime, and is not so heavy on actual network overhead (just model delays). And bounded by memory. Then plug in the strategy ideas for dropping poor messages, and aggregating new ones. Discussed lots of things and variations around devcon and Taipei conference. Also talked with the Handel folks (what got this all started), and just want to give pubsub based attestations a try.",

        "content": "Thanks for the suggested approach to formalize a cost model for gossipsub. The reason why Handel's cost function makes sense is that it is based on incoming aggregations, and a single aggregation is forwarded (as defined by the tree-like structure). The incoming/outgoing graph structure is deterministic. I envision that validators will perhaps desire the flexibility of adopting different cost models depending on factors like network congestion, known validator connections, or rack-level knowledge. Perhaps I'm mistaken, but wouldn't a challenge with applying cost functions to a gossipsub approach, such to 'aggregate subtrees of equivalent size', require knowing the entire network structure ahead of time and what aggregations the other validators have actually received? Which means that as aggregations are being processed across the network? So, still working to be deterministic, but with less formal guarantess than a known expected structure. It also assumes that the cost function is applied uniformly across the network. fyi I'm not arguing for Handel's approach, as I think Handel's approach would be one of the cost functions and determistic network structures which could work in conjunction with a gossipsub approach.",
