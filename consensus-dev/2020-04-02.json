On first glance it looks like we’re being asked to test the *specification* of the beacon chain and not any actual implementations, making it mostly a theoretical exercise. Though this exercise is valuable, the meatier and more deadly bugs will lie in the details of each implementation and not within the spec itself.",

See spec dev documentation linked in the readme.\n\nTLDR:\n- There's an eth2spec package on pypi\n- or git clone, make pyspec\n- There are tests, tooling, and you can interact with testnets through pyrum, rumor, remerkleable, and more libraries\n- from eth2spec.phase import spec\n- state = spec.BeaconState.deserialize(file, size)\n- More usage examples in the pyspec tests, and this repo (still on v0.10, but easy example): https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-py-hacks\n- Beware that the more tooling you introduce, the more likely you hit a usage problem / 3rd party problem first. But happy to answer questions\n- Happy hacking!",
