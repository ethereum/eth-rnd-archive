(with an assumption that more honest Block proposers than dis-honest one )\n\n**B) If He (Shard i block proposer)  lies about the slot N of Shard chain :** In this case if few committee members of shards will attest the Dishonest Block proposer Opinion then in this scenario, Other honest shard Proposers data will not help as the dishonest had lied about his shard chain.\n\nIn such case i.e. B , is there any criteria of including or accepting the data about shard blocks with certain minimum attestations?",

For a shard's crosslink to be included in the beacon chain, 2/3 of the relevant validators must vote for it (more precisely 2/3 of the stake). If this doesn't happen, a crosslink will not be created for that shard in that slot - this is the case \"failed beacon chain inclusion\".",

Even in case of \"failed beacon chain inclusion\". Shard Block is being included in the Shard Chain .. Correct?\n\n2) If The block with less than 2/3 or may be just few attestations are being included in the shard chain then will this not lead to inclusion of wrong shard data proposed by block proposer?\n\nThat what I was trying to explain in my question..\n\n- Wrong Block data is proposed Proposer (i.e. wrong data about previous shard block)\n- As the data is wrong in the Block so it will get very less or no attestations (if validators are honest)\n- If still the proposed Block is included in the shard chain then how to maintain the data validity in shard Chain\n\nI hope I am more clear this time..",

        "content": "Ah, Ok. I see. The failed beacon chain inclusion only applies if the block later gets enough votes - that is, if it just missed its slot but is otherwise good.\n\nI think that if the next proposer doesn't like the block, it will build on the previous block instead and the bad block will be orphaned. It's as if the block didn't exist. But I haven't studied this in detail yet, but it should be in here somewhere: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase1/shard-transition.md",
