This requires some assumption on honesty of the nodes that host the 10x storage devices that are willing to provide data availability.",

If a large staker (e.g., lido) joins the network, it may potentially keep only one copy of the data D while serving all validators of the staker of the shards?  This may hurt the actual replication factors of D.",
