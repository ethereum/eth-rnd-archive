We might cut an extremely minor `v0.8.3` (mainly aesthetic) a week from today as a final stable target for interop in Sept, but will discuss this on the call this Thursday.",

And then divide that by the length of an individual offset, and you get the count. Good question, but I am still hesitant in including a full blown deserialization spec, when it \"should\" (doubt) be clear from the serialization. Maybe a note on offsets could help.",
