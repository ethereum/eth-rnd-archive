    "content": "I think it's simple to reason about it as it is today and let clients deal with this implementation detail: we mostly use the lookahead when possible and fall back to process when not. So what I propose as a good compromise is to \n1) Leave the wording as process_slots, but\n2) Only test with examples that fall within the lookahead, \n\nThis way clients that want to only implement this on the lookahead side will pass spectests and not be blocked by releases, and at the same time clients that want to implement the full thing can. This adds a risk of a split view in the case when the head is older than one epoch and some clients apply a boost and others don't so it's a tradeoff, but I think it's better than adding a weird logic about it being in the lookahead of a state that is typically not specified.",
