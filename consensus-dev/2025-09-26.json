Say a malicious proposer submits two blocks with 2 blobs each, you receive `block_a.blob_1` and then you receive `block_b.blob_2`. Given the current checks, you would be forced to ignore the other blob from both blocks, thereby preventing you from accepting either block. There's a great description of the issue in Nimbus [here](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/blob/1ebb3ecc56d3947bb2b93e63fee6ebf1eb849fa1/beacon_chain/gossip_processing/gossip_validation.nim#L433-L483) too. What prevented other clients in pectra-devnet-6 from experiencing issues? req/resp?",
