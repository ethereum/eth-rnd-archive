If we move forward and client distributions dont change, we need to be more prepared for these types of correlated faults both as individual users and in aggregate when we watch the network. The type of data collection and analysis that \u003c@486501030046203915\u003e and others have performed is critical to diagnosing the health of the network\n\nIn general, I hope users experiment with other clients and have a backup plan. On mainnet, if you have issues with a client that cant be quickly resolved, I would be ready to jump to another client\n\nThe eip for validator interchange is up and has been implemented by most (all?) clients",

Rather, it's three fold:\n\n- Helps define scope of remaining tasks. \"Stabilize code\" can mean anything and a timeline informs the level we agree on.\n- Initiates discussions when things take longer than expected. If we are halfway to the deadline and we are far from halfway done with the required work, we need to talk about what is important and what is not. A feature or refactoring of something can easily go from must-have to nice-to-have if it turns out it take 4 or 5 times as long to complete as expected. We need to talk about these things.\n- Limit scope to what is actually important. It's far too easy to say \"Yeah, let's just start this new nice-to-have feature X, because the people over at Client XYZ will delay the launch anyway\", which turns into \"We can't launch now, because our feature X is not finished yet!\" - repeat ad nauseum.\n\nAnd finally, we need to stop thinking that delaying Eth2 is free. It has a real cost of dapps not being able to scale, community growing tired and leaving, and competitors peeling off valuable talent from the Ethereum ecosystem. We need all these things to keep momentum and the critical mass of talent that is the basis of Ethereums success! \n\nIf Ethereum 2 delays long enough to devolve into \"just another Smart Contract platform struggling to get critical mass\", we could easily see 3-4 years more of blockchain drought, with not much actual real-world value to show for it. Ensuring a successful launch of Eth2 is important, but this is what we are up against. And \"developers should not give deadlines\" is too cheap and easy an answer to lead us anywhere but on the road to failure.",
