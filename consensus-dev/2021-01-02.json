        "content": "\u003c@!273808422753796097\u003e apologies if this is not the right channel to ask. I have two questions about the \"incentive accounting reform\" {{2140}}. First one is `FLAG_HEAD_AND_VERY_TIMELY` as in the description of the PR doesn't exist right? (probably this was changed in some commit, didn't check). The other one is regarding `TIMELY_HEAD_FLAG` that gets set in \n```\nif is_matching_head and state.slot \u003c= data.slot + MIN_ATTESTATION_INCLUSION_DELAY:\n     participation_flags.append(TIMELY_HEAD_FLAG)\n```\nMy issue with this is that its another place where a validator gets rewarded purely by luck and not by doing its job fine. Mainnet has been going great, voting is essentially perfect. There are two aspects that this proposed flag rewards for: head and timing. \nFor head, currently essentially the only times we vote incorrectly now is when a block arrives late. This is fine to be penalized here, as there is no way of knowing if this is the validator's fault or the previous block proposer. This PR does not change behavior in this case. \nFor inclusion distance however, voting is so great in mainnet that essentially all the times that we get inclusion distance more than 1 is because the next block is missing. We get a penalty but this penalty is minimal. This PR changes this behavior to all or nothing and this seems to me that is penalizing a validator when it's clearly not its fault.",
