        "content": "Removing optimistic sync becomes possible when statelessness is in place, as you don't have to sync to verify a payload anymore. Before that there is no replacement for the optimistic sync except for the one you have mentioned. Attesting to a block without payload validation can become very dangerous. Is your assumption that as long as majority of validators are online they are winning the fork choice battle even if minority is attesting to invalid chain? If majority is turned into syncing and fed with invalid chain which eventually becomes finalized it will be a disaster",

The chances that a bug occurs because of the inherent complexity of optimistic sync seems to be actually higher. I am not basing these comments on hard numbers, just going with the fact that essentially all of the bugs that we are finding lately in our block processing logic have something to do with the interaction with the engine in regards to optimistic sync",
