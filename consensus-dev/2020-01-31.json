The specification text regarding log distance is \"the node IDs of all nodes in the response must have a shared prefix length of distance with the recipient's node ID\". I think this results in a discontinuous range. For example, a value of zero returns the recipient's record, which is at the opposite end of the range of maximal shared prefix (256); however, a distance of 1 would return those nodes that are furthest away from maximal overlap (only 1 bit would need to overlap in the prefix). \n2. Should the result actually return all nodes (up to a limit) that have _at least_ that many bits in their shared prefix, rather than exactly that many bits of shared prefix? If not, then it may spur multiple calls at each distance, increasing network load.",
