But even then Prysm + some minority client may have the same bug, so you may end up on the majority side with the minority client easily.\n2. There are so many possibilities of a split and consequences that there is simply not possible to say what is the best to do. You may try to do the right thing with a minority client but may easily end up on the majority side even with a minority client.\n3. The claim above that the majority client would be penalized more is only based on the assumption that the majority chain will be so broken that it will be dropped. There is a high chance that it will not be that broken so minority clients would not win in such case. Think what will happen when it's not clear if the finalized chain is broken enough to drop it, and what the influence has the billions worth of stakers behind this semi-broken finalized chain. Exiting times for sure.",
