There is a hypothesis that this change can increase dissemination time in attestation subnets because of lower mesh connectivity and lower quality of mesh nodes on average after the change takes into effect. cc \u003c@425567222635954178\u003e",

        "content": "Napkin math suggests that computational complexity of attestation subnet increases by 100ms on average if we jump from today's number of validators to 2M. Simply, ~350 vs ~1000 attestations per subnet, ~50ms vs ~150ms verification time because most of the time verified signatures are over the same set of data with exception to different beacon block roots. For strictly the same set of data it would be 0.1ms per sig with batch verification, i.e. 35ms vs 100ms. So, the increase should be negligible. cc \u003c@688748669268132001\u003e",

Could you also add 90 percentile as avg might not be that representative for block processing time",
