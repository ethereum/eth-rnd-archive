This graph shows the average delay in milliseconds receiving a block in a given slot-of-epoch for roughly the last 175 epochs.\n\nThis is pulling data from a couple of (Lighthouse) nodes and averaging it.  Because this is the time it is received by my listener, which is downstream from lighthouse (listening on the events API) the absolute numbers will in general be lower for the nodes themselves.  However, the delta is likely to be the same, and it shows that we are still waiting much longer for slot 0 blocks than any others.",
