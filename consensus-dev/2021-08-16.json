Briefly, with a load-balanced consensus client / beacon like Infura, with the default behavior of attesting early, \"you can easily get the event indicating a block is available from one server but then wind up actually creating the attestation from a server that doesn’t have it yet. So you wind up with the wrong head vote. That reduces your reward in itself but also makes it more likely your attestation won’t make it onto the chain at all since it doesn’t get included in aggregates etc. \". In our testing it cut rewards in roughly half over a 24-hour period.",
