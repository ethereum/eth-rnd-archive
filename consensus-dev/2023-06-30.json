I tried to read the docs and also asked on the general Ethereum Discord server but wasn't able to get a full answer. If there's any other/more suitable place where I could go to ask please let me know.\n\nI know there's only one block proposer per slot, but it can equivocate and also for other reasons validators can have different views of the chain so there can still be temporary forks. Leaving the finality gadget aside, my understanding is that there is still probabilistic finality via LMD-GHOST. How would I go about making use of that (assuming I can't wait for a justified or finalized block)? Can I just wait a number of blocks (how many?) as with PoW? Or to I need to do something more sophisticated? Also, are there any statistics about the temporary forks that have happened in PoS so far?",

        "content": "There's a \"confirmation rule\" which exposes the probabilistic guarantees from LMD-GHOST in the works here: \u003chttps://ethresear.ch/t/confirmation-rule-for-ethereum-pos/15454\u003e. It is not implemented in any clients yet, AFAIK. Presently the `safe` block is set to the justified block: \u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/fork_choice/safe-block.md\u003e\n\nThe vast majority of forks that have occured have been single-slot forks where the block at slot N + 2 competes with the block from N + 1 and both build on the parent from slot N. The incidence of these re-orgs has increased slightly since _late block re-orgs_ were enabled in Lighthouse and Prysm: \u003chttps://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/late-block-re-orgs.html\u003e. There's some tracking of forks here: \u003chttps://etherscan.io/blocks_forked\u003e, although I'm not sure how good that data is historically. There's also an overview of the amount of forking here: \u003chttps://app.metrika.co/ethereum/dashboard/consensus-performance?tr=2w\u003e.",
