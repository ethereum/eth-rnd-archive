After a snapshot sync, Teku does backfill all the way to Genesis, although we might change this at some point. However, we also begin peering and attesting immediately, without waiting for the backfill to make progress. So, there is a period during which we are unable to serve blocks within the WSP, and peers may disconnect us as a result. However, the usability gains are so good that we prefer not to wait, and it hasn't been an issue on the current networks.",
