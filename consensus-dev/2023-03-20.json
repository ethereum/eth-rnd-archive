As in allowing validators to be completely optimistic (but not allowing them to propose through an external builder). I understand there are some risks of validators being fed an invalid chain or a bug leading to many validators syncing at the same time compounds other bugs, but one of our biggest complexities lie in how we deal with optimistic sync and I can't help but feel that bugs arising from that complexity are more harmful",
