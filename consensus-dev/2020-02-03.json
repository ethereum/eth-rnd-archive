Is this query meant to return all blocks in slots [start_slot, start_slot + count * step) regardless of whether any slots are skipped?  Is this the right way to calculate the upper bound (start_slot + count * step)?  Would it not be more efficient to use \"count\" to represent the number of blocks to return rather than the upperbound for the slot?",
