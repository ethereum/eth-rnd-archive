This is based on some research on eth1 block propagation that showed that it is safe  (wrt propagation times and uncle rates) to have much larger blocks. This is the main thing that would change your resource per validator estimates in the new proposal as the bandwidth from shard blocks is higher",

A lot of this is highly dependent on your use case.\n\nGenerally, you sync the beacon chain and then sync whatever shard chains you want, or request data about specific portions of shards via the latest crosslinks in the beacon chain",
