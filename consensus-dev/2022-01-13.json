Might not be able to get them to switch all the way but at least gets the thinking of the importance of client diversity as a topic of discussion within their teams. While I am not a dev team member of StakeWise I am a vocal community member and could advocate this to the dev team for their consideration.  Forgive me if I’m speaking out of place here.",

Block production in DVs is a tricky question because you have MEV extraction on the table as an externality that can compromise stable DV operation.
