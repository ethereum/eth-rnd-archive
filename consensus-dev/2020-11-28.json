In short, I think an easy cheap check that a validator client can do is to grab the attestations  (from the beacon-node) from say the last 3 epochs and check if there is on-chain attestations from the validating keys it holds. If such on-chain information differs from the local slashing protection db then stop (or prompt the user or raise a flag or whatever). This should prevent double attestations on most situations and is a very simple and cheap check that you need to perform only at launch and only if your local db does not hold information from current/last epoch. Is there any argument against such check? The issue is at https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/7985",

I think that in general the whole slashing protection database is flawed, as the only mode of protection it offers is running the same validator on the same machine twice.  But in truth, the more likely scenario to be needing such protection, is having a ready to go standby computer, which you'll activate manually in case of a disaster in your normal rig.  In such cases, either the destruction (failed SSD) of the normal rig, or the inaccessibility to it (lost electricity), would render your ability to fetch a copy of the up to date slashing protection null.",
