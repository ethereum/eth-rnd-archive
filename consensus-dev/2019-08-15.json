E.g. packing 4 + 16 + 16 isn't going to work. But 4 + 16 would. So then field encoding is affected by other unrelated fields. And defining a nested container structure as a flattened one will not work anymore. And so do many more things. And containers are generally much smaller than vectors or lists, so it doesn't make much of a difference in hashing.",

It would require corresponding change in `process_randao`. We're using pure `epoch` to get other historical data e.g. `active_index_root`. And in the future we might want to get randao mix for the epoch in some other place and `get_randao_mix(epoch)` should work better then. However, it looks more like an aesthetic improvement.",
