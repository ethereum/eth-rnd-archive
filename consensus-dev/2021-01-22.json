        "content": "FWIW, when I proposed removing the ice age for Ethereum a while back it encountered a lot of resistance from the core devs.  I suspect that at the moment the ETH1 core devs aren't aware that you all removed that mechanic, and once they are made aware they'll request it be added.  If you strongly believe that it **should** be removed (whether that is now or at PoS), then my recommendation is to start prepping your argumentation material.  😄",
