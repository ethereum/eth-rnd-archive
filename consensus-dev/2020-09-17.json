        "content": "**Tim**\nHey all. Question based on being burned one too many times by wallet UX: Has there been any change on how nonce's are handled in ETH 2 vs. ETH 1? Specifically, will ETH 2 require sequential nonce's per account, just like in ETH 1? \nI had a much larger wall of text describing the pains this causes, though I think I'll spare that if there's already an answer. I also wouldn't be surprised if this has been researched ad nauseam.",
