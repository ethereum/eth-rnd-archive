The max size of the data is also a lot smaller as aggregate_bits max size is 64 times smaller, and we have to deserialize the data before we can validate the signature. I don't think it's as strong as a DoS vector as with single attestation. Major benefit is cleanup by having a succinct type for aggregate attestation.",
