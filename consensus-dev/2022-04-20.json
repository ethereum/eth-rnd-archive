I know of an `onBlock` function in prysm, but perhaps you are referring to the P2P specs:\n```\n[IGNORE] The block is not from a future slot (with a MAXIMUM_GOSSIP_CLOCK_DISPARITY allowance) -- i.e. validate that signed_beacon_block.message.slot \u003c= current_slot (a client MAY queue future blocks for processing at the appropriate slot).\n```\nWhich indeed says that we do not gossip blocks from the future, but we may keep them (and we do) to validate later on when its their time",
