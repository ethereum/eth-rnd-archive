I forked it so it builds on github pages (with github action), so it doesn't require the old nginx setup, and you can reference external dashboards in header + be clear about git fork info. You can fork https://github.com/protolambda/pyrmont.eth2.wtf for the latest styling/fixes, and a working config as example. I still need to merge those changes back into my open PR here: https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth2stats-dashboard/pull/1 There is a config file to define server endpoint, linked dashboards and fork info. And there is a CNAME file to configure the domain. You can also run it locally (use npm commands for hot-reloads etc.), and point it to a local server instead by using an environment var.\n- client: works as-is, hosted on https://github.com/Alethio/eth2stats-client (you can use upstream docker image)\n- server: collects clients metrics, and exposes a grpc (for client input) and http (for dashboard serving) endpoint. The websocket is available via upgrade on that same http ednpoint, but was always was a WIP, and doesn't actually do anything but connecting (not my idea). My fork has a branch with some experimental fixes and geo-ip update.",
