I've been testing with nodes in the same data center and between residential ISP nodes in the same city.\n\n**The question is would this data be usable/worthwhile if collected?** It would also be limited to where I could run the source nodes capturing the measurements, as it would only be reasonable to connect to peers within the same city.",
