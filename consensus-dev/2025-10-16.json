In teku I see that there are two subnet configs now:\n* `--p2p-subscribe-all-subnets-enabled`\n* `--p2p-subscribe-all-custody-subnets-enabled`\nDoes the first one only subscribe to all attestation/sync_committee subnets, without subscribing to all data column sidecar subnets? Is this how other clients have implemented this option? Does enabling the second one raise the node's custody setting to the maximum? Should there be an option to subscribe to all data column sidecar subnets without custodying them?",
