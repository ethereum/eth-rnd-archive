        "content": "The two use case I find worthwhile are the one you note, merged-at-genesis, and at least for the time being, Nimbus will continue to support never-merging networks.\n\nThe main aspect of that which I find useful is that it enables testing of and reasoning about the software in isolation, without dependencies on anything external. No concern about whether the EL is doing something strange, et cetera.\n\nIt's the merge itself, support for that event, not support for the steady states before/after, which is the source of most of the baggage, at least in Nimbus. Removing that has allowed it to become fairly sustainable (non-merged =\u003e vacuous case of \"EL responded with `VALID`\" internally, kind of like allowing it to just function fully optimistically in those cases).\n\nAnother way to do this is to have a fake EL client which just speaks the protocol and responds however one wants it to; a bit more realistic. Nimbus also has one of those: https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/blob/stable/research/fakeee.nim",
