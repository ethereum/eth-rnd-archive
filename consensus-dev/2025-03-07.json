I am asking this because i want to know if the lookahead of the next epoch would change if a validator gets slashed in the current epoch.\nEth2book says the lookahead doesnt get updated when a validator is slashed but i checked the spec and the compute_proposer_index method takes the effective balance into consideration which would change the lookahead if changed by slashing",
