And then using the beacon chain api. Basically calculate the balance before slashing - withdraws + deposits in the period. And subtract the actual balance at the end from this value. And that would give the penalty due to the slashings.\n\nSo Is there a way find the slot that the validator got slashed?\nLet me know if you guys think there could be a better way to do this",
