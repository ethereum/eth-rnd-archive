    "content": "Any analysis that needs to traverse the entire control flow graph of a program in linear time needs EIP-7979 (or EIP-615, EIP-2315, eWasm, EOF Functions, or the equivalent).  Whether that alone is enough depends on what the analysis does as it traverses.  But it's enough to enable many important things, including linear-time compilers and validators.  I'm also told that some intractable offline algorithms become tractable, but that's beyond my expertise.",
