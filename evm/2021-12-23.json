        "content": "Right, but that analysis in the thread was pre-verkle. Data privacy across contracts can be violated in both  trie models with a proper trie proof passed into a call, so extsload would make it much cheaper and more practical. The OO encapsulation construct is still useful, but other contact's storage should not be confused with a secure enclave.  My main objection to extsload is still the fragile developer experience.",
