Because then you can still retrieve ORIGIN 🤔 And I think also the other way around, legacy -\u003e EOF and there is a \"trusted contract\" which forwards the ORIGIN as calldata (you can check the sender, if it is the trusted contract then ORIGIN can still enter the EOF stack)",

Will be noted in EIP-7620's Rationale\n- EOF without the irregular state change for the Creator Contract - there will be a PR to Megaspec to demonstrate the alternative spec, discussion to continue next week\n- Dissallowing empty initcodes array or 0-byte initcode - accepted, will be applied\n- Ban ORIGIN - postponed\n- Validating initcode vs runtime containers based on how they're referenced and/or whether they have RETURNCONTRACT or not - rejected, seems like the merit (blocking unknown abuses) doesn't warrant the extra complexity to validation.
