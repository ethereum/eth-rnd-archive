From the same site, https://github.com/holiman/uint256#math-operations, first some non-mulmod operations for benchmark comparison:\n```\nBenchmarkMul/single/uint256-6             147034321                8.19 ns/op\nBenchmarkMulOverflow/single/uint256-6      45344761               25.4  ns/op\nBenchmarkSquare/single/uint256-6          196272379                6.14 ns/op\n```\nAnd here are the mulmod operations:\n```\nBenchmarkMulMod/small/uint256-6            26673195                42.3 ns/op\nBenchmarkMulMod/mod64/uint256-6            10133446               125   ns/op\nBenchmarkMulMod/mod128/uint256-6            4955551               229   ns/op\nBenchmarkMulMod/mod192/uint256-6            5210977               220   ns/op\nBenchmarkMulMod/mod256/uint256-6            5527972               220   ns/op\n```\nThese figures were committed in June 2020, so it's likely current hardware would be significantly faster.  Also, modular multiplication with some nicely structured constant moduli can be much faster than general mulmod with variable modulus, which may be relevant to the Merkle tree question.",
