This research project aims to propose a method of estimating gas costs of EVM/Ewasm OPCODEs (a subset of). In the Stage I Report we give a brief overview of the state of research on the topic, explain the motivation of conducting this research and present some early conclusions from the preliminary exploration. Next, we elaborate on the next steps to perform in the Stage II of this research project. We argue that measuring individual OPCODE execution duration is feasible and gives ample opportunity to analyze the differences in computational cost of different OPCODEs and different EVM/Ewasm implementations.",
