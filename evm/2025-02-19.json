        "content": "I think EOF needs `PAY` for security if it won't have `CALL`. The workaround is to `EXTCALL` the value into a legacy contract and `CALL` with `0` gas. But `PAY` is strictly better because there is only one value transfer.\n\nIt's useful security-wise to be able to block re-entry on an ether payment. This is one of the reasons that the callvalue stipend is not enough gas to SSTORE or call with value. While re-entry can be protected with `TLOAD`/`TSTORE`, simple ether payments are the main I still use less than `GAS` for the gas parameter of `CALL`. Especially with eip-7702 you do not want to grant control to the recipient just to pay them. They might even be an account unknown to you, as is the case for `COINBASE` payments.\n\n`PAY` is in the spirit of EOF because it doesn't have a gas parameter. It doesn't enable anything not already possible, because it is still possible to pay an account without its permission via `COINBASE` priority fees. It is not a complex opcode to add. Please consider it. Thank you.",

We can add it to the list of post-devnet-1 features (which includes post-osaka features) and haggle over the relative priority, but my view on devnet-1 priority is to finish all the breaking changes and create the minimum of what must be in place to ship.
