        "content": "The biggest re-evaluation that the BLS EIP needs is for the gas to be re-costed with up-to-date implementations.  My opinion is that the precompile should be costed so that repeated calls of the the keccak/sha3 operation is the most gas efficient way to \"waste time\" in the EVM, whenever using benchmarks to test. Costing at 35MGas/s (on a typical AWS instance with below-average compute) is an older standard.  I think 50MGas/s would be a safer option, although it would increase the gas cost of the precompiles.  Opinions lightly held if there is consensus for a different costing.",
