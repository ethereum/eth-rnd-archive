I assume that you'd only protect methods that do either an sstore or an mstore or a call? I would like to know if the gas costs are that prohibitively expensive then. A good way of showing this imo would be to show the total gas cost of some popular example transactions (interact with a dex, get sandwiched, wrap and unwrap eth, send a token, use a proxy, etc)",
