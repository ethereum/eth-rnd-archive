        "content": "I have some remarks about 5450. The EIP introduces rather strict rules on the EVM. There are some other rules which I do not consider to be necessary, but I am wondering if these are considered and if they are worth adding:\n\n- For each code section, is it possible to reach a terminating opcode (if this is not the case, all calls to this function will go OOG per definition)\n- Is it possible to actually call a code section (this is to **prevent** the creation of data sections which was the motivation of the original EIP). It is now possible to, for instance, create a final code section, but this one is not reachable via `CALLF` (this check is trivially done and linear in time, i.e. if section X can be reached by a call, and if section X has a possibilty to call section Y, then therefore Y is thus reachable) -\u003e so it is possible to create an unreachable final code section which one would use as data section (I know this does not make much sense, but I still want to raise this point 🙂 )",
