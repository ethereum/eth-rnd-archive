(Both are currently removed.)\n- EOF status update and potential champion expected early next week.\n- EEST will preserve the EOF testing work for future upgrade considerations.\n- Ipsilon team will consider to bring the team's paper on RICSV and EOF into the next ACD meeting’s agenda to increase visibility.\n\nThank you all for your contribution 🙏",
