A method that specifies a maximum number of items less than the amount required\n\u003e by a static analysis of the method (using a traditional control flow graph without analysis of the\n\u003e data) is invalid (hence also unverifiable) and need not be supported by a conforming\n\u003e implementation of the CLI.\n\u003e [Note: Maxstack is related to analysis of the program, not to the size of the stack at runtime. It\n\u003e does not specify the maximum size in bytes of a stack frame, but rather the number of items that\n\u003e shall be tracked by an analysis tool. end note]\n\u003e [Rationale: By analyzing the CIL stream for any method, it is easy to determine how many items\n\u003e will be pushed on the CIL Evaluation stack. However, specifying that maximum number ahead\n\u003e of time helps a CIL-to-native-code compiler (especially a simple one that does only a single pass\n\u003e through the CIL stream) in allocating internal data structures that model the stack and/or\n\u003e verification algorithm. end rationale]",
