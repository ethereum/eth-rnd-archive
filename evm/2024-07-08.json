        "content": "To be honest, the simplicity argument does not work for me. We now have two opcodes which do exactly the same as other opcodes (DUP1-DUP16 / SWAP1-SWAP16). It is super likely that compilers will use the original opcodes because it saves an deployment byte. We will thus see, in practice, that the DUPN1-16 and SWAPN1-16 are (almost) never deployed, which I think would be a waste of bytecode space 😅",

But since \u003c@403707149043105803\u003e explained to me one of the design goals of new eof is the ability to automatically upgrade code in place to a new version of eof if needed, I'm neutral on the issue.",
