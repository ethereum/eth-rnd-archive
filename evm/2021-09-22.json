Do we agree that it is a good thing and worth having?\n\nSimply put, I want to ensure that valid contracts will not halt with an exception unless they\n* run out of gas, or\n* overflow stack while making a recursive subroutine call.\n\nThe Yellow Paper defines five exceptional halting states.\n1. Insufficient gas\n2. More than 1024 stack items\n3. Insufficient stack items\n4. Invalid jump destination\n5. Invalid instruction\n\nSo  states 1 (out-of-gas) and many of 2 (recursive stack overflows) will halt at runtime, the rest can be caught at validation time, including stack overflows not due to recursion.",
