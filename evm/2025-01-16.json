        "content": "Thanks for the write up. I want to understand the interplay between EOF, 7702 and these use cases you mention. Is it that 7702's designation ~~revocability~~ mutability (enabling the front-running attack you mention) causes an EXTCODECOPY(target_address) be required before calling? There is no other pattern to protect against the front-running? (I tried to come up with one, but no idea so far). This seems like an argument against 7702 ~~revocability~~ mutability (admittedly, a can of worms) or an argument to revisit EOF's EXTCODECOPY (setting aside EXTCODETYPE for now).",
