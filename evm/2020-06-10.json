        "content": "I made a poc of an alternative 'shadow-array': using `leb4` instead of `leb64`: using 2 bits to encode the length (+ one 'continuation'-bit + one code-or-data bit). That means I can use nibbles instead of full bytes, and the size of the shadow-array is `1/2` the size of the code, reducing memory requirements quite a lot. \n\nThe encoding speed went down by 3-4x, but I\"m not sure that matters a whole lot, it's still quite fast.",
