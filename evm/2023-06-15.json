        "content": "hey folks \u003c@505624166175735818\u003e and I were talking about EOF, and we were trying to finalize a strategy for reading data contracts post the Cancun EOF merge. \n\nWe came up with the following, but were stuck, we were un sure if there was going to be an extdatacopy . \n\nStrategy 1 w/extdatacopy: \nWe create data contracts with the 20byte preamble and the 0xEF prefix as defined by the EIP-3540. We can then from other post cancun contracts read this data directly. \n\nStrategy 2  w/o extdatacopy:\nWe create a proxy contract prior to cancun, that can then read the data segment from a newer data contract, by ignoring the first data contract preamble. This would just be done wrapping extcodecopy in the proxy contract. \n\nSo has it been decided that there will or won't be an extdatacopy , and which strategy would be the proper one for post Cancun. My spidey sense says this will affect tokenbound accounts, as they rely on extcodecopy as well for their EIP-1167 minimal proxy implementation. https://github.com/tokenbound/contracts/blob/03a730c2c054d1880f4990b31e9c219660f913ff/src/lib/MinimalProxyStore.sol#L50. it's a web but if you follow how getContext get's called you'll see it , I think :).\n\n\u003c@403707149043105803\u003e \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e  and other what do you think ?",
