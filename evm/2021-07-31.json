        "content": "Please, stop counting amount of gas used. It is a virtual entity. It's _all_ made up. It only exists to account for the load on the node. An anti-spam measure basically. \n\nEither call uses up 10k or 100k or 1m - gas doesn't matter for the network, in the grand scheme of things. The only metric that really matters is block processing time. Gas is supposed to be a mere rough estimate, proxy of that.\n\nBut even here it's not really perfect. Right now we have an idiosyncrasy: SELFDESTRUCT is a *heavy* opcode, yet it has *negative* gas cost. WTF?\n\nIn practical terms, if we remove SELFDESTRUCT and other *clever fixes* from Ethereum spec, we can optimize and diversify the clients much more. This will lead to much higher block gas limits than we have today.\n\nWhat would be better for your wallet - 10% decrease of gas usage, or 2x higher gas limit? That's what I'm talking about.",
