If that is the case that this is included in the same hard fork as EIP-3540 that will be great.\n\n```\n- If the target account of EXTCODECOPY is an EOF contract, then it will copy 0 bytes.\n- If the target account of EXTCODEHASH is an EOF contract, then it will return 0x9dbf3648db8210552e9c4f75c6a1c3057c0ca432043bd648be15fe7be05646f5 (the hash of EF00, as if that would be the code).\n- If the target account of EXTCODESIZE is an EOF contract, then it will return 2.\n```\n\nThese are definitely really nice semantics to be able to rely on as all part of the same hardfork change 🙏 \u003ca:ToadFastVibe:888836264818790521\u003e",
