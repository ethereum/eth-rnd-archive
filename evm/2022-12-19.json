By the next AllCoreDevs (Jan 5, 2023), we want to have all clients with a complete EOF implementation and passing test suites. \n2. By the ACD after that (Jan 19, 2023), we want to have seen EL clients interop on a devnet. \n\nIf these bars aren't met, then EOF will be removed.\"\n--------\n\n.... Do we have a clear and objective measure as to what \"passing test suites\" really means?    How extensive must those tests be?  Those are only per-client tests?  Or should include ethereum/tests?  Shandong syncing status unimportant for that test?\n\nIf we are in a place where, for example, perhaps we have Geth, Erigon and Besu \"done\" and Nethermind not quite done, is that an \"abort mission\"?  That is a hard line, **all clients**?    (not picking on Nethermind specifically here, btw - could be any of clients being not quite there but very close)\n\nStatus:\nhttps://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/eof1-checklist\n\nMore general, what is the status on creation of a full EOF testnet?   Or we waiting on withdrawals to be complete and then just having a combined testnet?    What is the plan?  Thanks!",
