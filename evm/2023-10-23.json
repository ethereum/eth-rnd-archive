        "content": "\u003e  I would guess there are contracts where it is impossible to determine this statically (depending on the byte chosen for the new opcode).\nThere is a lot that could be done to track branch destinations flowing through the stack, memory and storage.  Its not clear how far that could be pushed.  But, there are situations which are definitely impossible.  For example, if a branch destination was returned from a `call` or provided as call data.\n\nBut, really, I'm looking for clear evidence this approach absolutely could not work.  The answer seems to be: *static analysis is probably not good enough to check all jump destinations*.  But isn't there anything stronger we can say?",
