In 1 you loose all 63/64 gas, in 2 only the initcode metering cost.\n\nI'm fine with them losing all that gas.  Solidity, Vyper, and other tools are not going to generate invalid code -- I think it would almost always be malicious. \n  \n\u003c@543900561460822016\u003e \n\u003e My only other thought on this is that it does place a constraint on how expensive we can make validation in the future.\n\nThis concerns me as well, but as Pawel points out the validation _has_ to be linear-time. Wasm requires a one-pass algorithm, and it seems unlikely that the EVM will be getting much more complicated than Wasm:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/#a3-validation-algorithm\n\nI'm not competent to judge the rest.",
