If you need the historical analysis, I would recommend turbo-geth because it is very quick to sync and uses much less space for an archive node. DM me if you want an invite to our Discord",

I'm happy to try OE + the methods you suggested. Just to clarify, when you say \"we\", you mean turbo-geth?",

It seems that the last submitted transaction was not displaying (it does when at least one next transaction id added). I was able to extract the addresses now. Thanks for you help! I'm still happy to test turbo-geth, especially if it works with web3py, as I have everything already set up for multiple types of contracts.",
