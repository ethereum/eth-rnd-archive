        "content": "Hey folks 👋 \n\nBeen reading stuff on seamless L2-to-L2 bridging - basically letting users move assets between any L2s instantly without going through mainnet or centralized bridges. \n\nQuick question: what would be the biggest pain point with current L2 bridging? Is it the long wait times, security concerns with bridges, high fees, or the complexity of different bridge interfaces? Trying to understand if native L2 interoperability is a critical stuff right now or if current bridges are \"good enough\" - would love your honest opinions\n\nThanks a lot",
