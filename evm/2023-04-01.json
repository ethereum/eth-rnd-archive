If it's storing deployed code then that is a non-starter since we aim to remove bytecode observability.  We could make generic deployment factories that _must_ be delegatecalled and would deploy their contract with suitable auxdata to address that.",

Note EOF has a built in 64KiB function limit, but can do up to 1024 functions within a container.  Data similarly has a 64KiB limit.  This is based on the two byte size value.",
