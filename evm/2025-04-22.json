So....\n\nIn the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5450 motivation you state that\n\n\u003e Single pass transpilation passes can be safely executed with the code validation and advanced stack/register handling can be applied with the stack height validations.\n\nBut I don’t see that the invariants given in the “Properties of validated code” section actually prove these.  It's also not clear what the single-pass algorithms are.\n\u003c@275684146658148352\u003e",
