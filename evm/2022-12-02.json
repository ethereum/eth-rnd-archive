Also worthy of note is that the entire EIP process is technically optional and non-binding.  Anybody can run whatever code they like on their machine (even something completely custom and non-public) and if that can stay in consensus with the others nodes then that is just fine.   If anybody can persuade others to join in a new consensus with them, that is also fine.\n\nFor one example - the recent EthereumPOW fork never had a formal specification, and the code was just a fork of Geth plus binaries just dropped on the world AFTER the fork point.  No history, no code available ahead of the fork.  No real coordination of any kind.  Just \"we forked, here is the code if you want to join us\".",
