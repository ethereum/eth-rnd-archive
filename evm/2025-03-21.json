I'm starting to become a strong fan of PAY, it is a hassle-free way of sending ether and also cheap because you also don't \"waste\" the 2300 gas on code if you are calling a code. The point for EOF forwarding all gas makes this even more prominent: then the \"simple\" challenge of paying people ether from a smart contract could become a big hassle and security concerns (although I stil believe that \"re-entrancy locks\" should not be necessary, contracts should be audited very good. But of course that still does not promise that there is no bug)\n\nI am truly surprised by the 1/3. Maybe one contract is sending a zillion of tiny eth transfers? Or small payments in uniswap or something which would somewhat explain this?",
