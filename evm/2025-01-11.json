        "content": "One complaint that is becoming louder about 7702 is the lack of code introspection. Right now it is possible to use CODECOPY or CODESIZE to get the executing code that has been delegated to, but EXTCODE* will only return the 7702 prefix. I think 7702 is more of a special case since the code can actually change- but I'm curious about the interplay with EOF. We'd obviously like users to be using EOF smart contract wallets when it is possible, but it seems that currently without code introspection, it will be difficult for a relayer to relay 7702 auth messages because there is no trustless mechanism in the EVM to prove the expected delegation happened. Would need to wait for the next block to make a proof into the state or tx trie. Any thoughts on improving this?",
