        "content": "relating to the mega-spec, I'd like to re-raise the option of a CALLX(+1 immediate) variant instead of overwriting CALL/DELEGATECALL/STATICCALL with new stack inputs.  The immediate would be flags (one flag for static, one for delegate, six for future use).  This would simplify the code run execution for Besu, or we would need to add in multiple registries for different \"EOF\" versions of the same VM.  The downside is we would have an unused \"value\" stack item for delegate and static variants.",
