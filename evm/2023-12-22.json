I'm definitely reading existing implementations as far as I can understand them currently, thanks for the direct link too!\n\nOne general question though: is this bytecode a valid EVM program `0x6007600901` it adds 0x7 and 0x9 leaving 0x10 on the top of the stack. I don't see why it wouldn't be a valid EVM program but when using say Solidity the minimum compilable-unit it wants is a `Contract` which has a lot more bytecode in it.",
