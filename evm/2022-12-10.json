        "content": "I've seen a question about https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6053.\n\nThe change is to synchronize EIP-3670 and EIP-5450 with the assumption the EIP-5450 is included in EOFv1. The requirement that a code section ends with a terminating instruction in 3670 is a quick-hack to allow more efficient EVM interpreter loop (no need to check if run out of code buffer). It also reflected solidity practice.\n\nThis requirement is to be removed from 3670 because 5450 gives very similar property. The practical difference is that in 5450 a code section must end with a terminating instruction or _an unconditional jump_.",
