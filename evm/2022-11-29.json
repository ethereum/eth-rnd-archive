I'm currrently in a Compilers undergraduate course and I am overall attempting to find a \"compilation architecture\" which best prevents decompilation attempts/debugging. I've read the yellow paper, and have been working with the Ghidra-evm framework for a few weeks, but thought it might not hurt to see if others have resources.",
