And it makes it look like implementing EOF would be far more difficult than it is, and with no motivation given to explain why we should make these changes.\n\nI have a lot more interest and background than most people, but it would take a lot more time than I have to understand this enough to review it, let alone implement it.  Devs with less motivation and background will, I strongly suspect, be right back to the reaction to EIP-615 years ago -- it looks too complicated and what is the point anyway?",
