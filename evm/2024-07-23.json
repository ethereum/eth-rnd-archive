It aims to be simple: conservative gas model, capping maximum modulus bit-width at 768 bits.\n* [The Case for an Aggressive Arithmetic Opcode Gas Pricing Model for EIP-7747](https://hackmd.io/QzHNML0YTYGy_djuAEl5Vg): This breaks down the performance and gas costs of BLS12381 G1/G2 mul implemented as EVM contracts using basic double-and-add algorithm.  Two additional cost presets are presented for addmodx/submodx/mulmodx at 321-384 bit widths (based on implementing mulmodx or all mulmodx/addmodx/submodx arithmetic with hand-written assembly). I show the effect these have on performance/cost, providing benchmarks of gnarks's implementation of double-and-add for comparison.  gnark is the backing implementation for 2537 in geth.\n\nThe point of the second doc is not to argue that EIP-2537 should be derailed, or to definitively answer what the most gas-efficient methods for implementing bls g1/g2 mul in the EVM with 7747 are.  I just want to present one data point to give an idea of roughly how far away 7747 could be from native  at 321-384 bit width.  For ecmul on bls12381 specifically, it seems like a lot of the optimizations that are used (e.g. glv, window) could apply with 7747.",
