One of the design goals for the Merge was to have as less changes as it's possible, introducing new opcode is definitely on top of that.\n\nThe more epochs of lookahead the more entropy the system will accumulate, the better quality randomness `PREVRANDAO` returns. It's based on a fact (written in the spec) that randao mix at the end of epoch `N` is the main source for seeding proposers in `N + 2`. Also, active validators affecting proposer's seeding and missed slots are taken into account (missed slots are very good source of entropy). I would recommend you to take a closer a look to this function https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#get_beacon_proposer_index\n\nBear in mind that whatever lookahead an app would use, `PREVRANDAO` return value will still be biasable in a way that we have discussed previously.",
