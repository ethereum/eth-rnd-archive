I now clobbered some go code together: https://github.com/holiman/go-ethereum/commits/subroutine_restrictions_analysis . Here you can see/validate the three filters I used: https://github.com/holiman/go-ethereum/blob/subroutine_restrictions_analysis/cmd/contractanalyzer/main.go . I wound up with 473 contracts in the end, available in the `filtered3.jsonl` file",
