If a compiler doesn't want this facility it can ignore it.  The block explorers will probably develop tools to introspect the metadata however it sees fit.",

        "content": "Yes runtime is quite straighforward `eth_getCode`. For initcode you need the creator tx hash, if not do a binary search over blocks (with `eth_getCode` if the contract is deployed at that block) and run through all tx on that block, and even then if the contract is created with a factory you need to look into the traces likely with an archive node. That's a problem we have in source-code verification and I find this to be a general centralizing force over source-code verification.",
