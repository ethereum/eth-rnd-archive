In a great twist of irony this is one feature that the road map has us removing in testnet-2.\n\nWhat are peoples opinions in moving TXCREATE from testnet-2 into testnet-1, and dropping EIP-7698 earlier?\nThat would move all breaking changes into the next testnet and make testnet-2 + into feature add only testnets.\nBasically the argument is why fix and test code that we already plan to delete?",
