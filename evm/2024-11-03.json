EIP-3541 (reserve EF contracts) would be a good example of one that couldn't be retroactive, because it was fairly easy to do and some people did in fact publish small contracts that caused some design issues.",

I just got a little excited this morning before I sat down and read everything properly 😅\n\nIt is definitely less than ideal for people who are consuming the specs for the purposes of building analysis or verification tooling. It’s quite difficult to define an accurate formal semantics if there are periods where the major clients, official spec, and test vectors are all in a state of disagreement (on an admittedly fairly minor detail).",
