I assume that the test generator runs (in this case the `evm` package) a package, and then dumps all storages/accounts and uses that to fill the files in the state tests / blockchain tests (the `post` field in the JSON). What if the package reports differently than the test filler? Does it raise an error?\n\n(If it is ran against `evm` then the geth implementation of the EIP most likely has a bug)",
