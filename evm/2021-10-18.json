One way we can format this data to better optimize bandwidth is to specify the split points by using non hex characters such as XX or SS or anything suitable\n\nThe final txn would look as such: 6687323ff2ff452df850112adb7b1b3728e6f608**XX**e28b775415f3c92ba\n\nWouldn't this help save on bandwidth ?",
