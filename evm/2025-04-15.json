The doc attempts to gather these in one spot and list their differences. We'll discuss this in depth on the [next EOF implementers call this Wednesday](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1429)",

And the feedback was I guess just that these features are missing in (3.) :). I'll make note of this, I hope this will be enough for readers to also grasp the feature-niceness split",
