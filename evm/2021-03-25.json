The problem arises with very short basic blocks that don't do very much computation and the \"superblock\" optimization doesn't work.  Even when it does work the slowdown can be circa 2X.  Paul Dworzanski says a bit about it here.\nhttps://medium.com/nearprotocol/wasm-for-blockchain-2019-d093bfeb6133",
