        "content": "One of the \"ban introspection\" alternatives was to allow [EXT]CODECOPY to only access data portions of the EOF.  Here's an alternate container format that would make that more efficient, and we could wire it into the constructor code issues as well and allow dangling data - https://hackmd.io/@shemnon/index_based_eof_container - although banning EXTCODECOPY into EOF I think is still viable.",
