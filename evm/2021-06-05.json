        "content": "Basically it would be an implementation of ERC20 with having access to all ether, so that instead of needing to wrap ether into something like weth, it could be used as a token. The obvious benefit is the simplicity and potential gas savings for the users.\n\nThis may be a precompile (which is entirely implemented using native client code) or a system contract (which would need some primitives exposed). I think the biggest blocker was whether how future proof this is (how long will ERC20s usability last), and the trade off did not seem to be worth it.",
