And without deployment-time validation we can't be rid of various runtime checks.  But I guess the VM still has to be able to run pre-EOF unvalidated code, so that might not be an issue.\n\nFor some of the others you mention, do you think we can find a way to handle them that doesn't require the ability to actually generate new code?",
