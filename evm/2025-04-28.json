        "content": "Hey all, this tweet https://x.com/thebensams/status/1916538962304512322 raises good points about gas introspection in EOF. Why did we want to remove gas introspection again? Gas repricing and zk proofs? The tweet shows some use cases which need control over gas sent with a call. If we ship EOF as-is, contracts will workaround this by using legacy \"gas splitter\" contracts, which we want to avoid to phase out legacy code (so this workaround will couple EOF with legacy contracts). There’s also a gas split proposal (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9558), this only allows forwarding a fraction of available gas. Where can I find the previous discussion/results?",
