I.e. to be able to run initcode and deployed code as they are already validated.",

For initcode the cost of validating it might be high but gets spread across all of the future calls of the contract code it creates.  I'm not sure what other ephemeral code you have in mind, but if runs just once the cost of validation might be too high to justify running it.",
