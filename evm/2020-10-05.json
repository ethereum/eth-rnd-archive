It's better than rpc when working with huge data, since it doesn't amass 5Gb of data in the pipeline before sending (or trying to) over rpc",

I'll also try to create a module for turbo-geth which could query directly what I need, as suggested by me through twitter. https://twitter.com/mandrigin/status/1312843393987379208?s=20\nA friend also suggested me to use this https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl, which also seems a good solution.",
