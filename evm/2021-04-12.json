I'm trying to compile the openzeppelin lib to ewasm and it outputs me:\n\n```\nError: Function \"setimmutable\" not found.\n```\n\nIt seems like this function is not implemented for the `ewasm` backend (i found related issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10148). \n\nI'm trying to compile the openzeppelin library to `ewasm`. I need your opinion: how you can estimate the overall state of the `ewasm` backend? Can it be used for anything practical today?",
