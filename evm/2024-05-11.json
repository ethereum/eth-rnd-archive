AFAIK it is only useful for specific use cases and is one of the biggest attack vectors otherwise. It might encourage devs to adapt EOF more quickly because it would be more secure by default.",

        "content": "I would argue not to do this, it is in the end the role of the contract creator to create a safe contract. The re-entrancy guard is, for me personally, a false sense of safety. The re-entrancy guard if necessary can now also be introduced much cheaper via TLOAD/TSTORE (I know the argument of this specific EIP is to make it even cheaper) so I would be opposed to this.",
