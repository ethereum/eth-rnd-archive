In Solidity when a function parameters has a type of u8 (or any size smaller than u256), it presumably will take more gas than a u256 because it has to do something to convert the u8 to u256? Or what is happening here and why is it more expensive and how does that translate to opcodes? I only mean in functions, I know that someone can pack a struct or order state variables by size to save gas but in a function it seems the behavior is different.\n\nWhat are the opcodes that are executed to adjust the u8 variable?",
