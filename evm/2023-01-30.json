        "content": "Is there any reason why at contract creation transactions there is no check to make sure deployed code is not null (0 bytes). It's a pretty annoying footgun. Just got my simple transfer on Arbitrum converted into contract creation by an Alchemy RPC because it removed the \"to\" property. \nLost some money on that since mobile UI is not very descriptive for contract deployments and i was just signing a 0 bytes transfer...\n\nWondering why that footgun case is being allowed by the EVM. It should just revert imo.",

Would have been nice if the focus was on stopping it from happening first, and only afterwards finding a solution for recovery. Since 2016 how many more cases of this happened when it was so much easier to not allow the creation of 0 byte contracts.",
