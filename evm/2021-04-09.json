        "content": "Hi all. I'm looking for a fast way to grab all the accounts (including external accounts and contracts) who's states was modified by a transaction. E.g.,  for a transaction invoking this contract's (https://gist.github.com/harnen/05f2fa58a3ffeb663acc5bd21d9b7182) `payAll()`, I'd like to extract caller's address, the contract address, but also all the paid accounts from the `users` mapping. The first 2 (and potential calls from other contracts), I can get from the transaction itself. However, for the last part it seems that the easiest way is to dive into the state trie. I was looking into `py-evm` API, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to do it. I'd like to perform the analysis for 1-2 years of Ethereum history, so need something reasonably fast.",
