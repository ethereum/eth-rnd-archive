        "content": "Thanks for the new spec!  I'll make my usual request that we get an actual Meta EIP soon.  The lack of one makes EOF seem more complicated, more difficult to implement (especially the validation)  and less useful than it is.  The result is more pushback on getting it into upgrade than I'd like to see.  I once hoped to see dynamic jumps die while I was still doing active development.  Now I want to see them die before I do 😦",
