Where the parallel comes from is the evaluation is parallel and uses optimistic concurrency control, where transactions are all evaluated in parallel and TXes that cannot be guaranteed correct in the out of order evaluation are then re-executed in order.",

        "content": "The problem most parallel systems have is that the order of evaluations influences outcome, and since blockchains have to be 100% deterministic then only parallel semantics that are deterministic can be used.  Right now this is just evaluation techniques like OCC, but there are other strategies that could be used (for example: delta writes) to permit larger blocks of \"unordered\" transactions.",
