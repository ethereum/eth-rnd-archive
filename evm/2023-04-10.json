Now this can be slightly re-worked to allow contracts themselves to voluntarily serve data they have.  Instead of deploying blobs you would deploy a small contract with a large amount of aux data, and that contract would respond to a function to ask for data at a particular data index and return it.  So data contracts must be self-contained.  We can even do this in legacy EVM, this does not require EOF.",
