Same semantics as before\n* We need to get feedback from Solidity and prolific gas golfers like SoLady WRT the flipped returns on EXT*CALL and user experience with low level `call` function and assembly blocks.\n* One last name change, EXTCALL, EXTDELEGAGECALL, and EXTSTATICCALL (which I'm estatic about)\n* To discuss next week, moving RETURNDATACOPY to zero padded instead of index failures.  There are no tests for this so it is a good time to change",
