From the abstract it doesn't look that promising:\n\n\u003e ... optimized for a specific benchmark program and a specific CPU... \n\n\u003e ... improved the execution speed... between 0.8% and 23.0% ...\n\n\u003e ... solutions do not generalize across different machines ... highly specific to a microarchitecture.\n\nIn the conclusion they propose \n\u003e ... to find a more general order across programs by optimizing for multiple programs.\nwhich it seems would likely reduce the typical execution speed improvement for any given program or machine.",
