        "content": "Can someone explain SIGNEXTEND to me? What does the item on stack position zero mean? I'd like to describe it as something as the \"integer byte length\" of the value (stack item as position 1). But if my byte length would be 0, then it is actually interpreted as a byte of length 1. (Is this correct?). It seems like a somewhat weird design choice to me, or is this a standard in the field? Sign extending a 0-length byte would just put 0 on the stack (?), so it does not make a lot of sense to include this in the semantics, but explaining this opcode is prone to \"off by one\" errors.",
