        "content": "Not sure if this is the correct channel, but I was wondering about the gas cost to send value with a call. Right now this cost is 9000 for any `CALL` with non-zero `value`. 2300 of this is for the stipend, leaving 6700 as the actual cost. I assume this is supposed to cover the two state reads and writes for the sender and recipient balances. Should this then not also be covered under the 2929 cold/warm state access costs? Seems to me 6700 is overcharging in general, but especially if either of the balances was already warm?",
