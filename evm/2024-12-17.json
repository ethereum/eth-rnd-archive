Using the nomenclature from Frangio's hackmd:\n\u003e I personally prefer Exact on all 3 EIP-663 instructions, departing from both SWAPn/DUPn instructions (which, as I proposed in the other comment, can possibly be removed from the assembly language). To me SWAPn/DUPn were always confusing and inconsistent, to the point I don't really treat the \"n\"s there seriously. If you look at them in conjunction with PUSHn (and, taking the argument to the extreme - CREATEn, MSTOREn, LOGn), n is something else every time. We should detach from this convention when we have the chance.\n\u003e \n\u003e I even prefer Verbatim over Traditional",
