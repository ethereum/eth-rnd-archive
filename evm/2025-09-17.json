        "content": "OK.  For EIP-7979 I'm going with PUSHn dest JUMP, since that is already how static jumps are expressed.  For EIP-8013 I had ignored the problem, which won't work.  But the thing I dislike about encodings is that they make EVM hex code difficult to read, or even to deal with by tools, and ad-hoc encodings make it worse..  So I'm inclined to use PUSHn arg OPCODE in all cases -- it's easy enough to optimize anf we can adjust the gas schedule to recognize the pattern.",

If we allow for adding these new opcodes only in appropriately numbered code then it seems we can allow for immediates without any breaking change sor special encodings.",
