        "content": "CALL and JUMP are not semantically equivalent and CALL is several times more expensive than JUMP.\n* Unlike JUMP, the contents of memory and the stack are not available to a CALLee.\n* The CALL opcode itself is more expensive than JUMP, which is  more expensive than JUMPSUB.\n* The costs of setting up a CALL are worse, so far as what has to be pushed on the stack besides the actual arguments.\n* Plus, the EVM already supports recursion.\n\nIt would be possible to detect and prohibit recursion during bytecode validation, which would  make it possible to detect stack overflow.  So that would be good, but it just pushes the problem from JUMP safety to CALL safety.",
