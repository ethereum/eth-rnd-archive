Compilers are going to use JUMPF for shared returning code, like common clean-up before RETF.\n3. They would ideally like to be able to do this without extra tradeoffs like extra code byte or callf-stack limit. If the cost of extracting common code to a helper is non-zero, it might be not worth it, or hard to implement in compiler.\n4. Potentially compilers might use ut for tail-call optimizations.\n5. Non-returning flag allows validation to detect non-reachable code afer CALLF/JUMPF to non-returning function, otherwise it's considered reachable.",
