        "content": "An idea: instead of a fixed-size stack, make stack growth like memory, \"practically unlimited\" but quadratically expensive.  This is a simplification of the spec in that it removes one exceptional halting state.  The PUSH gas cost does get more complex, but all stack overflow checking goes away.  The various subroutine proposals can eliminate runtime checks for underflow and invalid instructions, leaving only OOG.",
