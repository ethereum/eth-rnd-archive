Repository :  https://github.com/engram-network/tokio-docker\n\ni created a script to deposit to the testnet network using the tool from parithosh. https://parithosh.com/2021/06/09/2021-09-06-eth2-deposits/ and it successfully deposited 32 tokens to the network https://scan.engram.tech/tx/0x8f9c3db2bd91c1689ac89d15abc94f695686c376ab84d7960f46b4b91c739e5f. \n\nafter i finished the deposit how do i run the validator node using lighthouse? i see lighthouse uses staking-deposit-cli to create the deposit data and import it. while i only have the script from parithosh. i also changed the staking-deposit-cli there but it failed. Notif Validator node \"Awaiting Activation\" and waiting 2 days. do you know how if someone wants to join the network and become a validator and deposit tokens? thankyou sir",
