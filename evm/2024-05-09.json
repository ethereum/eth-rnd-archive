You can see the list of individual EIPs in the [EOFv1 Meta EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7692).\n\nThere are two changes we have in the pipeline, addressing recent feedback:\n- [removal of `TXCREATE` opcode, the `InitcodeTransaction` type and the special creator contract](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8522). The [Megaspec](https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/blob/main/spec/eof.md) already has these changes applied.\n- [a tweak to the EOF validation of creation opcodes](https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/pull/86)",
