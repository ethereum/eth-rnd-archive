For CALLF and JUMPF check for possible stack overflow: if stack_height_max \u003e 1024 - types[target_section_index].max_stack_height + types[target_section_index].inputs, validation fails.\n\nmoreover the actual stack height at runtime will be larger than stack_height_max so this static check seems like it's not doing anything significant. would you consider removing it?",
