You're probably counting `codecopy`, but worth a mention (I forgot it initally, luckily tests caught it)!\nIf the data also showed which bytecode indices were touched, we could try various chunking/merklization algos locally without needing to scan the blocks. But that'll probably grow the dataset size and complexity so not sure if its worth it",
