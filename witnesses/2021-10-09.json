If not, would appreciate pointers on the current status and what's needed to get to this state.\n\nA canonical example of what I'm trying to accomplish is to implement `eth_call` on light clients. From my understanding of the witness mechanism, this should be possible to do - I have state merkle root, the tx supplies the state, I verify the witness and then simulate the call. Is this possible to do today by gluing some witness related libraries together?",
