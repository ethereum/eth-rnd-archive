        "content": "I have a couple of questions regarding witness size reduction strategies: 1) is there general agreement now on which strategies 'must'/'strongly advised' to be used to reduce witness sizes? In the past there has been mention of point proofs and polynomial commitments, but lately I have only heard mention of binary tries and code merkleization to reduce witness sizes. 2) will all witnesses be created using both methods to reduce size, or is it possible that a witness may be created without the code merkleized?  If so, do we expect this to be a rare or reasonably common occurrence?",

        "content": "Someone jump in to correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there is no 'must' for any of this stuff. We know that witnesses without code merkleization for a hexary trie are probably far too large to be workable, and after the last call it seems like binary trie + code merklezation are two things that are at least in principle possible to start on as an EIP. One of the things that's often glossed over is that any proposed changes will have to be enacted through the EIP process, and moving quickly through that process is the motivation for keeping things simple and straightforward; the further through that process a change gets the more scrutiny it will receive, so it's a balancing act of making changes that are ambitious enough to have a meaningful impact but simple enough to be widely understood, tested, and accepted by all core devs and the wider community",
