        "content": "An update.\n\nThanks to \u003c@!520564582196969472\u003e I for making major improvements to the spec document.\n\nA proposal: Our witness spec should define a semantics rule alongside each syntax rule. This is called syntax-directed translation over an attribute grammar.\n\nThe reference is Aho et. al., Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, 2nd, chapters 2, 4, and 5. Note that this is considered the standard textbook and is used in many courses, which is great because using methods from this textbook will be less controversial.\n\nI am particularly interested in how this textbook has methods to show that a syntax is unambiguous, which is exactly what we need!\n\nToday I will start writing the syntax and semantics rules, while iterating with the textbook. I will give another update mid-week.",
