So it's my understanding that atm intermediary tries like the txtrie or the reciepttrie are only temporary (since we are able to reconstruct them from data available in the block), but has there been any thought about maybe having an option to cache them for x blocks and exposing that for proof retrieval? It would make certain applications easier (like relaying between eth chains!) without having to redo work that is already being done (by having to batch query for everything and just remake the whole trie to retrieve a single proof)",
