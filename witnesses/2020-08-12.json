My current use case is somewhere between a full node (expensive) and a light node (extra latency for state RPC queries) which seems to fit the witness mechanisms perfectly.\n\nIs it possible to use the witness mechanisms today in a private mainnet network (all nodes on mainnet, normal full nodes at the edge to generate witnesses and propagate to inner nodes)?",
