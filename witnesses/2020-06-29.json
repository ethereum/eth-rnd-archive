Code deduplication\n - complicates canonicalness checks (what is canonical code deduplication?),\n - increases witness building cost, which grows as you have more code to check for deduplication,\n - is not free (there is overhead to encode that there is duplication),\n - may not have significant savings, especially if there is regenesis.",
