        "content": "Hi, all. Recently I did a experimental implementation of the witness spec in hyperledger besu so it generates a witness upon processing a block. It seems straightforward for a full-state miner to generate the witness. I'm just wondering how would it look like for a transaction sender to attach the witness? What does the state trie look like on the transaction sender side and on the miner side? Thanks. 🙂",
