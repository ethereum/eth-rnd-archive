My current use case is somewhere between a full node (expensive) and a light node (extra latency for state RPC queries) which seems to fit the witness mechanisms perfectly.\n\u003e \n\u003e Is it possible to use the witness mechanisms today in a private mainnet network (all nodes on mainnet, normal full nodes at the edge to generate witnesses and propagate to inner nodes)?\n\u003c@!283445391721234432\u003e Our witnesses are not production ready, and they are fundamentally a different thing, the thing we are working on first is more like a state object snapshot. What are you trying to do exactly?",
