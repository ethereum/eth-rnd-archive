My goal is for the witness format to have both of these properties.\n\nI started rewriting \u003c@!520564582196969472\u003e's witness spec, deviating slightly, nothing major. The focus is no ambiguity and efficient parsing.\n\nThe most awkward part so far is enforcing that trees don't over-shoot the depth limit. I write these restrictions in plain English for now, because I don't want to introduce new notation.\n\nFor those who are both impatient and don't mind reading a work-in-progress, [here is a sneak preview of the witness spec rewrite](https://notes.ethereum.org/dfeV_C-pSI2h378AadR9DQ?view). I am happy with it so far, it is concise but dense. Not ready for pull request yet, and hackmd is easier for me to iterate on.\n\nI need a break from reading Aho's textbook, so I will focus on the parser/generator implementation, and on the random witness generation tool.\n\nI will give an update at the end of the week.",
