    "content": "Nice! By the way, one complication with compression is that most zstd libraries do not support `no_std` and as such can not be operated in zkVMs. This is problematic if we want to charge for the transaction based on its compressed size rather than its raw size. Additionally, many compression algorithms are not deterministic, so you will have different outputs for the same input. There are solutions for both of these issues, but I just wanted to share that context so that we can consider it in protocol design.",
