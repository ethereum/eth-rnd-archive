I'm not 100% sure this is the right channel for this, so feel free to lmk if not...\n\nI think interoperability is critical for trustlessness to be able to exist in the metaverse - If a functional NFT *isnt* interoperable, then surely you have to trust the platform issuing the NFT to actually give it life and therefore value?\n\nFor that reason, I'd love to be able to generalise NFT avatar and 3D model support, and for other metaverse platforms to follow. \n\nAre there any erc721 metadata standards for avatars, or 3D models of any kind?\n\nIf not, would anyone be interested in looking into it with me and trying to set one up? Does anyone else have any experience in this area?",

I think that's a great avenue to explore, and would actually bring a lot of value to the space.\n\nUnfortunately, this channel is specifically for specifying the Ethereum protocol itself, and not for contracts or tokens (like NFTs) built on top of it.\n\nYou should absolutely continue this research path and hopefully end up with an EIP! That said, I, personally, don't know the best place to start such a discussion... Maybe ask in \u003c#595721451651465227\u003e ?",
