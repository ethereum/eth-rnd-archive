At some point people started calling contract standards ERCs, but they were still part of the EIP process and given an EIP number.  People just called them \"ERC-712\" instead of \"EIP-712\" even those meant the same thing.  More recently, the EIP and ERC repositories were split I believe, so now there are actually two separate processes, but 712 came before that.",
