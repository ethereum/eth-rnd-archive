I can't see the redefinition of [`slash_validator`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#modified-slash_validator) make a distinction between big/small validator. It's all just two lines:\n```\n    slashing_penalty = validator.effective_balance // MIN_SLASHING_PENALTY_QUOTIENT_ELECTRA\n    decrease_balance(state, slashed_index, slashing_penalty)\n```\nAnd this math changes from 32/32 (=1) to 32/4096 (=0.0078125). \n\nWhile EIP-7251 argues lowering the min slash penalty quotient is an incentive to switch to a large validator, I can't see at all how this translates to the actual Python in the consensus-spec. I would argue that it is actually a disincentive to consolidate.\n\nAm I missing something?",
