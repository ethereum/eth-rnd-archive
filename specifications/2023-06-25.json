        "content": "Hello ! \n\nI'm currently writing an eth 2.0 \"simulator\" for my Ph.D for incentives analysis and there is something I'm not understanding from the specs.\n\n1. In the event of a fork, does each branch apply penalties to validators voting for any other branch ?\n\nSince a block must contain only valid attestations to be valid, it means that on a branch `A` we only have the attestations for that branch hence all validators who voted for branch `B` are considered to have missed their attestation right ? \n\nBut we must also ensure that we don't receive conflicting attestations, so we should track other branches too to detect any slashable offence which implies that the attestations are more on a per epoch / per slot basis ( potentially covering mustiple branches ) no ?\n\n2. Could you explain me how you handle conflicting checkpoints ? \n\nLet's assume that there is a fork and that we are at slot 32 for simplicity.\n\nOne branch could create a new block at slot 32 , extending the last known block at slot 31. This block at slot 32 is a checkpoint for this branch.\n\nThe other branch could be created at slot 33, creating a new block also linked to the block at slot 31, hence the checkpoint of the epoch for this branch is the last block of the previous epoch ? \n\nIn this situation, for the same epoch and different branches we have different checkpoints that are not in sync, is that an issue ?\n\nThank you very much in advance for any answer / information that could help me ! and sorry for the long message :p",
