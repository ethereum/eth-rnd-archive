Most have both (are there any pre-spurious dragon conracts with non-1 nonces?). Since code cannot be deleted post EIP-6780 it cannot become empty.\n* EOAs may have a balance and zero nonce.  To zero that balance they would need to send a transaction.  EIP-3074 may break this, as an EOA can sign a message authorizing a transfer.  3074 can fix this by having AUTHs increment the nonce.",
