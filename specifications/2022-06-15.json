I am currently on Apple M1 which does not play very well with PyPy at all.\nTbh, since I do most of my development on CPython anyway, I decided not to pursue the PyPy setup beyond the most trivial attempts.\n\nFor now, I just rely on CI to show me if there are any issues with pypy3 (which has never been the case thus far). Will probably get back to setting up pypy at a later point",
