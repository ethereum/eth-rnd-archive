It would add complexity to the state management aspect of things but if you really want to be able to validate all the way to the front of the chain in a reasonable amount of time....  I think you guys are gonna end up needing to be able to execute blocks in parallel, otherwise your sync times as the gas limits get higher and the total state size gets larger are going to grow and grow and grow....",
