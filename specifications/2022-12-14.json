        "content": "Looking at `BLSToExecutionChange` and wondering the following:\n\n1. I am assuming the fork info used to build the `Domain`  must now contain `version=0x03000000`, but what about `validators_root`? Will that need to be changed to the actual root at the fork epoch, at which point the spec document will be updated?\n2. I'm assuming the output of this operation is the `hash_tree_root` of `SignedBLSToExecutionChange`  -- is that correct? Is there a good resource to figure out what data actually needs to get broadcast to the CL node in order for this operation to be processed by the network?",
