They can be included because they match the _source_, which is the current justified checkpoint. Once one side updates its justified checkpoint (with 2/3 of votes), then the attestations won't be able to be included.\n\nThat's what the `assert is_matching_source` in `get_attestation_participation_flag_indices` accomplishes. Until justification, the validators on both sides will still be receiving the `source` reward for matching `source`, but will be missing rewards for `target` and `head`.\n\nThere aren't really any other problems with validating the attestations, the beacon node can track multiple chains and will verify attestations against the chain that they claim to come from. In your single-slot fork example, one chain will probably receive more votes and the `target` checkpoint referring to _either_ slot 31's block or slot 32's block will become canonical, then justified, then finalized",
