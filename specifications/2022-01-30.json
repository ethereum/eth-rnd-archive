The remaining ones will be implemented by Peter. \nCurrently, 3309 state tests are passing  and 1434 are failing. I think that the majority of test failures are because of the missing implementations. \n\u003c@!830368514225340436\u003e If you're interested then you could help me fix some of these tests. I'll be happy to add you as a co-author to any commit that you fix the tests for. If you're interested then  please ping me with the test file names on the PR thread that you decide to fix the tests for. I'll be fixing these when I get the time, so I want to make sure that the work is not duplicated. \nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/443\ncc \u003c@!243183686562873344\u003e I have opened the PR early so that you can start working on the rest of the EIPs.",
