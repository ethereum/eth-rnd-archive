EF issues an “official” deprecation notice for the YP on public channels and adds a similar notice to the current repos/hosted documents and points to `execution-specs` instead. \n\nwdyt?",

That would be my preferred option (see: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/core-eips-in-an-executable-spec-world/8640) but I don't think we quite have the consensus to move forward here (and EELS still needs a bit of polish AIUI). That said, I'm happy to bring this up on calls once the python spec is finalized and we feel like it's the right time to move forward.",
