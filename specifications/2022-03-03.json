But it seems like Chain ID is not a hard requirement. \nI just executed a TX without Chain ID on goerli and then replayed it on kovan. \nThe spec says so too: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/1ed7b5d9bc43223637e4f4796180d67b44d82c48/src/ethereum/spurious_dragon/spec.py#L631-L639\nAny idea why Chain ID hasn't been made a hard requirement?",
