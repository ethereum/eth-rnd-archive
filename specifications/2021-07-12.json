Your numbers look correct to me. Agreed that we should at least increase `TARGET_AGGREGATORS_PER_SYNC_SUBCOMMITTEE` to `8`, or even more. /cc \u003c@291925846556540928\u003e",

        "content": "Thanks.  You may want to add one more column, which is the chance of having aggregators for all subcommittees in a day (so L=K^225).  Because the difference between 8 and 16 target aggregators per sync subcommittee seems small on a per-epoch basis it makes 8 look reasonable, but when you expand it up to a day you can see the difference much more clearly (8 gives basically no chance, 16 gives a very high chance).",
