I'm currently looking at constructing the deposit `Domain`.\n\nIt looks like the  the official staking deposit CLI has hardcoded `genesis_validators_root` here: https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/blob/e2a7c942408f7fc446b889097f176238e4a10a76/staking_deposit/utils/ssz.py#L49\n\nand it also uses the genesis fork version by default: https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/blob/76ed78224fdfe3daca788d12442b3d1a37978296/staking_deposit/settings.py#L21\n\nI'm wondering... are these values expected to change after future forks? Or will generating deposit data based on genesis always be valid?",
