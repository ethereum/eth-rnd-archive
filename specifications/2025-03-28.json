Given that everything is still linear, I don't see how the EIP achieves its goal. Just my .02$. I just discovered that there is a lengthy discussion on ethresear.ch. I'll look there.",

[`get_attestation_component_deltas`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#helpers) has:\n```\n    for index in get_eligible_validator_indices(state):\n        if index in unslashed_attesting_indices:\n            # ....\n        else:\n            penalties[index] += get_base_reward(state, index)\n```\nSo slashed validators just get a penalty no matter what they do, right? Even if they vote correctly, they get the penalty applied. How much that is cummulatively depends on how full the exit queue is. Isn't that a bit random? We already have correlation penalties implemented in `process_slashings`.",
