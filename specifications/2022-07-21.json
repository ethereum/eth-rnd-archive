We have a process for reviewing them and getting them to a good Final form, but the core devs can (and do) pull them into upgrades before that, at which point the are Final, like it or not.  There should be Errata when they are found not to describe the real mainnet, but that part of the process has never much happened.    The canonical written specification remains the Yellow Paper, but it runs way behind due to inadequate resources.  Anything that behaves differently than the mainnet is wrong regardless.",
