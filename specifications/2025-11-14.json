Please take this an example from someone who is not a core dev but is trying to follow and understand all the proposed technical changes. So I was reading PeerDAS (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594) a few times and also started testing on Sepolia. It was _not_ clear to me that presigned \"OG\" EIP-4844 transactions will not propagate on the network layer after Osaka. After talking to a few people and also reading (https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/10/15/fusaka-blob-update) things became more clear. But the EIP is missing this important fact. Sure, you can do a conversion, but please point this out in the EIP. The original reason why I found out about this is that I have a simple script that raw-signs an EIP-4844 tx and broadcasts it on Sepolia. From the \"unexpected eip-4844 sidecar after osaka\" error I was very confused first.",
