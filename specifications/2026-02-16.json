This lead me to task Claude with a full review of the beacon-API spec for inconsistency and underspecifications. I am a bit surprised by how comprehensive the result is (and that it burned north of 200k tokens for this work).\n\nHere is the full report: [Ethereum Beacon API: Ambiguities and Underspecified Behavior](https://github.com/catwith1hat/beacon-APIs/blob/spec-check/IMPROVEMENTS.md#ethereum-beacon-api-ambiguities-and-underspecified-behavior). <@654267572107083777> saw a preliminary version of it yesterday and rightfully remarked that this is a low signal to noise document, so I added a [top-20 risks for interop section](https://github.com/catwith1hat/beacon-APIs/blob/spec-check/IMPROVEMENTS.md#top-20-interoperability-risks) at the bottom of the document. Each top-20 has an argument why this is an interop risk, and reading through a couple, I have the impression that this is a useful list overall.",
