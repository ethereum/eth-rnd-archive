If `TARGET_AGGREGATORS_PER_SYNC_SUBCOMMITTEE` were increased to 16 that would pretty much solve the problem, but obviously then we're at a 1 in 8 chance of a sync committee member being an aggregator so a fair bit more overhead.\n\nI would have preferred it if aggregators weren't rotated quite as quickly as every slot, but still think that the overhead of increasing `TARGET_AGGREGATORS_PER_SUNC_SUBCOMMITTEE` to 16 is going to be worthwhile in terms of the level of surety that sync committee messages will be included on the chain (or at least have a fighting chance of doing so).\n\n\u003c@!291925846556540928\u003e thoughts on this?",
