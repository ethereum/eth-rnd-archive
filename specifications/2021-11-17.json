I'm still finishing a project on the fee market and the flashbots folks have suggested some further work which seems like a natural continuation. I think spec work will take me a while to get up to speed. Things also a bit hectic in personal life right now so I don't want to commit to anything I can't deliver. Sorry, should have said before and hope that I can contribute at some point in future!",
