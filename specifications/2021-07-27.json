It was aliased as `SELFDESTRUCT` in `EIP-6` and that can be seen in all versions of the YP starting from `Homestead`. \nQuestion: Do we want to rename it to `SELFDESTRUCT` in the `Frontier` version itself `OR` do we want to preserve the history by naming it `SUICIDE` in the `Frontier` version and then rename in the later forks?",
