I understand that this is rather controversial topic in history (see https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/removing-or-increasing-the-contract-size-limit/3045) but I feel the demand is much stronger than 3 years ago, and the technical side is ready (as we have implemented one and run on our Ethereum-sidechain testnet).  Happy to receive comments and suggestions!  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5027/files",
