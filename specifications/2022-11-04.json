Unfortunately, there are probably quite a few implementation-defined characteristics and I think it would take a while to document them all and then we'd need to always keep them in sync with the code. So I tried to do something in the middle ground. It would be great if as you implement it you could keep a list of things you run into that we can either i) change about the tools or ii) should be better specified.\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26111",
