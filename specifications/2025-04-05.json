I haven't been able to spot anything, but e.g. a `GET eth/v1/validator/attestation_data?slot=${WANTED_SLOT}` could be made to wait until attestation_data is available for the wanted slot. I would think that this would make some sense, but I don't think that's how any part of the spec works, right?",
