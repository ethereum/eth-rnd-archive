I am a functional programmer and language designer developing specification languages to represent laws and (non-smart) contracts, now considering transpilation to Solidity through refinement & extraction methods. I know there has been some work done in formal verification for crypto and look forward to learning more. One approach we are considering is to reduce the amount of rope that developers seem to be currently using to hang themselves, by creating a higher-level DSL that restricts expressivity to what is both idiomatic and verifiable.
