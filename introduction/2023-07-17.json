The Discord invite I received via email is invalid, I found this link from a Kagi search; am I in the right place for the Protocol Fellowship? I assume there is a channel I need to be invited to.\n\nRegardless of that: hello and nice to meet everyone! My name is Jordan. My goal during the programme is to try and improve the developer experience surrounding Ethereum!\n\nEDIT: Found the channel: <#843176491386667018> !",
