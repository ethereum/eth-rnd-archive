I'm Finn, I have a year's experience being a Full-Stack Dev (NextJs/Wagmi/Foundry), but just took a year to finish my masters in Computational Finance (my undergrad is in Economics). I'm a young guy (23), and cant really bring myself to work in the cutlure of TradFi - I'm looking for professional internships/positions if any are available. I'm on this server to learn Geth/Reth inside out, and figure out the low level architecture of ETH, in a hope that I can find a way to contribute.",
