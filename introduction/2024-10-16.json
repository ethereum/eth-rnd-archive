I really enjoyed your post on X about the L1/L2 chain relationship (https://x.com/0xalizk/status/1846188021126709336) and wanted to ask some questions about your view on it. Seems like you limit who can reply, how do you prefer I engage?\n\nBest regards, Svante (https://x.com/svantetobias) \n\n(sorry if this is not exactly the purpose of the Introduction channel, I hope it's close enough)",
