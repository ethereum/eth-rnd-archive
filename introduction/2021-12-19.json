Feel free to explore and if you are looking for a beginner-friendly channel for EIP discussion, you are most welcome at Ethereum Cats \u0026 Herders which is an integral part of Ethereum R\u0026D https://discord.gg/xzqqu49BYq\n\n\nAlso recently EIP-4361, related to authentication took off and got merged at the EIP Github repo. It could help you start off. \nEIP-4361 ➡️  Sign-In with Ethereum describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain services by signing a standard message format parameterized by scope, session details, and security mechanisms https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1471868488679575558?t=GA8pAQaIJS3GRqQBkKGQQA\u0026s=19",
