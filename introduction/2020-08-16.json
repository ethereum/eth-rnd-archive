    "content": "Hey all,\n\nKevin Owocki here.  Been doing startups for 12 years, always leveraging open source but never really finding a good way to give back.  Now I’m at Gitcoin whose mission is to provide economic models for OSS devs. You may have heard of Gitcoin Grants/QF, which is one model for doing so. I have a BS degree in computer science, but these days am mostly focused on business things.  I’m here to hang out, lurk and learn some of the leading tech, and maybe if I’m lucky get into some cool convos about economic models for public goods.",
