        "content": "Hi folks! I'm the sole inventor on the patent that introduced the tracking cookie (and coined that term), although it didn't claim the tracking cookie as an independent invention; this was back in 1995. (My name is Gary Robinson. A recent legal brief filed jointly by Google and Twitter referred to it as \"Robinson's cookie\". US Patent #5,918,014.) I wrote an influential Linux Journal article on a statistical approach to spam filtering and was, as far as there's any info, the first person to come up with the idea of collaborative filtering and used it in a commercial setting in the 80s. I'm an old geezer (67). I'm extremely interested in Ethereum and would be very interested in working professionally in this space if an appropriate opportunity were to be available. This would all be to try to make up for the tracking cookie. 😂   (Actually, my patent talks about features for user control of their data which the industry didn't see fit to use.)",
