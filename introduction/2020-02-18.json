I've worked in all different aspects of product development, and I work a lot in front-end stuff as well as games, apps, augmented reality, virtual reality, blockchain, etc. Basically, I work on whatever is necessary to move things forward. \n\nI'm very exhausted from ETHDenver, and I had an awesome time. 🙂",
