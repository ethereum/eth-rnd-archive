        "content": "Ethereum is trying to solve the blockchain trilemma. That means achieving security, scalability, and decentralization at the same time. Currently, at best blockchains have only achieved two of these and sacrificed a third. Ethereum is addressing scalability, which will start with switching it’s consensus model to something called Proof of Stake, then adding something called sharding, encouraging individuals to run nodes and contribute to the network, and finally addressing data storage issues with block expiry. This is all a part of a 5-8 year Roadmap I think.\n\nBut there are many people using Ethereum. Outside of it still gaining popularity it’s scalability issues make it prohibitively expensive to use as adoption increases. High traffic means the cost to users in gas fees that make the network run get very high.",
