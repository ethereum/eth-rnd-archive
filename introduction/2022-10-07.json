I am a YC alum (https://www.ycombinator.com/) and I was previously working on an (intercom-style) live stream widget for ecommerce stores. \n\nDuring my previous work I was always interested in web3 and now I am looking to start building something in the space and also looking for a technical co-founder. If you are interested or want to give an intro to someone, don't hesitate to reach out! \n\nHere is more info about myself: https://robrechtlr.com/lfg",
