    "content": "Hi, I am working on programmatically analyzing every contract in Ethereum (and a few other EVM chains) that has verified Solidity source code to see how closely their functions and events match various ERCs. A few observations:\n- A significant number of contracts implement most but not all of the standard. For instance, the most common violations for ERC 20 include implementing all the functions but not emitting any events, and not returning a success bool for transfer, transferFrom, and approve.\n- A surprisingly high percentage of verified contracts are ERC 20 (if we allow for some leniency with the two common aforementioned violations). I haven't done a complete run yet - this is just on a couple hundred thousand contract on Ethereum and only three ERCs. The proportions may drop significantly after including older contracts and those deployed with internal transactions:\n```\n     7.06% ERC721 frequency\n     1.42% ERC1155 frequency\n    31.12% ERC20 frequency\n```\nThe proportion of ERC 20 is even higher on BSC.\n- The majority (in my search so far) of ERC20 and ERC721 (and possibly others) contracts use different naming conventions for event parameters. For instance, the Transfer event is defined as `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)` in the EIP https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20 but it usually appears as `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)` instead, including on OpenZeppelin https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.8.0/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol. Although, I believe event parameter names don't actually affect on-chain data, so perhaps the naming can be ignored.",
