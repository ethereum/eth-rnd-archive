I don't write about Web3.0 or blockchain stuff, though I'd love to do so at some point. My biggest fear with writing about Web3.0 or blockchain is becoming associated with a project that ends up being a rugpull. I would hate it if my work ended up being used for such a venture due to my lack of knowledge. \n\nMy primary motivation for being here is just to lurk and absorb what knowledge I can through osmosis. Any suggestions on core knowledge are appreciated",
