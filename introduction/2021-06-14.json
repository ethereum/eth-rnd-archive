I built prototypes, APIs, and managed a few products at Keller Williams. I spent some time at building a real-time non-custodial 3rd party finance SDK at AppBrilliance, and I built a social media music streaming app with some friends. Currently i'm doing front end work for a web3 company and would love to expand my skillset down the web3 stack!",
