        "content": "Hi all!\n\nwe were building a hardware crypto wallet hito, but during our way came up with the idea how to make web3-native KYC (in conjunction with Proof of Humanity or potentially any other ID protocol) that will allow the crypto-fiat conjunction for the verified addresses (including withdrawing) without opening ID documents to the wallet or exchange. \n\nare here any discussions about KYC we can join to discuss and challenge our thought with people who are already thinking about KYC from any point?\n\nIn a short the thought is the following: a new-generated key in a hardware wallet + physical address registered for the delivery (as a proof of residence) + identity verification on the Proof of Humanity side \n\nWill appreciate any comments, ideas, whom to talk, what to read etc etc",
