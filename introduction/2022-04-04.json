Right now with mining, the latency/stales is a huge incentive to have the pool as close as possible to the miners, and the miners are in general close to the people that own/run them and  people that mine are distributed around the world. When POS arrives as the new consensus protocol, won't there no-longer be any incentive to spread nodes around the world and result in all the nodes coalescing on one particular datacenter or city?",
