Mostly trying to be an information sponge right now but exploring client implementations, distributed validator architecture, and some PL related stuff (like,`\u003cinsert language\u003e` to `EVM` compilers). Feel free to hit me up, especially if you're doing anything PL related - I'd love to get involved with that!",
