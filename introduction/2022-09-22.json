Recently we've developed Relic Protocol (https://docs.relicprotocol.com/litepaper/#technology), which enables accessing historical Ethereum state from inside the EVM. For our initial launch, we've achieved decent scalability using zk-SNARKs and gas-optimized verifiers, but we hope to bring costs down even more by using upcoming Ethereum scaling improvements.\n\nI will most likely be here discussing data sharding, verkle trees, and zk-SNARKs, as we see these as promising ways to continue scaling the protocol!",
