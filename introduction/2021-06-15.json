    "content": "Hi all, I'm an engineer at a tech company and have been for the past 5 years. I've worked professionally with several languages and frameworks, and more consider myself a \"swiss army knife\" type of programmer. I've done a lot of back end code recently but in the years before I had a job I did a lot of front end or full stack work too. I've done a few of the hacks with ETH Global as starters which were fun and also some DeFi stuff for learning but I want to get more into fundamental Ethereum development. Looking forward to working with you all",
