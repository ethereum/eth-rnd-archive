We have developed and maintain a FOSS solution for deploying nodes abstracting the technical complexity and we have a completely decentralized DAppStore (repository on Eth, content on IPFS), ENS integration, and deployment of eth2 validators (currently prysm).\n\nOur vision is of truly decentralized infrastructure, where everyone can deploy and run nodes and DApps locally in their dappnode machine and never use a 3rd party. The benefits in terms of privacy and sovereignty for the individual user also carry a benefit for the network, which becomes more resilient with every domestic node. \n\nWe provide an SDK for any project to distribute on DAppNode, which provide useful UX features like a setup wizard, getting started section, decentralized auto-updates... \n\nBeen a long time lurker here - happy to start contributing more actively!",
