I've never had the university education etc. I'm not an expert by any means - I continue to practice and push my learning all the time. My skillset includes C#, Unity3D, Solidity, JS, Blockchain related tools and a couple more that I'm somewhat familiar working with, I'm always willing to learn and adapt. I have plenty of time up my sleeve, really enjoy it and happy to work with like-minded people to learn, experiment, develop and build with! Feel free to reach out for any reason, I'm always happy to help however I can, Thanks!",
