I’m currently working on a smart contract project using Replit + Hardhat, and I'm trying to deploy it to the Base network (Sepolia testnet or mainnet).\n\nI'm still new to blockchain dev, so I’m looking for someone who can help me with the deployment setup — including RPC config, wallet integration, and deploying the contract.\n\n✅ Ideally you have experience with deploying to Base\n✅ I’m open to paid help / short-term mentorship\n\nAlso — if you're passionate about education, crypto, or new ways of learning, there's an opportunity to join our team as well! We’re building something exciting and would love to collaborate long-term if there’s a good fit. 🙌\n\nFeel free to DM me if you're interested — thank you so much!",
