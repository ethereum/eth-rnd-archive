    "content": "My journey kinda started with a simple curiosity—just wondering how trust could actually be written into code, and how machines could be taught a bit of intelligence. Along the way, that curiosity pulled me into blockchains, where I’ve worked on systems that turn this abstract idea of consensus into something real, something people can actually rely on. And it also led me into AI, where algorithms stop feeling like just formulas and start acting more like tools that actually help solve problems we used to think were impossible.\nAt the end of the day, it’s not only about cranking out code for me. I honestly believe that when blockchain and AI are put together in the right way, they can shift how industries move, how communities connect, and even how new ideas come to life.",
