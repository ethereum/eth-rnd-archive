Professionally, I work on Microservices development, Backend stack, Kubernetes, Cloud native tech.  I've built few Ethereum DApps as hobby projects and I've worked with a team that was building some NFT based application. I'm every excited to be part of this discord channel. \n\nLooking forward to contribute and get involved wherever possible. \n\nThanks",
