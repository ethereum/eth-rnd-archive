        "content": "Hello fellow Eth bros 😀. I'm Richard Gregory, but I'm better known as Cardo in the Crypto World. As a millennial, I naturally gravitated toward Ethereum. I'm from Nigeria, and Open Source has always been the only way I've found to solve real-world problems that affect millions of people. Excited to be here.\n\nI've worked with several languages, but my primary tool is Python. That's why I'm currently pushing code to Executions Specs Test. AI has made coding 10 times easier, and I find myself holding back to avoid overwhelming the maintainers. Haha.\n\nI'm also interested in Golang. I would love to learn more about Ethereum clients by contributing to GETH, but there aren't many open issues. So I occasionally play around with Nethermind. \n\nI have not made extraordinary contributions to Ethereum, but Ethereum has been extremely rewarding to me. I have ambitions of becoming a full-stack or general-purpose Software Engineer with Ethereum or an Ethereum-aligned organisation such as Optimism, Nethermind or Coinbase. Contributing is a way to keep my coding skills sharp and also learn and breathe Ethereum.\n\nSee you in the open-source trenches, and possibly at a conference",
