Studied applied math, mainly statistics and everything data related.\nBeen interested in eth since 2017, but almost exclusively as a topic I enjoyed learning about, so I've never actually been involved in the development side of the eco-system.\n\nI'm missing a big part of the technical background and knowledge to directly be involved in here, so I plan on lurking mainly, until I understand how stuff works and feel like I can actually contribute in a positive manner.\n\nI'll be glad to exchange with you all 😄\nAli",
