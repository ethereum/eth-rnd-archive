I was looking at the definition of `is_slashable_validator`:\n```\ndef is_slashable_validator(validator: Validator, epoch: Epoch) -> bool:\n    return (not validator.slashed) and (validator.activation_epoch <= epoch < validator.withdrawable_epoch)\n```\nSo it seems that validators are slashable even after they have exited. I was wondering if this is actually currently possible, since as far as I know validators cannot attest/propose anymore after exiting, so how would they get slashed?",
