    "content": "Hi guys, I'm with RockLogic (Stereum) and we're probably kicking off a benchmarking project to better understand how different Ethereum clients behave in practice. The idea is to run every EC/CC (and later on VC/DVT/...) in fully isolated envs. We’re collecting both system level data (CPU, memory, IOPS, storage usage, bandwidth, ...) and client specific metrics (sync behavior, error logs, sync com subs, ...) to get a clear picture of each client’s resource footprint and stability profile as well as long term data (as far as it makes sense). Tooling as well as feeding data to ethpandaops could be also a goal.\n\nWe’re planning to test also around different EC/CC combos, configurations, versions, pruning/db modes, and other client flags. Everything is being logged and versioned (including client and OS updates), and we’re tagging those changes in the charts to correlate with performance shifts or anomalies. The goal is to get more insights into which clients work well together, how config choices impact resource use and performance, and what kind of issues pop up.\n\nI know this is important for us (RockLogic) but if this sounds also useful to you or you got some contacts that might be interested in it I'm looking forward to get in touch and discuss further. I'm already in touch with <@199561711278227457> and <@732277780720517222> , as well as got recommended by <@981258909899718716> (I hope that's you) to ask here.",
