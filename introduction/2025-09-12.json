    "content": "👋 I’ve been building in the blockchain space for over 8 years, working on all kinds of projects—smart contracts, DEXs, wallets, DeFi protocols, trading bots, dApps, you name it. I’ve also worked across different ecosystems (EVM chains, Solana, Cardano, etc.), so I’m comfortable adapting to whatever a project needs. I really enjoy diving into the details, solving tricky problems, and bringing new blockchain ideas to life. Right now, I’m looking to join a solid project in development and contribute my experience to help make it happen. If you’re building something exciting, I’d love to connect and see how I can get involved. 🚀",
