(If not appropriate here, pls point me to where I should discuss this)\n\nOne of the topics I'd like to discuss is how Ethereum plans to be more user friendly in the future. If i think of my grandma, its probably intuitive to her that if she wants to use solana, she should use the solana chain. In a rollup-centric ethereum eco however, she should use ethereum, but actually transact on, say, Optimism. I fear that even after 4844, people will continue to complain about L1 fees, since the default chain is L1 and not a (or more) L2(s). \n\nFrom a UX perspective, is it possible to have apps/wallets etc transact using L2s as a default? If we want to scale using L2s, we need to move the users and liquidity over there as well, and it needs to be friendly to new users.\n\nWould something like account abstraction be a possible tool to fix this? Is this a concern that is in discussion already (im sure it is) and if so, where is that happening?",
