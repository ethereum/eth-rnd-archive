        "content": "Thank you for your answer. But I have trouble understanding the gas estimator. So you said that I pay: priority fee + current base fee. When I look at the gas estimator I see that current base fee is 64.85 gwei and priority fee is 2.00 gwei, so this is in total 66.85 gwei. When I convert gwei to a dollar I get 66.85 gwei = $0,000157. This less then a penny. This can't be right.",
