My name is Tobias and I'm interested to run a private little validator on eth2.0 and I'm general interested in all (or at least a lot of) eth2.0 related stuff. Furthermore I really believe in the vision of web3 so the Ethereum ecosystem is the place to be 🙂 . Beside that I realized that it is really cool to help people if they have issues so I'm doing this in the lighthouse channels as I'm currently try to focus on this client. I focus on this client because I'm interested in Rust and also started to learn it. So maybe at some point in time I will be able to open code-related issues on github  😉 . But of course I know the multi-client nature of ethereum and eth2.0 so I will definitely check the other clients as well. BTW: I think everybody really appreciates the hard work you guys are doing, bringing eth2.0 to live. Thanks for this.",
