In order to ensure a smooth experience for end users: with documentation, releases, tooling and stable clients, we'd like to delay the testnet to next week. \n\nWe would still have a devnet this week instead, the devnet would require a minimum of kiln v1 + renaming from v2 as discussed earlier. This would allow us to still test the spec and yet gain some time for the more public testnet. \n\nIf all client teams are ready next week, we would like to launch kiln with the full v2 spec, i.e, with auth as well. \n\nConfigs and information about merge-devnet-5 would be made available tomorrow morning, if client teams still want to take part in running validators - please do let me know. The PoW phase for the devnet will be quite long, so anyone should be able to join pre-merge.",
