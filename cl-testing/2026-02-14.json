    "content": "Hey, I've been building an open-source EIP compliance checker that compares spec constraints against client source code. Ran it against Nethermind's EIP-1559 implementation and it flagged some interesting findings — including the FeeCollector property. Filed an issue: [https://github.com/Fosurero/PRSpec]. Would love to hear if this kind of automated spec review tool would be useful for the team",
