With Besu we are failing the test `eth_getBlockByNumber/get-block-n` because we are not returning `type` for a transaction and because we return 3 extra fields for a transaction, which are `chainId`, `publicKey` and `raw`.\n\n* `type`: we will add this, that is not a problem\n* `chainId`: this seems to be part of the spec. Shouldn't it be included?\n* `publicKey` and `raw`: Those are not part of the spec, but I am afraid of breaking third party applications by removing them. Could we make the test ignore extra fields? I don't see any harm in having additional information.",

        "content": "Hello! Yes, we recently added the rpc-compat tests to start the conversation around improving rpc compatibility have a better spec driven standardization process for the rpc. The tests there are really just the starting point to make sure things are working end to end, e.g. we can go from the spec to generate tests and into hive. I'm currently working on standardizing the debug namespace and basically piloting this whole system.\n\nOkay, your questions:\n* yeah i think the `chainId` should be there - we recently fixed this in geth where we return the chain id for legacy txs if they have the EIP-155 chainid included, i may have accidentally generated the tests with the wrong version of geth - I will look into it\n* additional fields - I realize that some clients are providing additional information on top of what the standard specifies, but I think perpetuates the problem we have with conformance. In the ideal world, users should be free to use any EL client with any tool that uses the json-rpc. However, if clients are providing different information and tools happen to start relying on that information, we get into a situation where the EL is no longer a black box and it actually matters what which EL you're running and what additional fields it exposes",

It's just that testnets with open validator sets are much harder to maintain long term because there's no incentive to run a validator, so having one where client + infra teams control validators provides more reliability to end users. Some current testnets work like this, where Rinkeby and Goerli have permissioned validator sets.",

While is true that we will be testing the transition on each of the major testnets, the actual testing of the transition is being made on the countless shadow forks and hive testings, etc.  Validators and users alike will not need to actively do anything at the fork itself, they should be testing that their applications and their staking software and setup works, and this can be done in any merged testnet, in particular it can be done right now in Ropsten and it can be done by running a validator in Prater now or after it has merged. Testnets are to continuously test execution, consensus and user experience, not principally designed to test one-time events like forks (although they run these forks typically before mainnet).",
