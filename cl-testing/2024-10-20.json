It seems that calling the `updates` api with `period=1` and `count=1` is returning `{\"code\":500,\"message\":\"No partialUpdate available for period 1\"}`. Given we are currently in period 1 on the devnet, shouldn't an update be available for period 1 now so that light clients can refresth their next sync committee value? Can someone from the Chainsafe team confirm this?",
