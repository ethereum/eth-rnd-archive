        "content": "I followed https://github.com/parithosh/consensus-deployment-ansible#instructions-to-join-testnet (using geth/teku) to join Pithos and my nodes are synced but I've noticed that the EL seems to only be getting new blocks from the CL in \"bursts\" several minutes apart.  For example if I watch newHeads the new blocks are few and far between:\n\n```\n$ echo '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"id\": 1123123, \"method\": \"eth_subscribe\", \"params\": [\"newHeads\"]}' | sudo nc -U /mnt/local/pithos/execution_data/geth.ipc | grep -o '\"number\":\"0x[[:alnum:]]*\"'\n\"number\":\"0x32458\"\n\"number\":\"0x32483\"\n\"number\":\"0x324b0\"\n\"number\":\"0x324e0\"\n\"number\":\"0x3250c\"\n\"number\":\"0x32530\"\n\"number\":\"0x3254e\"\n\"number\":\"0x32577\"\n```\n\nThe logs for both layers corroborate this behavior, teku seems to `engine_executePayload` batches of 30-45 blocks every ~10m or so rather than a steady trickle of new blocks.  In between I see a bunch of \"Slot Event\" logs:\n\n```\n18:07:40.211 INFO  - Slot Event  *** Slot: 253813, Block:    ... empty, Epoch: 7931, Finalized checkpoint: 7929, Finalized root: 4197b0..2614, Peers: 18\n```\n\nBut nothing else.  Is this maybe due to spotty peering leading to my CL hearing about the new blocks in bursts?\n\n(Also is this the right channel for these sorts of questions?)",
