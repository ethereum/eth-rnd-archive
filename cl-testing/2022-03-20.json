The way it is now with EL reporting \"EngineExchangeTransitionConfiguration | not called in 120 seconds, consensus client may not be connected\" just creates confusion that things may or may not be ok. It either is OK or it isn't. People will see this as a health check but engine_exchangeTransitionConfigurationV1 seems to have a different purpose.",
