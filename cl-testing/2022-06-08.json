So you're either getting slashed or leak just as much. Some will get into the exit queue early and escape but there will be a huge loss to get the correct chain finalizing.  Same as with a super majority CL.",

I guess it could be related to the pre-merge stall you saw. \n\nAs 11crygpt said, I see lodestar downscoring peers and having fewer of them. But no other consequence of the log message you posted.\n\nI'm extremely glad that you had all the client pairs running, its suuuuper useful to cross check if its an isolated config issue or not.
