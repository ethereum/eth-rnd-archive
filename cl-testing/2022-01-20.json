It won't do an initial launch without `--miner-coinbase` but it ignores it and proceeds because `--miner-enabled` wasn't passed.",

I have been thinking if one can come up with more efficient protocol. I don't know enough about the topic to know if that's possible or not. Algorand also has one solution, but it also has some features that I am not fan of.",
