Although now that you have brought it up we should definitely have it filling in the latest release!\n\nI can generate this for you just now if it helps re.debugging?",

Because the way geth handles this case is it cannot deserialize a TX that is missing an address (the same thing you're describing for `t8n`). And for eth_call we use a different serialization so the check needed to be added there too.",
