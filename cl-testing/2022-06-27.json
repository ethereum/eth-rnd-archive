        "content": "Hi, I haven't followed on all the testing that is being done financed by the EF. I'm interested in one particular line of testing and I'd like to know if this is being carried out or not before I set on the task of doing it. I would want to create a network fork without finalization for a couple of days, stop a node wait a few hours and relaunch it. That is, I want to test if a node that has the latest finalized point in db plus a few forks but possibly missing some justified points, can sync from the network. I'm worried that we've made many changes since this code was actually needed in runtime and we haven't been testing this at scale, and these are the sort of things that are only urgent when you need them. Perhaps \u003c@219015859182632960\u003e has been testing this?",
