Or any other devs focused on e2e testing and tooling there free for some brainstorming chats this week? One of the modules I’m building for a larger project could help make progress on lots of these discussions around faucets, testnet setups, etc but would be great to hear from some of you first hand around your biggest pain points and gaps in current tooling. I’d also make these libraries OS/MIT licensed so anyone could use it, since I think they’d have way more value for the community than privately held and I’d be building this sort of tech already for what I need, but I’d really like such an OS library contribution to be as useful as possible instead of just being a thoughtless offhand clone from something I build internal or being overly complex to the general audience, or relying too heavily on tech that’s difficult to setup or understand how to use properly.",
