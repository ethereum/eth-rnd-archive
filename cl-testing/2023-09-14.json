Seems like it requires we accept txs enabled in cancun before cancun is activated. At first I thought we could fix this by allowing txs N seconds / blocks before cancun activates, but the genesis timestamp of the test is 0x1234 so I think it would only be satisfied if we make it so that we accept blob txs if cancun is scheduled for the network at all.",
