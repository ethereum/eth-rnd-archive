        "content": "Hey Pari! I hope this helps. And if anyone spots an error please speak up!!!\n\nWhen I combine 2 validators with maxEB, what validator index does the new validator have?\n\n\u003e When validators are consolidated, the whole active balance of the source validator is decreased, and it is \"tranfered\" to the target validator (increased by the same amount). Therefore, target validator is the one that will remain active and with the whole balance. Source validator exit is initated as part of the creation of the consolidation_request.\n\nCan i consolidate validators that are just deposited, i.e, pending_initialized or pending_queued or any of the other states that are not active_ongoing. Same question for all the other states too. Is it somehow defined what states the validator must be in to be eligible for consolidation?\n\n\u003e When creating a consolidation request, the protocol checks that both validators are active (we check is_active_validator) and that they have not initiated an exit already. So they need to be active_ongoing.\n\nCan i consolidate a consolidated validator? i.e, add a 32 eth validator to a consolidated validator with 2015eth?\n\n\u003e Yes. Let's say you have validators A, B and C. You can consolidate (A,B) -\u003e B; and then (B, C) -\u003e C.\n\nCan the custom celing be changed once set?\n\n\u003e Not sure if you are asking about the max effective balance of 2048 in Electra? If this is the question, the answer is that we won't allow this to change for now. At least last time I checked we didn't 🙂\n\ne.g: validator with 2048 ETH and churn limit of 8. Implies per epoch 8x32(256eth) can exit, so does this mean for 8 epochs no one else can exit? Or does the validator stall till the churn limit hits 64 and 1 epoch can accomodate its exit?\n\n\u003e I believe we maintain the same intent as before. We do not want drastic changes in the amount of staked eth. So if a large validator exits, other exits will be \"delayed\".",

        "content": "Thanks for the answers! 😄\n\nfew follow ups:\n- `Can the custom celing be changed once set?`, I meant this: `Permitting validators to set custom ceilings for their validator to indicate where the partial withdrawal sweep activates.`, so my maxEB might be 2000ETH and my custom celing might be 2001ETH right? So partial withdrawals will sweep anything above 2001ETH\n- `So if a large validator exits, other exits will be \"delayed\".`, so this would imply a large validator goes first and then no one else can exit until a churn of a equal amount of validator eth has passed right? i.e this example case? `validator with 2048 ETH and churn limit of 8. Implies per epoch 8x32(256eth) can exit, so does this mean for 8 epochs no one else can exit`",
