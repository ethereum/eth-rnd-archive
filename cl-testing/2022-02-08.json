        "content": "To kickoff the 2022 testnet season, I've created a doc here to list branch/docker image information (entered version/branch should be compatible with kiln spec v1) : https://notes.ethereum.org/@ExXcnR0-SJGthjz1dwkA1A/ryoL1py1q/edit\n\nThe current plan is to have `merge-devnet-4` by the end of the week if there's enough interest. It'd be great if participating client teams can update the doc linked above and perhaps send me a small list of changes I might need to make to flags/deployments (if any) 😄\n\nIncase someone has already tried interop or local testnets with other clients, do let me know! \n\nTo help with local testing, the team from Kurtosis has built something awesome for us. We now have the ability to spin up a multi-client, local merge testnet. This could be really valuable to test client changes against known working versions of other clients. We'd look into potential integration testing in the future. Kurtosis also supports writing tests modules, if someone has ideas, do reach out. \n\nInformation on how to get started can be found in this note: https://notes.ethereum.org/@ExXcnR0-SJGthjz1dwkA1A/H11OzhRAK\nCurrent version numbers, etc in the kurtosis docs are pinned to kintsugi, once we have newer versions for kiln I can update it and client teams can use kurtosis until the devnet is launched.\n\nPotential workflow for client teams:\nBuild/test locally -\u003e Test few combinations with kurtosis -\u003e Test large scale on weekly devnet/Kiln -\u003e Make public releases/rc's",

        "content": "Hi all 🙂\n\nThis is Diego from Ethereum on ARM.\n\nWe've released a Kintsugi image for the Raspberry Pi 4. It is Plug and play so it does all the necessary configuration and includes all clients ready to run through systemd services. For instance, if you want to run Geth and Lighthouse as EL+CL just start both services by running:\n\n`sudo systemctl start geth-lh \u0026\u0026 sudo systemctl start lh-geth-beacon`\n\nAdditionally, we published an AWS ARM64 AMI for users that want to give it a try but don't have a Raspberry Pi (it is the same image but for this environment).\n\nPlease take a look at our docs for further info:\n\nhttps://ethereum-on-arm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kintsugi/kintsugi-testnet.html\n\nFeel free to join our Discord or post here your feedback.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/jU9cP64mPe\n\nThanks!",

The `gas` values and fee values used to post correctly but then diminish to some low value after some time. Always felt like the issue was at the block explorer (or API) level... but seems to not do it anymore though.\n\nLooks like your tx was from 2 months ago but those values are still wonky in the explorer I suppose?",
