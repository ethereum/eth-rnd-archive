        "content": "Hello, as some of you know, my team is doing a performance analysis of all clients. We will be contacting your teams in case of questions or for debugging. The goal of this project is not to say \"X is good, Y is bad\" but rather to provide feedback to client teams, to publish data for the whole community and in general to be as constructive as possible for the benefit of the ecosystem. While we would love to go into a deep detailed analysis of the different optimizations applied by different teams, this work is more to make sure most clients are ready for the merge and provide corrective guidelines when needed. Hopefully, this data can be of support for those running nodes/validators to have a clear vision of the whole spectrum of clients available and their performance.",
