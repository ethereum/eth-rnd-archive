If you know anyone running a miner, please ask them to stop it 🙂\n\nIts crazy hard to estimate when TTD happens on these testnets since we have no idea what hashpower will join in. It's a biiit easier to do if we control all the miners.",

That's because the author just copy-pasted instruction out of context. When you execute the commands one after the other as prompted by the guide, you can't get a single consensus layer to run. There are inconsistencies between the actual state of my machine when I follow the guide and the command I'm prompted to execute. That make it impossible to run a Kiln node by following this guide. Which is sad, because it is the only purpose of this guide.",
