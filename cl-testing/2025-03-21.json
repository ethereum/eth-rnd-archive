Next time round they will do the same but end up with two 102 ETH validators.\n\nActive stake management appears to be a thing.  Not sure about the benefit, I'll try to run some numbers over the weekend.",

If we want to make it fair then i think we will have to split the logic of upwards into two parts: same as today if EB is lower than `MIN_ACTIVATION_BALANCE` and apply a strict hysteresis above that value. Alternatively, the new logic can be applied to compounding validators only",
