        "content": "It depends on the setup. If VC is on the same machine as BN then the task of finding VC address is reduced to finding BN address that is serving particular validator which isn't that hard considering trivial heuristics like BN subscription to subnets and other more advance heuristics exist.\n\nIf VC is connected to multiple BNs via intranet it's hard to figure out VC address. And as you've mentioned VC connected to multiple BNs is more resistant to DoS attacks as it's always has fallback BNs, and potentially disseminates blocks and attestations through several BNs at the moment (or all of them).",

But I would think that you don't need to DOS that many IP's to take majority of validator power out.\n\nAnyway, after a such attack has been conducted, I believe validators would enforce their defenses. So the attack is probably only going to be super effective for a short while. Unfortunately such defenses make it more and more expensive to run validators and we get economies of scale",

I've generated CL state file (`genesis.ssz`) using my mnemonic and 70 validators (pubkeys). After chain started (CL genesis time reached) CL was able to attest and submit blocks... How it's possible?",

The `eth2-testnet-genesis` tool adds the deposits based on information from `mnemonics.yaml`, which you defined and hence have a different validator set from Kintsugi. Your CL chain is just going to be different than the Kintsugi chain, it just happens to have the same EL deposit contract. You can reuse the EL deposit contract across as many CL chain as you like. Even if you choose the same fork version, your genesis state would be different and no kintsugi node *should* peer with you or accept your blocks in the canonical chain.",
