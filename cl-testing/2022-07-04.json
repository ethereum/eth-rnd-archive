There needs to be a way to add in-development and experimental data for future evolution.  It also makes it difficult for clients (both EL and CL) to provide value-added features outside of the engine pairing.  \"revert reason\" is an excellent example of this, a critical value add to end users but not a standard field in transaction receipts.",
