I.e. the format is correct, the payload is correct but this format does not meant to be used in the `transactions` list?\n\nIf this is the case then `INVALID` would be the response; `invalid params` is for the case when CL messes up with the params while this is clearly not this type of situation. This is more the payload has been built incorrectly, like if there were a malformed RLP string in it.",
