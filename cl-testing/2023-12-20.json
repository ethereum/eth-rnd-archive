We have some bundled Code settings and recommended plugins (.vscode/extensions.json) included in the repo which have some helpful settings. If you rename the settings file as documented (see link below) and restart code, it will then prompt you to install the recommended extensions.\n\nAfter this setup, upon saving your file in VS Code, it will be auto-formatted in the required (\"black\") format and your module imports will be sorted as required by `isort` (the current reason why `tox` is failing in your PR).\n\nAdditionally, the linter will highlight any other problems.\n\nTyping/typehints (getting `mypy` to run cleanly) can be trickier, I'm happy to help there if there's any issues!\n\nCould you try to setup Code as described here and see if that helps?\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/execution-spec-tests/main/getting_started/setup_vs_code/",
