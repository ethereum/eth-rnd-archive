        "content": "Hey there, we fixed the test 🙂 We had a wrong setup in our test runner which never transitioned to Prague 😅 \n\nI have some feedback for the 2935 transition tests though. I think that:\n\n(1) There should be a test which generates more blocks than `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` until the fork block. This tests that the (currently) 8192 blocks are stored and not more (yes this will be a rather large file because you need to generate 8192+ blocks 😅 )\n(2) Test (1) can be expanded by building more blocks on top of the fork block, this ensures that block hashes in the contract are overwritten and not stored into \"wrong\" storage slots\n(3) (This might already be in the non-transitioning tests): Ensure the contract is filled with 8192 blocks and now call BLOCKHASH on the contract for some arbitrary numbers (e.g. `block.header.number - 1`, `block.header.number - 256`, `block.header.number - 8191`, `block.header.number - 8192`, `block.header.number - 8193`) - this ensures BLOCKHASH can now read 8192 past blocks instead of the last 256. (Also test the contract by calling it, instead of using BLOCKHASH opcode - although this is maybe somewhat optional since this tests the contract implementation 🤔 )",
