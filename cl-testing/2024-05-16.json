It looks like we do everything right except we set the slot of storage key 1 to 0, instead of `1` as should be in the test. This is the result of `ISZERO` after `AUTH` (so the test expects that `AUTH` somehow does not setup the stack for the right `AUTH`). However, as far as I can see it all looks correct to me 🤔 Any pointers?",
