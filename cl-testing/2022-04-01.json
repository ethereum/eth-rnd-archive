        "content": "Couple of updates from the `goerliShadowfork2`(merged day before):\n- We had a \"safe\" validator split\n- We have been finalising since TTD\n- We did identify some minor issues/assumptions in client teams already, patches being tested now. So fluctuating participation, but remains well above the minimum needed.\n\nSince the previous shadow fork went relatively well, we want to re-attempt it with a mainnet split. \n\nThe plan is for it to hit TTD on Monday. The related beaconchain goes live later today. Configs can be found here: https://github.com/eth-clients/merge-testnets/tree/main/goerli-shadow-fork-3\n\nTooling links:\n- https://rpc.goerlishadowfork3.ethdevops.io\n- https://beaconchain.goerlishadowfork3.ethdevops.io\n- https://explorer.goerlishadowfork3.ethdevops.io\n- https://ethstats.goerlishadowfork3.ethdevops.io\n\nThis shadow fork is meant to just be another sync target to test against. `goerliShadowfork2` will still be around till we deprecate it. The aim is to see if the mainnet split brings out any issues. No client team is expected to run their own validators or anything, but it'd be great if you can help by keeping an eye out on the nodes spun up by the EF + attempt weird sync styles. \n\nI'm parallely working on a mainnet shadow fork with mainnet split, expect configs later today. We aren't sure if enough PRs/fixes are merged for it to make sense, but we'd rather just do it to collect some data. Its better that it breaks now rather than later. The aim is for `mainnetShadowfork1` to be next Thursday (So start syncing your nodes!)",
