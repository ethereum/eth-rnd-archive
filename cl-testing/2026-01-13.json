        "content": "Getting back to the CL hardening discussion. As I mentioned on the call, we are planning to work on a model based testing suite for ePBS state transition and fork choice. And what we haven't touched much during the call is integration of that tooling, specifically resource allocation for that task. I expect CL devs will find capacity to integrate changes in the test format that will allow to run those new ePBS tests. The difference from the integration of the fork choice compliance test suite we did before is that ePBS testing is on the critical path to Glamsterdam delivery thus it isn't unreasonable to put core devs resource into a testing front this time",
