Since a lot of projects are forking geth, they will rename the networking protocol `eth` to something else. \nIf they connect to your node, we will reject them, because they have `snap` but not `eth` network protocols and throw this error.\nIt should be downgraded to a warning, but there's some additional complexity. Best to just ignore it.",

What are some things you'd like to see with regards to this? Would a view where you can see the current status \u0026 state of each client be useful? What values would you want for each EL and CL?",
