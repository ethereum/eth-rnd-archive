Originally Teku stopped calling engine_transitionConfiguration once the merge was done as we were calling other methods that gave a better indication of things being setup right, but we had to change that and keep calling because besu would produce these warnings and even if besu was changed, there's no way to know if the EL was past the merge block yet or not so we could get these warnings again at unexpected times.  It may just be that other CLs are still stopping at the merge point.  Either way it's not a big deal if you can see things working fine otherwise - the config check is only useful prior to the merge as a sanity check.",
