Client teams already have enough on their plate and running another testnet the size of prater is both economically and logistically unfeasible. Deprecating goerli would take too long, a lot of orgs just moved to goerli now after ropsten was deprecated. It'd be unfair to ask them to move again so quickly, besides it'll take a while for the ecosystem (rpc, explorers, etc) to catch up. \n\nWe can launch a new beaconchain on sepolia for e.g, one that isn't permissioned. But if we have x stakers join in and abandon their setup soon after, we'll quickly have an unusable setup. The solutions would have to be on the lines of: guaranteed exiting or somehow performing a re-genesis every few months. \n\nI guess going back to https://github.com/eth-clients/goerli/issues/97 and seeing how we can inflate the supply might be the easiest path forward :/",
