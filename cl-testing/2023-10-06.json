Happy to be wrong, but I was sure enough to gather the info in an issue: https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/issues/6166\n\nIn general, we could get a faster turn-around if Nethermind retrieved the execution-spec-test fixtures directly, instead of via ethereum/tests. We have them available on our Github releases page, but are open to other suggestions! https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/",
