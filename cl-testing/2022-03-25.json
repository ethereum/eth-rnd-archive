This just happened because the explorer runs on the bootnode and I tend to set up bootnodes manually. It's been fixed now, but the remnant of the forgetfullnes exists in the missing attestation+proposals from when the node was down. I'll rebuild that db in a bit. \n\nI'll update everyone with a more detailed split about client performance, etc after I'm properly awake 😅",
