The actual execution blocktime will be 12 seconds down from  about 13 right now. Reason I am asking is that we encountered some unique edge cases in one of our devnets, around eth1data voting at the merge epoch. Although in our case it was exacerbated by more extreme parameters(ex: 2 second execution block time pre-merge)",

The deposits were onboarded as validators as expected and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I don't think we looked into eth1data voting explicitly since everything else looked good. \n\nWould there be some specific test you'd suggest? Perhaps performing a deposit and checking the eth1votes on all the clients?",

This should be done with a large amount of deposits being sent, you can have this right by the merge epoch/after. From the start to the middle of the voting period, look at eth1data votes by different clients. If everything is good it should all be the same, however if there is a consistent  split in eth1data votes carried out by different clients then there might be an issue",
