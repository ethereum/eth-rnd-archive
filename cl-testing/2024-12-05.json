        "content": "1) it is not allowed to deposit to exiting validator (including the source of consolidation) and we have tests for that; it's impossible to consolidate to a validator that is exiting, but if target has exited while there are pending consolidations it seems fine as the balance will be just moved and then swept. All that and other flows should be handled by a validator state testing suite that i am working on (just need to finish it), https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/validator_state_testing\n4) we don't want to have a queue on EL to grow without any limitation, if there are many consolidations submitted in one block than the fee will be same for each of them. So first consolidations will have a really low fee, then it will increase after the first block is processed and so on. All request transactions will fail before Prague is activated but there is not limitation on submitting them to the mempool\n5) Request contracts uses the same fee computation as used in 4844, so it is already fixed one",
