        "content": "Don't know if this is the right place to raise this, but it's my best guess. I'm seeing weird behaviour on Zhejiang. Made some keys from staking-deposit-cli, deposited 20hrs ago using the launchpad, with funds from faucet, beaconcha.in sees the deposit, but my CL client (teku) reports `Unable to retrieve status for 2 validators`. Perhaps I'm out of touch when it comes to depositing, how long things take, what the process is, but I wonder whether teku ought to be reporting some kind of change of state for validator so far? Also, maybe the Zhejiang config is different from other networks, but something feels off. Also, perhaps anecdotally, beaconcha.in took longer than usual to report Validators with newly deposited funds. That's what first set off my senses.",
