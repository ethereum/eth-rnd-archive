Also the Prysm command here mentions parameter `--interop-genesis-state`. I guess it must be `--genesis-state` in order to be consistent with the Geth-Prysm info (not sure what is the difference between the two). And I would kindly suggest to create some kind of \"merge-testing\"-channel in the Prysm discord to discuss Prysm merge specifics.",

I figure we’re not exchanging new status messages then so I wonder why would devp2p stop returning  after number 100 🤔",
