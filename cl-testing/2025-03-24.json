        "content": "Following up on this: from some initial modelling it looks like the cost of withdrawing and then re-depositing to force up the effective balance of a validator is not going to be worthwhile, as a rule.\n\nThe exception is for validators that a low balance (\u003c128 ETH), where it can take a long time to go from (e.g.) 129 ETH to 129.25 ETH, and using \"spare\" ETH that is either lying around or (more likely) comes from execution rewards can increase the APY.\n\nBut for anyone with large amounts of ETH they are better off consolidating then to ~500 ETH validators, and topping them up wiht execution rewards as they are obtained.\n\n(The modelling was pretty simple, and didn't take queue lengths into account so that it gave a \"best case\" result.  We're continuing to look at other strategies to see if anything may yield results that suggest that lots of withdrawing and topping up could be significantly beneficial.)",
