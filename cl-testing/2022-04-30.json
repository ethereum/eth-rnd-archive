It's been a little while since I've posted in this channel, because it seemed less noisy for me to report client errors more directly in their respective Discord channels.  Some client teams have a specific channel for merge or kiln while others don't.  At this point, I've shared some type of merge testing feedback with all client teams, so if any of it has gotten lost in the shuffle and/or there's a more preferred channel for me to post bug reports / logs / screenshots / etc. please ping me and let me know.  Also, while I think a quick screenshot and description might be sufficient in many situations, if it's helpful for me to create a GitHub issue for anything specific, let me know and I'd be happy to do so.",
