        "content": "While testing JWT auth on some CLs, my file mistakenly had a newline character added at the end. That caused the CLs to error out with `Invalid hex string: OddLength`. The fix was easy, to just strip the newline. But perhaps it would make sense for clients to strip EOL since I can imagine users running into this exact issue. \n\nAlso perhaps we can add to the spec if the JWT hex file needs a `0x` or not? I think most clients allow for both, but it would be nice to have it specified.",
