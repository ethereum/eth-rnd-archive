        "content": "Heads up: Shortly we'll be merging a change into Teku to update it to match the latest beacon chain spec which renamed the `MERGE` fork to `BELLATRIX`.  That means renaming a number of config items in the network definition files.  The kintsugi network definition hasn't yet been updated with those renames so if you're pointing teku at the kintsugi network definition from GitHub you'll find it fails to start when you update next.\n\nFortunately teku now has a Kintsugi network definition built in and we can keep that one working.  So you can now just run:\n```\nteku \\\n  --network kintsugi \\\n  --Xee-endpoint http://localhost:8545\n```\nand it will work both before and after we merge that rename PR.",

        "content": "Uhh I don't think i get your question exactly. \n\nSo for kintsugi, we embed the deposits into the genesis state (72100) of them to be exact. Assuming no one has made any deposits to the deposit contract, the kintsugi chain will only detect 72100 validators. \n\nNow some time has passed and we have ~100 new deposits registered in the deposit contract. \n\nSay you want to have your own chain with the same deposit contract (BUT different genesis fork version) - your chain would know nothing about the kintsugi 72100 \"embedded\" genesis validators. It would additionally deem the ~100 deposits it tracks on the deposit contract as invalid (since the genesis fork version doesn't match).",
