Kintsugi relies on an older spec and is using older versions of most clients and we believe most scenario's we want to test wouldn't make sense there. Devnet5 also runs older versions of clients and is smaller in general. We'd like to move to a shadow forking approach for scenario tests so that we can have a state + load as well (More shadow forking info coming tomorrow😉 )\n\nIf anyone has arguments to be made for keeping either testnet alive, do let us know and we can reconsider. \n\nIn the meantime, please migrate to the Kiln testnet.
