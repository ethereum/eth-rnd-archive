[note this is a new problem, today it is not possible to profitably cheat, because there is no way to profitably change the effective balance as maxeb == min activation balance]\n- consolidations seem to transfer effective balance. can there be extra ETH generated if the effective balance is larger than the current balance? e.g., after having missed attestations the balance may be lower than effective balance.\n- the request pre-queues in the EL, what happens if pools use consolidations similarly enthusiastic as the BLS to execution change on capella? will gas cost randomly go up to crazy levels while everyone tries to consolidate at the same time? will there be failed txes? do we _really_ want the pre-queue or should it be a flat fee but only limited by gas, same as deposits?\n- also related to request pre-queue: the 1559 mechanism has a bug with arithmetic vs geometric mean, so the target is not 50% but can be ~53%. are the new fee markets for pre-queues using the fixed blob formula or the bugged 1559?",
