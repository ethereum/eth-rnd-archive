As this is a key config flag (particularly for running several clients at once in a testnet) we thing it should be somehow standarized. These are the current flags:\n\nPrysm: --p2p-tcp-port --p2p-udp-port\nLighthouse: --port\nTeku: --p2p-port --p2p-udp-port\nNimbus: --tcp-port --udp-port\n\nGeth: --port\nNethermind: --port\nBesu: --p2p-port\n\nPersonally, I like the --port flag and think that all clients should include it.",
