Am I misremembering that as a feature or does it come closer to the TTD, or perhaps I'm scanning for the wrong message?  I confirmed here that the engine API traffic all looks correct: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/892088344438255616/1004883674342359133\n\nedit: just found via an internal thread that the ETA isn't displaying correctly due to the low TD delta per block in Clique.",
