        "content": "One thing that can be done is set up a well funded contract in Goerli and a version of the Goerli  launchpad that takes deposits and generates the transaction to that contract. Now this contract is whitelisted so only people that got Goerli from ethstaker can submit. The only difference from the real transaction will be that they send 0.1ETH instead of 32. The proxy contract funds the remaining 29.9 and sends the deposit to the actual contract. Now the ethstaker faucet can be less strict and give away very little money. One can argue that evil people can make a lot of deposits anyway but my understanding is that this is no change from the current status",

        "content": "Yeah I wouldn’t worry too much about people registering a heap of validators. It’s ok if the chain doesn’t finalise for a while (good testing and sepolia is the nice stable chain). Plus if it’s bad it will force us to implement and run through the social slashing scenario to remove the problematic validators. Exercising that is a pain in terms of coordination but good to do so we know exactly how it will work if we ever need it at short notice.",

        "content": "That's not a bad idea and we already have something similar where we have a bot do the deposit on behalf of the user, but it diverges from the *full* experience of staking. It prevents some problems (abuses, farming, etc) while it might create others (expectations, confusion, more support, delays, etc). Ideally, we want the experience of testing staking on Goerli to be as close as possible as what will happen on Mainnet to fully prepare stakers.",
