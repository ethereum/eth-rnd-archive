        "content": "I’m a blockchain developer with about six years of experience building real Web3 products, including smart contracts, DeFi systems, NFTs, and cross-chain features. I’ve built a yield-farming and staking platform on Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, where I fixed reward-manipulation issues using a checkpoint system and reduced gas costs by moving heavy calculations off-chain.\nI also created a cross-chain NFT marketplace on Polygon using IPFS, Next.js, and The Graph. To keep transfers consistent across chains, I built a lightweight relay that batches and verifies transactions—faster and cheaper than typical bridging setups.\nI’ve worked with DAO tools like OpenZeppelin, Gnosis Safe, and Snapshot, and I regularly integrate wallets like MetaMask and WalletConnect. I focus on writing secure, clean, and audit-ready Solidity code that works well in real deployments.\nIf you need a developer who can take your Web3 idea and turn it into something solid and reliable, I’d be happy to help.",
