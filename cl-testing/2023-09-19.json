If someone wrote a detailed, well-thought-out proposal (an EIP) and championed it, it might happen. AFAIK there's nobody working on that.\n\nYour best bet might be to slash yourself with another validator, which would get you back a small fraction of the reward (1/512th of the effective balance, in your case around 2 ETH), burn a bit (around 1 ETH/validator, or 30 ETH), and give the rest to the attacker. Or if you're feeling spiteful you could just stop validating and let the validators leak to 16 ETH so that the attacker doesn't get too much.",
