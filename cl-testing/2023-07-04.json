        "content": "the way I've always understood gossip clock disparity is that you accept messages based on what the oldest allowable/newest allowable slot would be with the tolerance. So in this case the minimum is `slot(previous_epoch.start_slot() - 500ms)` i.e. `previous_epoch.start_slot() - 1`. And the maximum is `slot(current_epoch.end_slot() + 500ms)` i.e. `current_epoch.end_slot() + 1`. This does seem a little strange",
