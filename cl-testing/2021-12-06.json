I forked the eth2-deposit-cli for it and created a new option for the --chain parameter for this devnet. I also wanted to fork the launchpad and run it locally with a custom environment template which you can easily define but ran into issue building it due to some errors around the sha3 dependencies. Maybe my nodejs version is incompatible.  In the end used ethabi-cli to create the hex data for the function call manually. Your approach seems easier.",
