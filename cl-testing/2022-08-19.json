I'm a bit hesistant to adopt it because I think a common case will be the block having 5-10% weight 500ms before, which would result in an fcU, which then rules out the option to re-org the block even if it _still_ has 5-10% weight by the time the next slot starts. So the threshold is essentially 5% rather than 10%.\n\nRecently there was some talk of the ELs adding a 500ms min build time to `getPayload` which would save our bacon even when we have fully suppressed the fcU and decide not to go through with the re-org",
