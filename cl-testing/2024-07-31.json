Same question for all the other states too. Is it somehow defined what states the validator must be in to be eligible for consolidation?\n- Can i consolidate a consolidated validator? i.e, add a 32 eth validator to a consolidated validator with 2015eth?\n- Can the custom celing be changed once set?\n- e.g: validator with 2048 ETH and churn limit of 8. Implies per epoch 8x32(256eth) can exit, so does this mean for 8 epochs no one else can exit? Or does the validator stall till the churn limit hits 64 and 1 epoch can accomodate its exit?\n\n(Thank you for the rationale section of the EIP, having all the changes in one place really helps think about edge cases that need testing)",
