        "content": "Right now FCU is defined for ELs to return status INVALID if the CL makes an FCU request for a hash that was previously marked as INVALID by newPayload. I think we should remove this requirement, at least if INVALID is due to block hash issue.\n\nThe reason being, it isn't clear how to store this information in EL. If we store the payload's blockHash field, that can be set arbitrarily and I think this could possibly be exploited. If we store the calculated value, it is a bit better, but it might be possible to send a previous known valid payload and modify the blockHash so it _looks_ invalid. Still weird.",

We can however require that the CL never sends an FCU for a hash to which it has explicitly received an invalid status. I think this frees the EL from this obligation and any CL that sends an FCU for a block it has already sent new Payload and got invalid it's already doing something bad anyway",
