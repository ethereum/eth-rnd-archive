        "content": "Is it expected that the `safe` block lags behind `latest` quite a bit on both Goerli and Sepolia?  For example on Sepolia:\n\n```\n\u003e eth.getBlockByNumber(\"latest\", false).number - eth.getBlockByNumber(\"safe\", false).number\n42\n\u003e eth.getBlockByNumber(\"latest\", false).number - eth.getBlockByNumber(\"safe\", false).number\n42\n\u003e eth.getBlockByNumber(\"latest\", false).number - eth.getBlockByNumber(\"safe\", false).number\n44\n```\n\nMy rough understanding was the `safe` should only lag behind latest by 4s or so?  Is this due to low participation or finality issues?",

The work on that is being in progress\n\nI (and perhaps many others) thought this was already implemented.",
