        "content": "What if the order of operation was changed, would this work instead?\n\n- I tell a \"staking faucet\" on Goerli that I want to stake w/ a new public key K\n- That faucet deposits say 31.99 Eth on behalf of my public key K\n- I now go through the normal flow for setting up a validator on goerli, but only need to include 0.1 Eth in my signed deposit\n\nActually, maybe better, the \"staking faucet\" consumes the same `deposit_data-*.json` files, so the flow is something like:\n\n- User runs `deposit new-mnemonic --chain=goerli --num_validators=1 --use-staking-faucet=31.99` (the new `use-staking-faucet` option basically tells the deposit CLI to change the `amount`field in the deposit_data file to `REQUIRED_AMOUNT - $use_staking_faucet_argument` so in this case `amount` would be `10000000` since we are asking the faucet to cover 31.99 for us)\n- User then uploads `deposit_data-*.json` to the new \"staking faucet\" which in turn deposits the amount necessary on behalf of the user\n- The user then completes the normal launchpad flow, signing a tx to deposit `0.1` GoEth\n\nObviously this flow requires a new faucet and some changes to the deposit tool(s) but doesn't require any on-chain changes and just adds a step in the launchpad vs fundamentally changing the flow between mainnet and goerli.",
