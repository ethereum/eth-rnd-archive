        "content": "I have a beacon/validator (prysm, lighthouse, teku, nimbus) running, the beacon is using a bootnode to find peers and is peered successfully to other clients on the custom network. Am curious to know the recovery mode of a beacon when I kill/stop all existing connections using a tool like conntrack in linux. Does the beacon know how to recover from that, i.e detect that TCP peering connection has been killed and reconnect again.\n\nContext: Am running a custom testnet and doing some network issues tests. Example placing a firewall to block peering port and stopping all existing connections, then the validator is unable to finalize without peers. After a while, am removing the firewall and observing the beacon/validator. Noted its still not able to finalize even when given enough time, but when I restart them, they detect peering is possible now without firewall and finalize correctly. This happens for all client types.\nQuestion: Should it not be able to recover without a restart?",
