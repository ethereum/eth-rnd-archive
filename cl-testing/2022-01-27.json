My suggestion would be to just have a big one before the merge. This will lead to the best test possible for the merge to ensure there are no bugs (most participants), will greatly increase confidence for the merge, and will also best help prepare people for the merge/advertise it. Also your going to have a lot of support requests on the R\u0026D channel whenever there is a large public testnet so not having multiple will likely save some headache.",
