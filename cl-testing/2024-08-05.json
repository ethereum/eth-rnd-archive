        "content": "- custom ceilings isn't currently in spec\n - entry / exit is based on balance change now\n\nI guess concretely, 256 eth is `MAX_PER_EPOCH_ACTIVATION_EXIT_CHURN_LIMIT`, and `MIN_PER_EPOCH_CHURN_LIMIT_ELECTRA` is 128 eth, so it really depends on network conditions, but for arguments sake lets say effectively like the 8 per epoch limit thats there now is the intent. \nThis does mean that a 2048 eth validator is going to be the  only exit 8 epochs basically, so it'd be this 1 validator exiting, then a gap, then the next one. the `earliest_exit_epoch` on the state would be updated...\nThis is all new - we should really poke at it - test a large validator exiting but also test like 1000 32 eth validators exiting and see how it comes out, make sure theres no crazy gaps...\nLarge partial withdrawals should also have an impact, so one test might be a 2048 eth validator withdrawing 2016 eth and seeing that the exits don't continue without being affected.... or doing a large deposit and seeing that onboarding slows down, but thats probably less easy... because earliest_exit_epoch is on state, we should be able to see large deposits changing that value without actually having validators exit really...",
