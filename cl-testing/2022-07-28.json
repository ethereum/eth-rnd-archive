Regardless it doesn't _appear_ to be Merge related so this channel might not be appropriate location to discuss.",

        "content": "Has anyone else noticed that recently goerli is having a _lot_ of 1 block reorgs?  Anecdotally, looking at my logs, seems like almost _every_ block is being imported 3 different times, (this is from a non-signer regular geth 1.10.21 node):\n\n```\nINFO [07-28|14:13:02.361] Imported new chain segment               blocks=1   txs=1    mgas=0.021   elapsed=1.031ms     mgasps=20.368   number=7,305,656 hash=842afe..668ff0 dirty=0.00B\nINFO [07-28|14:13:02.897] Imported new chain segment               blocks=1   txs=21   mgas=5.514   elapsed=33.166ms    mgasps=166.242  number=7,305,656 hash=23efae..cbd454 dirty=0.00B\nINFO [07-28|14:13:03.179] Imported new chain segment               blocks=1   txs=20   mgas=5.493   elapsed=30.399ms    mgasps=180.682  number=7,305,656 hash=85bb0b..58f945 dirty=0.00B\n```\n\nI'm assuming this is an issue w/ one or more of the Clique validators? Ours looks fine, but for example I can see that our validator tried and failed to mine the above block multiple times, presumably because one or more of the others were offline, logs here: https://gist.github.com/ryanschneider/124fb99b9d97190db106fc00d775ce53\n\nAnyways, the main reason I bring this all up here is I've no idea if this will make the merge transition more difficult, or where the best place is to get in touch w/ the other Goerli Clique signers these days.",
