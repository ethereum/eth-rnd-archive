The spec doesn't say anything about this ancestor of the head of the canonical chain, it could be more specific by saying that *if an ancestor is `VALID`* (assuming full validation) the update may be skipped.\n\nThis would be enough to rely on the invariant that CL never sends an fcU if a beacon block enveloping the head is invalid. Thus CL will either extend the canonical chain or switch a fork by the subsequent fcU calls.",
