        "content": "I've been thinking a bit about the hive module for CL clients. \nAll issues with it stem from the unidirectionality of the overall design.\nIt is very easy to write test cases for the EL, since we can just mock the messages coming from CL and tell the EL what to do.\nWe can also very easily query the state of the EL to check in which state it is.\nMy idea for the CL hive tester is to write a proxy (similar to what prysm uses) to introduce faults in the communication between EL and CL.\nThis has the drawback that we need to wait for the CL to initiate all actions and based on the action decide whether we want to introduce a fault or not.\nFor the CL to initiate these actions, we would need to set up a functioning network, s.th. we could screw with one of the nodes.\nWe might even want to mock out the network traffic to the CL (but that would be incredibly difficult and lots of work).\nAnother open question for me is how to check in which state the CL is. We can probably use the rest api to get the current slot etc?!\nAnyway, I'll start building the proxy and a couple of test cases as a start and figure the rest of the stuff out as we go",
