There seems to be little appetite from devs to support another testnet and this would require additional automation to do the scheduled build and tear down",

No need to update or change the launchpad, staking-deposit-cli or clients much (besides the `EJECTION_BALANCE` network config on clients). *Nothing at stake* would still remain an issue which does not seem to have any easy solution.",

I'm guessing some kind of Goerli fork would be coordinated in time if it were to happen now. Maybe that solution would be good enough as well for a Goerli network that has a very large GoETH supply.",
