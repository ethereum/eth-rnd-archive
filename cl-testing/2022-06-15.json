I think it is not correct.\n\nThe part of the spec that is tested states:\n\u003e Client software MUST ensure that payloadAttributes.timestamp is greater than timestamp of a block referenced by forkchoiceState.headBlockHash. If this condition isn't held client software MUST respond with -38003: Invalid payload attributes and MUST NOT begin a payload build process. In such an event, the forkchoiceState update MUST NOT be rolled back.\n\nMy doubt is about the last part:\n\n\u003e forkchoiceState update MUST NOT be rolled back.\n\nSo even though we return an error we have to apply the forkchoice update, meaning updating  headBlockHash and finalizedBlockHash, to the new values that were sent by the request. In the test it seems we don't have to apply this update and only should return the error.",
