Some clients are functional on the main fork (Prysm, Lodestar etc).\n- There is a proposal to launch the next devnet with only supernodes as an immediate step. For now, teams will continue to debug the current devnet for another 1-2 weeks. \n- Issue raised regarding KZG verification time during sync (Prysm) and batching the verification seems to significantly improve this.\n- Client teams to review Katya's DAS metrics PR and provide feedback\n\nVideo will be uploaded later when  \u003c@415109946682769408\u003e is back 🙏",
