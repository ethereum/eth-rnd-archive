        "content": "Hi everyone,\nI had a DAS related presentation titled “Data Availability Sampling from the Networking Perspective” in EthereumZurich.\nI hope you don’t mind if I share it here. It is:\n-  a generic intro (still not everyone outside of this group knows DAS 🙂 ), including the DAS block encoding structure, the data pipeline, etc.\n-  some networking considerations, especially around reliability mechanisms in the distribution of samples to validators\n- an intro to the simulator that we are building. Still very much WIP, but contributions are already welcome\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-xkP4FzYMQ",
