KYC \n3. web of trust\n4. human presence based\n\neach of these has their own tradeoffs (i agree with that the privacy concerns related to KYC/bio etric are really high, so i somewhat prefer web of trust personally, but thats kind of why passport is pluralistic, deriving its sybil resistence from multiple diff mechanism)\n\ni did a podcast episode with professor bryan ford who has been working on sybil resistence for ~15-20 years, and thats where im sourcing my info from ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlDOjDu-mpU )",
