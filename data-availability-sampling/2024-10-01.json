As I briefly mentioned in today's PeerDAS breakout, \u003c@1010280066028142662\u003e and I recently started to work on improving PeerDAS R\u0026D transparency and communication.\n\nWe put some ideas in this doc: https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/das-acc\nIncluding:\n1. Creating a (Peer)DAS Contributor List to enhance collaboration channels and improve transparency across teams.\n2. Preparing a PeerDAS Resource Collection and FAQs to provide educational resources for the community.\n\nHopefully, it will help strengthen PeerDAS readiness and focus efforts on delivering PeerDAS. 🫶 \n\n**[ACTION REQUEST] To the generate the (Peer)DAS contributor list, please help fill in this form: https://forms.gle/tt1L2QvSq3JnKPoW7**\n\nThank you for your time!",
