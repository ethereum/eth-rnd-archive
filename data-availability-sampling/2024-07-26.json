Perhaps a naive and crazy idea, but I'm curious to see how much work it is to do this from the beginning vs having to take care of the transition from 1D to 2D PeerDAS. I think it might be a bit messy having to have the code for both 1D and 2D for a period of time, and also having to touch every part of peerdas code again (reconstruction, validator custody, custody groups) when we get there - we'll essentially need to maintain both 1D and 2D logic in every part of the PeerDAS code.",
