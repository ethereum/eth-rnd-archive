This would also allow us to test peer selection using the advertised ENR `custody_subnet_count` field (i.e. there exists some regular nodes that only custody min requirements) (re @nashatyrev_a: Does it make sense to set CUSTODY_REQUIREMENT = 64 for the initial milestones to abstract over discovering/peering difficulties (with this value all peers are equally subscribe/custody all the columns)?)",
