        "content": "Thanks for getting back to me Justin, yeah those changes are the kind of things that I'd like to see. I Don't follow the peer das spec to know where else it appears and surely clients will have their own separate signatures on implementations. I would just ask to err on the safe side and take the commitments as you did there (and if it appears somewhere else). This will at least make my life easier when I need to rebase 7732 on top of peer DAS. Otherwise you'll have me pushing to ship both together 😝",
