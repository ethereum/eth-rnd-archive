We can keep the publicly computable custody, with a value chosen to provide a backbone of long-lived subscriptions for the subnets and enough \"data density\" for peer sampling. What we don't need is extra public custody for the purpose of pre-sampling guarantees. Since it is only useful for voting, we can make this extra-custody be per-validator",

I suppose some client teams already have it from the client end?\n\nM5, we proposed a simplified version of `is_data_available`. It would be determined by “if I can download all my custody columns”. We should talk more about it onsite, but for now, we try to focus on sampling and interoperability.\n\nLet me know if it make sense to you or not!",
