        "content": "Why will there be a premium for Ethereum DA versus altDA options (EigenDA, Celestia, Near and even AWS)? The main advantage I can see is it requires less security assumptions when both L2 proofs and DA are posted to the same L1. Beyond this quality of DA argument, are there any specific and concrete UX/UI or functionality advantages for L2s and their users if a rollup uses L1 DA versus alt-DA? Any additional functionality in cross-L2 composability and bridging, or anything else, which is not available to L2s that use alt-DA?",
