I read this document https://hackmd.io/@fradamt/blob-tickets I get that this works for 1D extended blobs, but I was wondering what happens in the case of 2D extended blobs. A guy who sends a blob tx can extend his blob horizontally before posting it on the mempool, because he knows his blob, but who is going to be responsible for extending the multiple blobs vertically? Is the L1 builder going to extend all columns vertically? Or is it gonna be a more of a distributed approach where each column subnet is responsible for extending the column vertically on their own? or is this an open question?  \u003c@555483069038198827\u003e \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e",
