        "content": "Regarding the question of \"what if nodes change their address and thus custody allocation on a restart\", we made some back of the envelope calculations. Here they are:\n\nTotal **amount of data per column in custody**:\n     18 days * slots/day * avg(blobs/slot) *  columnsize = 18 * 7200 * 3 * (128KB / 64) = 777,600 ~= **0.75 GB**\n\nAt minimum custody, this means\n        Full node: 0.75 GB * 4 = 3 GB\n        Validator node: 0.75 GB * 6 = 4.5 GB\n\nAverage number of **intersecting columns **after new assignment:\n      approx. 4/128 * 4 = **0.125 columns** , which means 0.75 GB * 0.125 ~= 90 MB\n\n  - Serving data: Intersecting columns become part of the topic mesh, but it would need external trigger to be pushed because default gossipsub time window is much smaller. \n\n  - Probability distribution of intersecting columns (how many nodes will be seeding a given column after a full reshuffle)\n    TBD\n\n**Non-intersecting columns**: 3 GB - 90 MB … is still almost 3 GB 🙂\n\n- This is both the amount of data a **node should download** to backfill, and the **amount of data it could serve if we make it possible**\n\n- Serving data: Custody data is not lost, non-intersecting columns are still there, but in nodes that are not anymore subscribed to those columns.\n\n- Should these nodes advertise this, and if so, how?\n  - Gossip IHAVEs (on heartbeat or expedited) are limited to much smaller time window by default.\n  - if we advertise it explicitly, we basically nullify the \"privacy advantage\" of changing the peer ID",
