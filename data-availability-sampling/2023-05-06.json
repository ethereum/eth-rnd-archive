        "content": "this is a nice approach to topology aware routing, makes solving k-disjoint path problem in the graph much more effective. nothing says, in section II. B.3., that the weighted graph of the network that is put together and distributed, has to reveal all ip addresses. if there is a good way to share it without sharing ip addresses of all nodes in the network, then this is a resilient approach. sharing all ip addresses of all nodes in one collection makes it easy for ISPs to block all traffic from the whole network at once without the delay of running discovery. when distributing the weighted graph of the network, it will come in a message from some source ip and it doesn't have to be labeled with ip addresses since all a node needs to know in order to do topology aware routing is the topology relative to the 1-st hop which is that source ip https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9813897",
