        "content": "The question to other CL teams. \nWe found an issue in our implementation on RPC negotiation. We don't have mechanism to dynamically add v2 Status support. So as far as FULU is scheduled we register both v1 and v2 and when 2 nodes with v2 meet each other, they choose v2 for exchange even if both are in Electra. \nWe could probably fix it one day, but looks like it's deep in libp2p implementation we never had active handlers registration. We always register everything at startup.\nDoes anyone have similar issue?",
