If you're curious to learn more join us on our Discord or DM me your questions.\n\nWe set out to design a key management device resistant to intrusion attempts from sophisticated state level-actors. An LDS anti-tamper mesh tripwire is meant to prevent these physical attacks and provide PCI security standard compliance.\n\nThe entire secure environment is encased in this mesh and draws your screen to prevent physical person-in-the-middle attack vectors and because your hardware security is only as good as your ability to verify what you're signing using a securely drawn screen. Your keys are isolated from the outside world in this mesh - signatures and signature requests are passed back and forth between the general environment and the HSM via a muxed FRAM mailbox. This is to offset the security risks of using USB or Bluetooth and is closer to an airgapped solution.\n\nThis means no remote contact with the HSM, risk of supply chain attacks is greatly diminished, there's no accessible factory or engineering debug features, and the fixed FRAM mailbox size eliminates overflow attacks.\n\nAnd yes, you can use Yubikey HSM2s for the purposes mentioned - we use them as a tool internally for a few things. I'd say the Lattice1 is a very unique HW device at the moment and is a superset of that device's programmability, the basic functionality of the BTC wallets discussed above, along with a whole lot more that I would not be able to cover here before I got booted from the R\u0026D server where I usually just lurk.  😅",
