        "content": "In elliptic curve cryptography, I understand that K (public Key) = k (private Key) * G. However, whenever people show finding points on an elliptic curve, they draw a two points A and B to find C and they reflect it across the x axis to get the point C' (read C prime).\n\nI am a bit confused by what k * G means. In ECC, we can have a Generator point and we can have an end point, but depending on what the second point is, our answer for k will be different. Where is the second point in that equation? Or is the mystery of this second point why ECC is more complicated for a given set of numbers? Because it is kind of like having nested loops - there is an inner loop trying to find the value of n for a given second point, and an outer loop trying different second points? But that means that this is not exactly a \"trapdoor\" function since we need information outside of k and G to find K (the second point).",
