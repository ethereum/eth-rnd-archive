If I understood correctly, EIP-1153 is currently in the process of being peer-reviewed. However, is it possible to tell how likely it is that it will be accepted? Is it practically a matter of time, is it still very unclear, is it unlikely? Can one make assumptions about that at all?\n2. Are there versions/distributions of the solidity compiler that already supports transient storage?\nThanks in advance for anyone that can help!",
