And Vitalik appearing with some TV celebrity?\n\ni think you overestimate how many people watch the call live 🙃  and how much new information is produced as a result. it's mostly confirming async discussions that have already taken place. not sure about the vitalik thing, but my gut also says probably nothing significant there",
