        "content": "Hey guys, so a friend of mine raised a query about the implications of stable coins, if and when ETH chain ia forked by say CIRCLE (which issues usdc), since circle is under control of regulators, they can launch a forked ETH, declare usdc tokens on eth chain are not redeemable but are redeemable on the forked chain. With this forked chain, they can comply with all regulatory requirements and modify the codes and setup their own initial nodes. Now the DeFi protocols have no choice but to go with CIRCLE's backed forked ETH Chain. Seeing defi development on forked ETH of circle, miners/stakers will gradually shift to fETH chain. This basically opens up a centralisation problem all over again.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks. :)",
