        "content": "\u003c@!203220829473996800\u003e It makes sense a miner can add/remove things from the list ( implement their own miner_selects_highest_fee_transactions() in the example), but if at some later point they are forced to generate a proof_of_shuffling against included transactions, that should inhibit some forms of manipulation. In the example coded above, a miner is still free to use whatever transaction selection process they want (e.g. a method that accepts lower-fee transactions with fees paid to the miner separately). In that case, the bribed transaction gets included in the block, but its internal order is still randomized.  If I understand correctly, you're suggesting there is no point in the block creation process at which a block producer could be forced to finalize a selection of which transactions to include before determining the internal order of those transactions.",

Also, users can spam transactions to increase the odds that their transaction will come before some target transaction which is really unhealthy for the network.",
