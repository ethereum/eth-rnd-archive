We just shared a paper on Hop, a protocol that lets you trustlessly transfer tokens directly from one rollup to another rollup. Hop also enables fast exits from rollups to Ethereum.\n\nhttps://ethresear.ch/t/hop-send-tokens-across-rollups/8581\n\nWould really appreciate any and all feedback on the design.\nCheckout the demo here: https://hop.exchange",
