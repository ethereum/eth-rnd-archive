Mining is a basic introduction to blockchain technology for many. Having a small pow side chain is not a bad idea \u003c@636289909359116290\u003e",

        "content": "There is value in GPU/CPU PoW mining as it creates an incredibly censorship resistant on-ramp, where you can take fiat, buy mundane goods and electricity, and receive ETH.  I don't think being a useful thing alone is enough to significantly complicate the protocol though.  Luckily, there do exist other chains that support CPU/GPU mining.  The missing piece to the puzzle here is the ability to transfer assets from one chain to another in a censorship resistant and trustless/permissionless way.",

As Micah says, there are chains where people can mine with a GPU. Cross-chain movement of assets is something I’m quite interested in and hope to be a part of.",
