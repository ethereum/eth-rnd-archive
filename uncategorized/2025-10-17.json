To go from the EF to a corpo stablecoin chain is just sad. Tempo just another centralized corpo stablecoin altL1 that cosplaying decentralization with lots of VC backing and KoLs shilling. I really don't like the rationalization Tempo somehow shares Ethereum's value.\nMy theory is Tempo has a TGE coming up and needed to buy some legitimacy to pump their token price by purchasing a token EF big name researcher to trot around like a show pony and post what they tell him to on his CT. That will be Dankrad's primary contribution to Tempo.",
