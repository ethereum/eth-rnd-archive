DC and I propose a middle ground and a progressive path towards precomile: Make it a non-precompile first, and then when widely adopted, move to petition it as precompile. \n\nWe like to seek your feedback on this idea:  https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/progressive-precompiles-via-create2-shadowing/14821",
