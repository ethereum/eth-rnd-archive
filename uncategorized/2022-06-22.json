        "content": "The first sentence is false. Indeed PoS is more complex, a **lot more**. As such, surely has more attack vectors on the consensus protocol than pure PoW. It has a few other drawbacks too: it more than doubled the number of people required to be involved when/how to ship upgrades (at least for the first couple of them that need to touch both execution and consensus layers), it increases a bit the required number of blocks to wait before considering your transaction *safe*, it requires users to run two pieces of software if they want to follow the chain without trusting anyone else, with all the configuration issues and risks that that in itself opens, just to name a few. We would be out of our minds if we would be switching to PoS if it was only as a pure brain masturbation. The fact is that PoS has a couple of huge advantage over PoW, not the least of them being **accountability**. It may be easier in PoS to try to fork a few blocks here and then, but do it often and we **will know** who you are and we will be able to come back and punish you for doing so.",
