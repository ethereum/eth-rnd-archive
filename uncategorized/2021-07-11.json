Crypto provides more transparencies into the modes of breakdown, which in turn can be used to design better and remove these in the first place. Transparency also promotes knowing what the breakdown modes and likelihoods of occuring are in the first place, even if they cannot be removed. This is more beneficial than say a judicial system (how much does it cost to DDOS a court with meaningless cases? How far do social incentives need to be engineered to bribe a court? Nobody knows)\n\n\nIf you can clearly define who the trusted actors are and what degree of trust you're placing, you also have the side benefit of sometimes being able to make it non-privileged (for instance once you realise incentives and trust for a single block producer you can rotate it using PoW or PoS). But idk if this is a the primary goal.",
