        "content": "Hi guys, \nfrom my understanding the default transaction ordering mechanism in Geth is simply ordering by transaction nonce and execute transactions in that order producing a set of intermediate state roots and a post root at the end. \n\nHowever, updating the merkle tree like so seems to be time consuming. \n\n\nMy question come in two folds: \n\n1. without considering extracting maximal value, has there been any research into ways to improve efficiency in merkle tree updates in terms of transactions ordering? \n2. Do we really need intermediate state roots?\n\nMy idea with regards to question 1 is that instead of recalculating the tree root multiple times for each transaction, why not just update the leafs all at once and calculate a post root at the end?",
