I'm very curious by this comment of yours\n\u003e if we get rid of Ropsten, Rinkeby and Goerli, execution implementations can delete the botched Constantinople fork code\n\nWhat is this code and why does it get to be deleted if we stop supporting those networks? The only wild guess I can make is that those testnets were probably forked before the bug was found and are probably still vulnerable?",

So they're no longer vulnerable and are in sync with mainnet specs, but to sync the historical chain you need this one extra fork that never deployed to mainnet.",
