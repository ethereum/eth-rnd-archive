        "content": "To sum my argument why I think a big (at least to 100M) gas limit increase is necessary:\n- state only becomes a real issue after a year+, but evm rollups are supposed to arrive during summer (may be delayed). High l1 throughput is only necessary until rollups become a real alternative. Gas limit can be reduced after that (maybe just by increasing the gas cost of state increasing opcodes).\n- in the short to medium term, increasing gas limit a lot increases node decentralization as node owners are a subset of ethereum users. Fees for ~3 uniswap swaps buy a 4TB SSD (Samsung 870). Fees would have to drop by two orders of magnitudes before regular ethereum users that would want to have a node won't because of resource demands.\n- right now ethereum is losing dominance every day. Many devs genuinely can't even afford to deploy contracts on ethereum - deploying a contract can cost more than average monthly wage in most of the world.\nThere's a non-zero probability that network effects of centralized competitors, in particular BSC, become dominant to the point that even after rollups arrive, they don't catch on.\nThis means a dystopian future in which centralized blockchains dominate for a short while, but then they are trivially neutralized by regulations and everything is forced to move to government-run blockchains.\nAt that point, decentralized blockchains just won't be allowed to proliferate, closing the window of opportunity forever.\nI think dealing with larger state size is a much better version of the future.\n\nWith snapshot sync, syncing won't be a problem even with a much higher gas limit. At 100M/block one block should take close to 1 sec to validate on an average laptop/pc (geth with snapshot).",
