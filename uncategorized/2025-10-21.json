We just released a Merkle tree crate in Rust, fixed depth, incremental only and optimized for fast proof generation.\n\nYou can plug any store/hash you want. Now supports memory, sqlite, rocksdb, sled and keccak/poseidon. Easy to extend with more. Super simple interface that you can implement in no time without dealing with the tree specifics.\n\nQuite useful to index events from contracts such as the ethereum deposit or agglayer bridge exits.\n\nOpen for contributions.\n\nhttps://github.com/bilinearlabs/rs-merkle-tree",
