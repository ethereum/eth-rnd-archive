I don' t have any hashes right now but can look tomorrow (dead tired here today). But just to be sure: you guys keep the attestations for these blocks? or just the blocks. What I am trying to find out is if there are pools that are attesting blindly to invalid blocks. Altough it may be hard: if I went above and beyond to run without an EL, I would also only attest to blocks that others are already attesting.",

There's a bit of a discoverability issue with mapping invalid execution block hashes back to beacon block hashes, but we can capture more data to help with that. Will be rolled out tomorrow.\n\n1. A `Block Finder` dashboard: https://grafana.observability.ethpandaops.io/goto/Leuz7tCIg?orgId=1\n which acts as a link to the `Who Attested To This` dashboard with the correct beacon block root \u0026 time range.\n\n2. A `Who Attested To This` dashboard:\nhttps://grafana.observability.ethpandaops.io/goto/jYIvntCIR?orgId=1\n- requires a beacon block root, network and time range\n- shows which validator indexes attested to that block root, can be downloaded in csv/json\n- uses \u003c@602753420033785856\u003e's blockprint data to take an educated guess at which CL's are attesting (will be useful in case a CL starts accepting invalid blocks?)\n- might be able to wire up entity data too\n\nIf you need credentials reset for our Grafana just ping me (same goes for any other core dev!)",
