Get rid of \u003c#798403407076917269\u003e  last message is from April, so either a different forum with less interaction would work (magicians or research) or just merge in general.  Same for the networking related channels like \u003c#646778960830660623\u003e \u003c#595701087499976854\u003e \u003c#682024484689149955\u003e \u003c#710831784991916072\u003e  can be safely merged without anyone being spammed by the move or losing messages.

In the three main sections (general / Execution / Consensus) but just stick to consensus which I'm more comfortable (and mostly because those I follow 🙂 ). By the way, I think it would be better to have only three main setions instead of the current 5: it doesn't make sense to have a main board named Consensus R\u0026D when the whole server is supposed to be R\u0026D. I'd just stick to General/Execution/Consensus, although I understand that there's no consensus on the word \"Consensus\"",
