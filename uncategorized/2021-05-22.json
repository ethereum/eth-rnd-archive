I'm don't expect this simple solution to actually solve MEV, but am interested in learning whether it may be a step in the right direction \u0026 if not, where its issues are.  Didn't see an MEV channel so I hope it's alright to share this here - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19iWrLdnVddjaoECUHi2MuiGlMFXBpcsH -- appreciate any feedback.",
