Thank you again for your past reviews.\n\nI have just applied for a Protocol Tester position (Consensus). I’m focused on deterministic CL testing and have opened a consensus-specs PR (#4594) to improve `randomize_state`, so that fork-transition tests catch missing copy mistakes. I also wrote a short note on how I structure reproducible PySpec tests (time via process_slots, seeded randomness, SSZ assertions).\n\nIf appropriate, could you route this to the CL Testing lead or point me to them. I'd be happy to do a 15-minute technical chat on the invariants I’d add in week one.\n– PR: [4594](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4594)\n– [Note](https://medium.com/@richardgrecoson/designing-deterministic-consensus-layer-tests-6dca8ff5a3c2)\n– [GitHub](https://github.com/richardgreg)\n\ncc \u003c@892053833121923094\u003e",
