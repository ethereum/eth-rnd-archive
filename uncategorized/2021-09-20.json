Under the assumption that \u003chttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainsafe/lodestar-light-client\u003e or any other Altair-conforming light client is ready by the merge. What would be a mechanism to censor such clients? The only way I can see this happening is if said client cannot find a single validator to sync from it with honest packets. So unless I am missing a point here, with the assumptions that \n1. Those clients (and not something more robust like the portal network)  are ready by the merge\n2. There is a single peer that is reachable and serves sync committee aggregates\nThen a user can trustlessly access the beacon-chain.  Therefore bringing back my point that under those 2 assumptions that are quite mild, we can set the block gas limit with the validator's hardware in mind and not the user. \nIf your point is that 1) above is not ready and we should discuss when that happens, then we are in complete agreement. If on the other hand the point is that Altair's light clients are not censorship resistant, then I'd like to understand this argument to think about this problem.",

Wei in Ethereum. \nInstead of having a wallet full of currency that has no direct association with the owner, the coins in your wallet would have your own ‘identifier’ embedded, this would be akin to writing your own name on every banknote and coin in your wallet, if you transfer or spend coins then they would then be re-identified to the seller/person’s ‘identifier’.\nOnly you can authorize the re-identification of ownership in any transaction thus making any theft pointless due to the coin needing the correct identification for future trades, this would have parallels to stealing a cell phone that incorporates a very strong password which hopefully the thief cannot break into and which renders the item a valueless ornament. \nWouldn’t this also allow for a more trusted trade? You can send coins but only when re-identification is complete would the coins ‘identifier’ ownership be changed and no longer yours.\nThe same with exchanges or schemes where cryptocurrencies are pooled, the coins would be available to trade but still tied to you through your ‘identifier’, this would surely prevent large scale theft by unscrupulous businesses because the only real outcome would be a wallet full of unusable coins.\nAre there any glaringly obvious reasons why this couldn’t work?",
