        "content": "hi everyone! I'm trying to get the gist of sharding and understand the suggested rollup architecture after the sharding phase. Some questions I have so far:\n\n1. Where exactly does EVM execution happen after sharding is introduced? Looking here https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/sharding_proposal it seems that a shard block is just a data blob.\n2. It's probably dependent on my previous question, but what shard information do I have available when executing txs. IIUC the beacon block has the headers of all shard blocks, but I'm not sure what this means for execution",
