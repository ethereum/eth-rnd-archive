Strong would be ideal but fuzzy is acceptable.\n* We could have sorted sets as the input, yes.\n* We don't need to update the data structure. Once the set is finalized we can compute this hypothetical structure and pass it around. Since it'd be going over the network at a 1-1 correspondence with transactions (althogh packaged in blocks) it would have to be very space efficient.\n\nSo we're looking for a no-update, space-efficient, comparision-efficient, possible fuzzy, structure.",
