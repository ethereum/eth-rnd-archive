According to the specification for [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702), there is a new transaction type that follows [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) but according to that EIP, the `TransactionPayload` is supposed to be an `opaque byte array`. There is even a whole section why it is preferred to be an `opaq byte array` instead of `rlp` encoding and then in the EIP-7702 the `TransactionPayload` is actually `rlp` encoding. Is there a discrepancy here? Can we say that EIP-7702 is not compliant with EIP-2718? What am I missing?",
