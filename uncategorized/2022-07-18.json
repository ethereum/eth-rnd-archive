        "content": "江卓尔：以太坊主网合并在11月-12月进行的概率很大]7月17日消息，江卓尔表示，ETH开发人员计划9月19日合并ETH2.0，但这种大型软件开发项目，最后延期也是常态，并且还有大量的ETH应用项目没有开始测试，因此料敌从宽，再加2-3个月冗余（这也是难度炸弹延长区块时间的最后可忍受时间），11-12月合并的概率很大，正好契合年底熊市下跌结束的惯例（2014、2018熊市都是到年底止跌），由ETH作为龙头，启动下一轮牛市。ETH2.0后的三大实际资金面利好：1.ETH将减产90%，你想想一次BTC减半都会带来一轮大牛市，而减产90%=3次BTC减半。2.POS锁定币预计从现在的10%提高到30%（按照其它POS币惯例），更多币被锁定。3.再加上EIP-1559烧币，实际通胀从正2.0%变负1.8%，开启币圈前所未有的燃烧通缩时代。\n(Google translate below)\n\n🗨️ GTranslate\nJiang Zhuoer: There is a high probability that the Ethereum mainnet merger will be carried out from November to December] In the news on July 17, Jiang Zhuoer said that ETH developers plan to merge ETH2.0 on September 19, but this large-scale software development Projects, the final delay is also the norm, and there are still a large number of ETH application projects that have not started testing, so it is expected that the enemy will be lenient, plus 2-3 months of redundancy (this is also the last tolerable time for the difficulty bomb to extend the block time), The probability of a merger between November and December is very high, which is in line with the convention that the bear market decline ends at the end of the year (the bear market in 2014 and 2018 will stop falling at the end of the year), with ETH as the leader to start the next round of bull market. The three actual capital aspects after ETH2.0 are positive: 1. ETH will reduce production by 90%. You think that a BTC halving will bring a big bull market, and a 90% production reduction = 3 BTC halvings. 2. The POS locked currency is expected to increase from the current 10% to 30% (according to other POS currency conventions), and more coins will be locked. 3. Coupled with the EIP-1559 burning of coins, the actual inflation has changed from positive 2.0% to negative 1.8%, opening an unprecedented era of burning deflation in the currency circle.",
