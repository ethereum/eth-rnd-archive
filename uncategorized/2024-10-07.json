Could be useful for EIP analysis and research. \n\n**Idea**: Translate EIP data into semantic triples to allow enhanced querying of all things EIP.\n**Project**: Set up a prototypic SPARQL endpoint with data from the EIP Github Repo \u0026 created Instructions for how to query this data.\n**Feedback** via the survey link (anonymous Lime survey or any other reply) would be highly appreciated!!!!\n\nAll info's can be found on my GH website: \nitsnilskerwer.github.io\nOr via the repo \"eip-rdf\" on my profile.\n\nBest Nils ❤️ happy to meet everyone!\n\n(Disclaimer: Sorry if this is the wrong place to post. Reddit, ethereum research/ magicians do not let me post due to \"new acc\" restrictions. The intro channel seems to be for portfolios mainly ^^ If you could direct me somewhere more appropriate that would be appreciated.)",
