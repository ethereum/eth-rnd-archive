If so, will it affect directly this server? https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out\nAt any rate it is probably a sign that we should think on moving this server elsewhere in the future. Probably a good way of also encouraging to move some of the many private TG channels to the same venue",

The \"right\" solution would be to move to a federated, self hosted, or peer to peer chat platform but the UX for all of them is notable worse than Discord (though still better than Telegram).",
