I have built a few contracts and worked around a simple web3 and react front end for it, and I want to include these works in my portfolio when I apply to a job.\nDo you guys recommend that I should take the time to design these applications well enough or if I'm going to work in the back-end it's not that important? Don't get me wrong, they don't necessarily look \"bad\" or something like that, it's just plain bootstrap design, and it's not responsive.\n\nI can't really build responsive websites, but do you think it's worth to take the extra effort designing these applications?",
