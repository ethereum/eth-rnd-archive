Yesterday, zkSync completed the v24 upgrade, allowing the locked funds to be recovered. The Gemholic project withdrew 921 ETH from the contract and then transferred it to Ethereum and it is suspected of RugPull.”\n\nThat’s just sad and embarrassing. Kind of wonder if there’s a way core devs or an independent organization can kyc/verify projects/contracts.",
