        "content": "Hey, I tried asking around in different places but haven't been able to get a response... It's possible to specify a `min-bid` or `builder-profit-threshold` for a validator... I seem to recall there's a recommended value to keep building blocks locally while still not losing out on large blocks from builders... Would anyone happen to know what that recommended value is? And also, it seems that you can either set `min-bid` in mev-boost or `builder-profit-threshold` in Lighthouse (which I use), but sounds like those serve the same purpose? In which case, should I prefer one over the other?",
