For example, in a transaction the recipient’s wallet only accepts currency with the recipient’s own unique identifier marked as the owner, so a re-identification process is required by the sender before any transfer can occur, in all probability with additional authorization steps to re-identify. Wouldn’t this at least stop somebody from being able to steal everything inside a wallet if they gained unauthorized access through a private key.\nThe only possible way to bypass this is if the private key was compromised and they also have the credentials to re-identify the currency before transferring it to themselves. Right now, some wallets have extra security methods before a transfer can be made, but is a moot point if the private key is compromised.",
