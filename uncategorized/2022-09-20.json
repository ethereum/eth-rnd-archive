If you needed to spend thousands of ETH to buy bread, you wouldn't mind a few Gwei spent in tx fees. Sure, we can scale, several orders of magnitude and use L2s or whatnot to lower fees, but if markets price this in and the price of eth continues to increase, then fees will again be \"high\" pricing out the poor.",
