        "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI would like to introduce you to a project called StakeWise. It is an ETH2 staking platform, where users can share the Validator deposit in different ways, each sharing Validator rewards proportionally to the stake. It runs Validators for users, providing all essential infrastructure and monitoring. You can read more at https://stakewise.io/.\nRecently, it launched its Beta network, where users can try out the staking in pools (https://stakewise.io/#pool-staking) feature. In upcoming weeks staking on your own (https://stakewise.io/#private-staking) and staking with friends (https://stakewise.io/#group-staking) will be published as well.\nCurrently, it runs private ETH1 and ETH2 (prysm with minimal config) networks and the plan is to move to the official test network after interop 🚀 .\n\nIt would be great to receive feedback about the project in general and **staking in pools** feature in particular as it is available for trial already now.",
