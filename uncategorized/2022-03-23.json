But I think there is a mistake in whitepaper.\n\nWhitepaper says:\n\n\u003e If the value transfer failed because the sender did not have enough money, or the code execution ran out of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner's account.\n\nBut AFAIK also the sender's nonce changes if there is an out of gas situation. I tested it, and I am right. Am I missing something or there is misinformation?",
