I have learnt about ethereum and binance smart chain and how smart contracts and consensus algorithms works on them but have not done naything practically. Do I need to do practical evaluation before starting my own development?\n\nNeed guidance if someone already well aware of working on ethereum and binance smart chain.\n\nThanks",
