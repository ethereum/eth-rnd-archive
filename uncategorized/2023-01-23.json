        "content": "Does a slashed validator skip the exit queue?\n\n**Context of this question:**\n\nWhen a validator is slashed, it gets 3 types of penalty:\n- Initial penalty (`1/32` of effective balance, let's say 1ETH)\n- Leak during `~36 days`, let's say `0.08 ETH` cumulated penalty during these 36 days\n- A correlation penalty at `~18 days` depending of how many other validators are slashed in a window of `~36 days` center around the validator slashing epoch. (Let's say `0 ETH` since we need `\u003e 1%` of total validators to be be slashed for this penalty to be `\u003e 0 ETH`).\n\nLet's imagine the exit queue is very long (several months).\nIf a slashed validator skips the exit queue, it could be, in some circumstances, interesting to lose \"only\" `~1.08 ETH` (+ maybe correlation penalty) and to wait \"only\" for 36 days than losing no ETH at all and wait for several months before being able to withdraw.",
