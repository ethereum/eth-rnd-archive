It might be surprising to you but utility companies love renewable solar miners as we feed huge amounts of energy into the grid during daylight hours where energy demand is higher (and in some cases they charge higher fees). At night we take that energy back when people are sleeping and overall demand is lower.  We have been doing this for years, just because you and the POS media choose to only listen to uniformed sources does not strengthen your case and only makes you part of the problem of those jumping on board the latest POW cancel culture with unfounded claims.",
