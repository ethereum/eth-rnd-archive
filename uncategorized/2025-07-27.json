        "content": "Hii all , \n\nI have a question regarding rolling back a custom blockchain setup. Currently, I’m running Geth as the execution client and Prysm as the consensus client. I want to roll back the blockchain to a specific block height (e.g., block 500) while preserving all state up to that point.\n\nFor the execution layer, I successfully did the rollback using export and import with Geth:\n\n\n./build/bin/geth --datadir ../datadir export chain_export.rlp 0 32\n./build/bin/geth --datadir ../datadir import chain_export.rlp\n\nNow, I also need to bring the Prysm beacon node back to the same block while keeping all associated data till block 500, such as:\n\nAttestations,Validator balances,State as of that block\n\nEssentially, I want to create a new genesis.ssz that includes all state data up to block 500. Is this possible? If so, could you point me to any documentation or steps on how to achieve this?\n\nI strongly believe this should be feasible, but I’m stuck on how to regenerate the genesis state with existing data. Any guidance or references would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "Thanks for your help. \n\nI'm a bit stuck on the first step, though. I'm trying to export the BeaconState SSZ from my Prysm node for a specific historical slot (the one corresponding to execution block 500). I've searched through the prysmctl documentation and other Prysm resources, but I can't seem to find a direct CLI command for this. Could you point me to the correct command or best practice for dumping the state SSZ  using Prysm's tooling?\n\n\nOnce I have the state and reset it I plan to start the new beacon node with:\n\n```\n./beacon-chain --accept-terms-of-use=true \\\n  --datadir=/home/data/beacon-data-1 \\\n  --execution-endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:8551 \\\n  --rpc-host=0.0.0.0 --rpc-port=4000 \\\n  --http-host=0.0.0.0 --http-cors-domain=* --http-port=3500 \\\n  --p2p-tcp-port=13000 --p2p-udp-port=12000 \\\n  --min-sync-peers=0 \\\n  --verbosity=info \\\n  --slots-per-archive-point=32 \\\n  --suggested-fee-recipient=0x8943545177806ED17B9F23F0a21ee5948eCaa776 \\\n  --jwt-secret=/home/jwt_file/jwtsecret \\\n  --p2p-static-id=false \\\n  --chain-config-file=/home/el_cl_genesis_data/config.yaml \\\n  --genesis-state=/home/newly-generated-genesis.ssz \\\n  --contract-deployment-block=0\n```\n\nabove should work right ? , I just changed the genesis to new one ,\n\nAny guidance would be a huge help!
