I don't want to get into bikeshedding.  If ACD want to make the change next week, lets get it done.\nWe just need a star name and a portmanteau ASAP so we can get on with choosing fork focus and headliners for H-star + Bogotá.\nFor I-star I'll ensure the list gets more scrutiny so we don't have this happen again.",
