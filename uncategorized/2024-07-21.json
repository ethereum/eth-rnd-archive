Beaconcha.in correcly reported it inactive when I went looking for it. But when I reactivated it, the explorer reported it active before the attestation actually made it to the site... I do not know if this is a delay in reporting the earnings or a smart funny thing with checking other things like messages.  The image shows a validator reported as active (this is correct, I restarted it after leaving it inactive for a while) but still minutes before the first attestation was reported in the \"validator history\" pane",
