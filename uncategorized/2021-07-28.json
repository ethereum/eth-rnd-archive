The only thing I can think of is people still not coming to your chain which would make the time investment / cost investment inefficient.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Will non-Ethereum chains that adopted EVM have to change and re-adopt Ewasm after ETH 2.0? If that milestone is for early 2022, I would assume that adopting EVM this late may be less valuable.",
