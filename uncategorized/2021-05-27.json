But wouldn't it also hurt a bit if ETH gets too expensive if to little of it goes into circulation? Considering a lot will get burned with 1559. I guess since ETH is rather a \"consumable\" for the network. Wouldn't a ETH price too high slow down usage of the network? Or do I miss something there?",
