        "content": "So my understanding of the direction Ethereum is headed in is this: Keep consensus layer at L1, extract the execution layer to L2, and eventually extract some of the data layer (to a 3rd party?), i.e. 'history/state expiry'.   - Is this correct? And if yes, then doesn't that decrease the security of Ethereum if we're delegating execution to a relatively centralized body of L2's (L2s are essentially 'companies', no? Perhaps they're Ethereum-aligned companies, but companies nonetheless?), and delegating storage to a potentially less decentralized platform. That is to say, does this modular approach create added points of failure, since the three pillars are no longer unified and self-contained in a given L1 node?",
