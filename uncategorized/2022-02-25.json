Are we expecting commodity hardware to include these within the decade, for instance, or is it something that only block builders under PBS may have access to? \n\nThe purpose of the hardware would primarily be for cheaper/faster *verification*, right?",

In many cases it is acceptable to have that random number revealed far in the future (way more than `n*12 seconds`), so someone can start crunching away at the VDF on their laptop and find out what the random number is maybe `n*100` seconds later or something.",
