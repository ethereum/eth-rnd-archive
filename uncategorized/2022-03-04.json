To answer your poorly asked question though, censorship resistance is what a lot of the core devs focus their efforts on and there is a constant contention between the \"censorship resistance is paramount\" subgroup and the \"scalability is paramount\" subgroup in terms of prioritization.  Making it so one can run a trustless light client in the browser is the current long term target that will help us address the problem of people becoming too reliant on services like Infura.\n\nThat being said, you can and *should* be running your own Ethereum client.  It is hard to do right now and requires a huge amount of disk space, but it is certainly possible to run your own.  Alternatively, you can use an alternative centralized provider like QuikNode or Alchemy.",
