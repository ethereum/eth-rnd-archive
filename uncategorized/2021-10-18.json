I don't use wallets much and don't interact with apps much either, but the little I do shows that there's no standard naming at least post London. My intuition would be to give averages or last values for the baseFeePerGas and priorityFee. And then recommend the maxFeePerGas and priorityFee accordingl, but naming them so. I find it weird that I have to guess what each field in metamask or whatever site I'm seeing means. Typically the meaning is clear, but the fact that they chose a different name makes me look in their documentation just to make sure, that doesn't make any sense",
