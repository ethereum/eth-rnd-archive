        "content": "It is a slippery slope toward on-chain governance, as someone described above.  In this case, it is a small innocuous change but it requires setting up the *infrastructure* to have on-chain governance.  For example, you have to decide who is on the multisig which is a huge step in the direction of on-chain governance systems.  Once that infrastructure is setup, it is easy/tempting to use it for more coordination problems in the future, and over time you run into a problem with an ever-expanding scope of what on-chain governance does.",
