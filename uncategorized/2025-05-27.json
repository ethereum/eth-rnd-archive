The ethereum launchpad now points to ethstaker's deposit-cli which doesn't list the contributors in the github. The previous `staking-deposit-cli` doesn't really list top ups. `ethdo` used to do this so I assume that still works. Anything else? The signature is irrelevant for this so perhaps I'll do it myself, I guess the only thing is computing the sha of the ssz for the depositdata. I'm surprised that a quick google search did not find many results, surprisingly enough this still open issue by Hsiao-Wei https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/issues/39.",

This doesn't expose the validator keys in any way so it should be a regular web3 app where you connect a wallet that doesn't need to be related to the validator at all. I really think the community wants this instead of having to rely on coding this. Not sure who runs the launchpad, \u003c@550420431744794624\u003e you used to have something to do with this do you know? Probably ethstaker already has this tool available?",
