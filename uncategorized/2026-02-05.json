Quick question \n\nWhen an EIP (new one or updates to existing one ) gets merged to master on https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs, does that mean it's open for implementation across clients? Or do we need to wait for other signals before clients should implement?\nSame question for execution-apis updates - when are those changes considered ready for client implementation?\nContext: Looking to contribute meaningfully to a client(likely geth) with actual feature work rather than just small fixes/typos, so want to make sure I'm targeting the right EIPs/specs that are ready for implementation.\n\nThanks!",
