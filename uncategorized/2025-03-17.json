We got some clients running (Nimbus, Lighthouse and geth) and got a fully working validator and RPC node on the smallest of testnets (Sepolia and Chiado). Larger networks where limited by the raw CPU power used by the consensus clients. We had a talk about what we achieved at devcon. Recently, someone who attended our devcon talk tried it out on one of the newest RISC-V boards and managed to fully sync an Ethereum mainnet RPC node (https://www.web3pi.io/blog/ethereum-node-on-risc-v). They had to use a split setup though (2 Risc V boards). This means, we are getting there to have fast enough Risc V boards to run a validator. I would not do it as a production setup just yet though.",

        "content": "I personally think it is worth it to push in that direction. In my view there is a very big chance that Risc V will become huge in a few years. Mostly because there is no licensing issues with using the ISA, anyone can develop on it. ARM trying to squeeze more money out of Qualcomm and geopolitical export restrictions makes a lot of companies (and countries) rethink their dependencies. At the moment there are a lot of companies in the US as well as China pushing Risc V. In the US it is mostly embedded stuff whereas in China it is actual boards and Laptops for end users. There is an obvious chicken and egg problem at the moment. Software support is bad so it is harder to develop on it and that is why software support is bad. I do expect this to improve in the next few years though.\n\nFor Nimbus a way to improve the Risc V support would be to build clients by default for this plattform. Both nimbus clients can already be built on riscv64. An automated docker build would be awesome. Geth already does this.",
