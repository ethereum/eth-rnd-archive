        "content": "It seems a bit hard to pinpoint attackers quickly. Let's say that an attacker buys up 1/3 of supply, stakes it, then they start blocking finality. Can you only identify one validator (32 ETH) per block? So could you only slash 32 ETH per 12 seconds, or 230400 per day, or about a billion dollars worth of ETH per day? That's very expensive, but still within reach of USG or CCP especially if the attack caused the price to go lower after a week or so. Or is it easy to identify more than 1 slashable validator per block? I can imagine we can just look at a huge new supply of validators coming online at around the same time and say \"these are all the attacker\", but it seems like new innocent validators would get caught up in that mix. Maybe with chain analysis you can do pretty good at knowing N validators are all controlled by the same person who just got slashed?",
