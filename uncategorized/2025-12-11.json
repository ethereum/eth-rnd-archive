        "content": "Folks, a few weeks ago, I noticed the name voted for the hard fork after Glamsterdam was Heka - Bogota. I haven't made much noise about this at the moment because we were all busy with Fusaka, and it seemed a minor concern. But now that Fusaka fork is behind, I would like to request a second vote for the H star name. The reasoning behind this is that, so far, all of the star names we have selected (Altair, Bellatrix, Capella, Deneb, Electra, Fulu, and Gloas) are in the official list of star names given by the International Astronomical Union. Yes, I have been checking from the Altair fork.",

        "content": "Why is this important? Well, because stars do not really have names, we \"give\" them names. The question is: who has the authority to do so? For the L hard-fork, I could edit the Wikipedia page to say the star \"leobago\" is located at 137 light-years and that its name means \"the misty volcanoes of Nicaragua,\" or whatever. If we don't follow a minimum standard here, we might end up with fake fork names that mean nothing. On the other hand, this catalog is curated by a working group of international scientists, and they ensure that it includes names from all cultures around the world, no offensive or political names, etc. So, by simply using the list in the catalog, we avoid those issues.",
