        "content": "Question about (dank)sharding: I understand that L1 transactions will probably never be \"cheap\" and one should focus on L2 solutions to transfer low values without having to pay massive fees.\n\nWhat about small amounts of ETH close to or below the current tx-fee height on single addresses? Can those ever be claimed?\n\nIn the original sharding concept with 64 shards gas prices would have dropped by 64x once enabled... If the demand did not 64x until then, one would have had the chance to transfer small balances right after the rollout, right? But this concept is no more the plan AFAIK.\n\nWill the danksharding concept have a similar impact on L1 fees? I didn't completely get it, I guess.\n\nOr is there any other way to claim those small balances? AFAIK one has to do at least one L1 transaction to an exchange or against a L2 smart contract to liquefy those small balances.",
