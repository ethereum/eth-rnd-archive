My skills are limited to HTML, \u0026 some python. I found a new passion with ether. I plan on practicing my python skills \u0026 learning Solidity and Java (C if possible)..  I’m super interested and passionate about smart contracts and NFTs.. I’d love for this to be my job someday, but I’m the meantime I work in insurance - I’m trying to get them to understand the logic of using smart contracts for insurance policies .. ANYWAY.. THANK YOU!!",
