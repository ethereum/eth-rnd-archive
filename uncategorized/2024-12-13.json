        "content": "Hi everyone,\nI’m a PhD student recently doing a research project about Ethereum. We encountered several questions.\n1. Why the issuance curve has a square root scale? I saw many general arguments saying that it is a compromise between constant issuance and constant yield. I also know that it is concave thus desirable. But rigorously, how is this square root function determined? Is there any work proving that the square root scheme is optimal comparing with, say ^0.4 or log?\n2. Why is the target size of a block set to 15 million units of gas per block? What is the exact mathematics behind? And what is the dynamic of this target size? \nBasically, after the intuitions, I would like to know the accurate derivation of those parameters, and I expect that there is some document proving the optimality.\nThanks to you all in advance💕",
