I was able to successfully use your tip to roll back my Prysm node to the correct slot using the corresponding block number from the execution payload 🙌\n\nNow I’ve started my beacon node with:\n\n```\n--checkpoint-state=/home/data/checkpoint_state.ssz  \n--checkpoint-block=/home/checkpoint_block.ssz\n```\nBut I’m now running into a new issue — the chain is stuck and no new blocks are being proposed. My beacon node is showing this error:\n\n```\nERROR blockchain: Could not compute head from new attestations error=head at slot 25501 with weight 0 is not eligible, finalizedEpoch, justified Epoch 0, 0 != 796, 796\n```\nAnd the validator logs say:\n\n```\nERROR client: Could not request sync message block root to sign error=rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = error=the node is currently optimistic and cannot serve validators\n```\n\nThe head block root matches between beacon and execution clients, so I believe they're in sync. Is there any way I can force the validator to start proposing blocks despite this optimistic sync state? , or any way to resolve this issue on beacon , By putting --genesis-state instead of this --chckpoint , the error vanishes , but then the head state of beacon moves to 0 ,\n\nThanks again for any pointers !",
