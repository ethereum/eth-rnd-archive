I work at https://github.com/netdata/netdata  and I am thinking that people could benefit from a turn-key integration. The whole philosophy is that you install Netdata and it auto-configures itself, finds all data sources, create alerts, etc. I want to support this functionality for ethereum Full Nodes. My assumption is that operators are not professional DevOps/SREs but they have the same needs, as potential incidents literally cost money.  I am looking for people who will help me understand what metrics are important (e.g Geth has a very large number of metrics) and how they should be organized into charts. The goal is to make it dead-simple for new operators to have peace of mind about their infra.",
