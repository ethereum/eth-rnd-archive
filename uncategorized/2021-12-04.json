It’s very cool, coming from a tradfi / web2 background myself. I just wonder if the answer here is simply better documentation on either the EF site or ethereum.org\n\nI plan on attending the community call that Joshua and some of the other folks on ethereum.org are hosting next week but a simple, easy to find map or “org chart” of the structure of the broader ethereum community would be incredibly helpful for newcomers. Right now it’s a bit of a fragmented series of URLs, repos, and many disparate discord servers / telegrams. We don’t have to make the understanding of the humanistic side of ethereum cryptographic, if you know what I mean. Am coming at this from a place of wanting to help grow this ecosystem",
