If you have been on a \"correct\" chain for a while, you know more and more certain that you're likely to be correct. But indeed this one of the advantages of PoW. You still need to trust the software you run though, what forks you accept (i.e. what rules others are following), and it only works if you're the largest in your hashing algorithm hardware class (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum with ASICs and GPUs respectively for now, but there are no guarantees in life)",
