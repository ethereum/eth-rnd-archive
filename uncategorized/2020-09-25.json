You just need the most capable consensus building and tracking system, so you can get everyone on board, or know, concisely and quantitatively, what is still required to get every last person (who caress and not just some random sample of people that may not care) there.",

You don’t want compromise, you want to track all views, including the extreme ones.  Especially since the next revolutionary idea is always an extreme view that starts with one person.  Canonizer provides canonization algorithms, so everyone can use an algorithm that selects who they trust.  So, you can canonize things both ways, while still working to build consensus, form all different views.",
