So it's not possible to find all the storage slots to delete.\n\nPassing all the storage slots in a tx isn't practical, an accounts could have gigabytes of data. And we can't accept only a fraction of the storage to be deleted, lest it creates a lot of strange effects if a contract is redeployed at the same address with `CREATE2`.",
