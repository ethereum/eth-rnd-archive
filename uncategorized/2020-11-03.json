The name might simply be \"L2s\".",

I think if we were to make a channel for L2 coordination it would be in Eth1, but I'm not sure invested in which category it goes in. \u003c@250259755484839957\u003e have other teams or people reached out asking for this type of coordination? I'm worried we would create a channel without enough buy in and participation for it.\n\n\u003c@291925846556540928\u003e: what do you think of adding the channel?",
