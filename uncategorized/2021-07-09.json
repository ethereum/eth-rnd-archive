The more validators decide extracting MEV isn't ethical, the more MEV they leave on the table and the faster the MEV extractors accrue power, both directly and through people wanting the higher yields and staking with them, so there's no way to mount opposition. Even a minority of extractors can grow very powerful fast. For this MEV from reorgs, it only works if you get enough validators on board that they can force the reorgs, or the game doesn't even start. You can't attract people with higher yields without having already gotten significant stake on board",
