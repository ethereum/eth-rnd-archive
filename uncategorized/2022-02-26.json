But naively, why couldn't we leverage the fact that 'almost' everyone in the world has a dedicated cellphone, that getting tons of cell phones is not something bots can do with ease, and have a ProofOfCellPhone requirement whenever doing things like governance voting? That is, maybe something like having an encrypted dictionary which maps a public key to a specific cellphone number - say everyone maps their cellphone number to their public key - and basically, any time you want to do something on chain which is susceptible to bot spam, you basically have to prove your not a bot by entering a text code sent to your phone, where the number that the ethereum system pings is the one registered in the dictionary.  \u003c- I haven't fully thought this out (like the annoyance of having to input text messages anytime you transact), but it seems like a promising direction and tool to leverage for fighting network spam?",
