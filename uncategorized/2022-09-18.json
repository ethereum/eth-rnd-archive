A fork taking away funds\n1) has a very high barrier in forming consensus among devs, when is it ok, when isn't it.

The offending party, or the (mostly also users) that have delegated their money to earn interest on it.\n\nInstead of figuring out what undesirable/offending behavior is deterred by the threat of a fork, I'd say it's much healthier for the system at large to have less severe, low-barrier, measures. And withdrawals (also a threat of losing money for service providers for bad behavior) also matches the shades of gray of offending behavior. Outrageous behavior (with the threat of a fork) could lead to lots of users withdrawing such that the fork is not necessary. Less bad behavior could lead to at least some people withdrawing (=loss of income for staking provider).\n\nI'm not saying that centralized staking providers is something we want to have, but reality is that we do and lots of people use them (for various reasons, not having 32 ETH or wanting the liquidity). And unless those centralizing forces are non-existent, I _do_ symphatize with them (to some extent, like not burning their money without giving them an out).",

Since now Ethereum has a clear division of roles in the consensus and execution layer, I wonder if it wouldn't make sense to start thinking about introducing a second, completely novel execution layer, with all the things we want? This would allow Execution Layer 1 client to go in maintenance mode /R\u0026D to move the layer 1 to weak statelessness.
