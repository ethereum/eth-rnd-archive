If you have a trusted block that you are starting your sync from, you can walk the header chain backwards as newer blocks point at older blocks but older blocks don't point at newer blocks.",

If you start from an old header, you cannot know if it is a block that’s been produced due to a long-range attack, until you get to the recent blocks.",
