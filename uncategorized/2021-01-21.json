        "content": "I have a couple of questions regarding decentralized trading. I asked on reddit and a couple of Discord channels and didn't get any answers.\n1) is there some platform like uniswap but where one is allowed to submit a limit bid order, say to exchange N tokens X for M tokens Y, one deposits the tokens X into an audited contract until a matching order appears or until the order is cancelled. It seems to me that contract technology is capable of this and that there should be demand for this so I presume this exists.\n2) similar questions for options: I hold N token X and want to sell a call option at with strike M tokens Y for price L tokens Z. I deposit my tokens X into a contract and if someone wants to buy he deposits the tokens Z. The contract then a) gives me L tokens Z, b) mints N new tokens OptionX and gives it to the buyer. If the buyer wants to execute it deposits back the tokens along with the tokens Y, then the contract gives him my tokens X, i receive Y and option X is burned. \nI haven't seen any of this, but I'm very new to Ethereum and have never traded (nor am I interested, in any case I'd be more interested in implementing this)",

There are a number of apps that solve both problems, but this server isn't the right place to learn about them.  I think there are DeFi discord servers, or just search the internet and see what you find.  Maybe start by looking into `1inch.exchange` which is reasonably reputable and maybe branch out from there?",

In reality, the MEV present on Ethereum today is predominantly captured by DeFi traders through structural arbitrage trading strategies; miners indirectly profit from these traders’ transaction fees. One example of such structural arbitrage opportunities are Uniswap price arbitrage trades: when a Uniswap pool’s assets become mispriced, a profit opportunity is created to arbitrage the Uniswap pool back to parity with other trading venues. Of course, rather than letting the trader pay them a transaction fee for the privilege of collecting the arb profit, a miner could simply decide to run this strategy themselves.",
