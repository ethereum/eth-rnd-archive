You know, Allison's come inboard and hiring folks and has a budget for example.\nAnd you know, that's exactly where we wanna be. We are certainly being a little more cautious, just like, I think you see people like Amazon and apple being cautious, even though they're, continuing to see strong earnings and profits as we saw from Apple yesterday. So we see this as an opportunity to kind of expand the foothold we have, and we have real resources to do it with that also means that it's even easier for us to get more resources to do it with, especially in the short term, as we really think about what the next three, four years look like.\nhttps://youtu.be/EXsuizsMLe8?t=2087",
