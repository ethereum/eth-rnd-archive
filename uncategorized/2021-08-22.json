Zkrollups offer the best possible scalability because they only have to transfer state difference along with a correctness proof, so they will always win over all other scaling strategies. At the same time, proof generation is extremely expensive (I think some are starting to even use fgpas now) so in its current form it's fundamentally incompatible with decentralized l1. A rollup is currently the only way to retain decentralization with zkrollups.",
