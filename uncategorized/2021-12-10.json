So basically: Currently, mining software can be quite simple, because it just sorts all transactions it could include into the next block by payment, and then includes as many of them into the block as possible. This is the way geth implements it, anf you can’t really do any better if you would write your own mining software. The exception to that is of course MEV, where running modified mining software (namely mev-geth) is significantly more profitable. But at least mev-geth is open source. We really don’t want a situation where miners can have a big advantage by running some proprietary smart algorithm, because that would lead to centralization pressures over time.",

So I looked at how far from the theoretical optimum different strategies are. And turns out, there is this backlog method that gets you really close in profitability to that optimum. So as long as geth (and for after the merge all the other execution clients) just implement that one, that removes any incentive for people to write their own versions, and so removes that potential centralization pressure.",

I was told that  ``Unless you were running a slasher at that time period, there is no way to historically determine there was censoring occurring for slashings being included in blocks.'' in response to using a distance proxy (i.e. slashing not occurring in slot N+1 after slashable offence happening in slot N). So, I was thinking about running a slasher actually and found this guide  https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/how-to-run-a-slasher. Do you Guys think that is a feasible option to get the data on censorship in slashings?\" Would I need to stake in 32eth here to set up a validator in the mainnet using the above?",
