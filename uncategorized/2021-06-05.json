        "content": "I'm glad you asked this question. I don't follow EIPs cause my main interest is on ETH2, but I experienced the very same thing that you are mentioning. I started tracking closely my ETH2 client of choice and realized that actually the specs move faster than what the software engineers can follow at times. Luckily for us there's a centralized place where the interface between protocol and implementation takes place, and the specs repo is a canonical place to look at. I think you are out of luck on Eth1 though. In any case, my (very short) experience following the specs repo gives me the impression that very very few people are actually following the details of what's going on in depth (it's reasonable given the pace and breath) and that development happens much faster than what I would have liked it.",
