L will intersect E at a point you reflect it across the x axis (you multiply by -1 the y coordinate) and this point P would be your result. If k = 3 you take P and you add it to G. Those two points intersect E at a particular point....\n\nWhen k is big, and even if an attacker knows G and kG he can't compute k in polynomial time. However a person knowing k can compute kG. (This is the trapdoor)",
