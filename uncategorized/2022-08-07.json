It is one of many shady things F2Pool is doing.\n\nBased on what I saw, the most that contributed to the low uncle rate is a suspected cartel between Chinese pools that prioritizes their own blocks when choosing what block to uncle. Two pools I'm 95% sure are part of this are F2Pool and Poolin.\n\nF2Pool is also running several other attacks on mainnet for months, if not years. I also discovered that they are mining sister blocks when there is high MEV to steal the rewards from honest miners.",
