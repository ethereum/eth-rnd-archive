Are*coredevs* execution client devs that are already familiar with every single opcode in the EVM or can consensus client devs that are curious but don't know the basics of reentrancy learn something in the planned workshop? If it's the latter, with a couple of highly intensive minicourses, I'd be very much interested regardless of the place (although Bogotá would be perfect given that I plan to go anyway)",
