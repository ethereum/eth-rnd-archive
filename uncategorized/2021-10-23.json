        "content": "Guys, can I please ask you for explanation of one concept? Specifically, I am trying to determine when whistleblowing message that led to slashing of validator 14415 happened at earliest. So taking this example, validator 14415 was slashed at slot 457006. Given this screenshot, my understanding is that he was voting at slot 456995--which is at epoch 14278--but was late and his vote counted at epoch 14281. Later on, he voted  at slot 457005--which is at epoch 14280--**correctly** to epoch 14281 but since he voted for two conflicting blocks in the same epoch, he got slashed. So the whistleblowing message **couldn't happen before slot 457005** because only at this slot slashable offence happened. Is this correct?\n\nPleaseee help me with that.",
