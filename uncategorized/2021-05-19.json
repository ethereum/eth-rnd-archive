        "content": "If there are faster computers and they all have faster internet, most easily achieved by having fewer nodes, then they can send blocks between themselves faster. The chance that a chain splits or miners are (accidentally) working on an uncle block depends on the blocktime and the latency. If someone else has found the next block and you don't see their message, then you're still working on the old one. If all your nodes are near each other (centralised) then propagation times will be lower. \n\nLarger blocksizie like BSC slows down the blocktime, since there's more data to transmit and process (taking longer).",
