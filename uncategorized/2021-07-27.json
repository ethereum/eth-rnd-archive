There's no optimization there, it's a straight Ethereum clone: The reason that tx are fast there is that it doesn't have the network effects that ETH has; the reason it's cheap is that you can't really trade its token, by design. Think of it as a testnet with a residual value to the token, which makes it more secure than a traditional testnet. It's meant for trying web3 things.",
