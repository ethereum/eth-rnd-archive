I'm running the `prysmaticlabs/prysm-beacon-chain:v5.0.1` pulled from dockerhub rn. I see that on one machine `./prysm/beaconchaindata` takes `431G`, but on the other, it takes `471G`. If these clients are running for a super long time and not in the process of syncing, what could make that difference? Not critical or anything, I've just started hitting the disk space limits and did a took a look on a disk usage, noticed that and now curious haha.\n\u003c@755590043632140352\u003e \u003c@399309815517544451\u003e \u003c@833706406699073536\u003e Sorry for pinging you guys, I hope you don't mind 😅",
