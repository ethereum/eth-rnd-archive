Lightning Network is something new where people are running their own nodes, managing liquidity and setting up channels with each other. Fun! (for some people)\n\nThey also are working on a plugin that will enable anyone with a lightning node to become a custodian for other people. Then they download for example BlueWallet and connect to the LNDhub and then uses its channels and liquidity for payments so you don't have to think about that if you don't want to. Exciting!",
