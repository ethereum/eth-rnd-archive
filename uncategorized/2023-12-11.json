We hope it's also of value for the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole since we include statistics on tool usage and other EVM languages as well. \n\nLast year, we received 1401 entries from 100 different countries across the globe.\n\nPlease participate \u0026 help us spread the word about it! Thanks! 💗 \n\n🐦 https://x.com/solidity_lang/status/1733167411472581016?s=20\n\n📃https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/pV-DdryeJoYUWvW+gXsFaMNynEY7t5mUsgeD1urgwSE/",

        "content": "Wow, I guess today is the day of protocol-adjacent announcements - I had one too 😅 ! \n\nOver the summer, the EF has funded a group of 30+ researchers to explore a wide range of questions around \"protocols\" across a wide range of domains, from the web, to architecture, memory, and more.  \n\nMost of it is only adjacent to Ethereum, but a few topics are pretty closely linked (e.g. how do protocols die). This Wednesday, we'll be releasing the first batch of research outputs. Everything will be freely accessible online, and we'll be giving out a limited number of print copies to people interested in studying protocols as a first class topic. \n\nMore info \u0026 stream link here: https://bit.ly/protocolkit-launch ☀️",
