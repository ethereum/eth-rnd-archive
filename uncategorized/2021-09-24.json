If we assume each validator has a balance of around 34ETH at the time of exit we're looking at less than 40,000ETH per day, which I doubt is enough to cause a supply shock, even if it was all sold immediately.\nI am not sure how valid this argument is, since once withrawals are allowed, centralized pools like Coinbase or Binance may allow their users to withdraw arbitrarily large amounts of ETH since they can cover that.",
