It's going to become unmanageable pretty fast. \n\nI would not share invite links on twitter, or reddit for that matter, only in DMs for people who are genuinely interested in discussion or observing. Otherwise this becomes a helpdesk or people asking \"when phase 0???\" \"When EIP 1559???\"\n\nThe alternative is to more rigorously enforce off-topic bans.",
