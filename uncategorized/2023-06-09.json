But to prove a withdrawal from an L2 you only need the output root on L1 and a merkle proof. Generating that merkle proof would need the world state so you would need some node to be in sync. How you would get that node in sync depends on what the actual data availability plan is. It’s a pretty extreme case to think that there’s literally no nodes online at all for the L2 that you could sync from so maybe not unreasonable to make that an assumption. In fact that’s the same assumption that L1 relies on - you have to be able to get either world state or all historic blocks from peers. Users can maintain their own node to ensure they always have such access. \nBut you could also post historic blocks to some other form of persistence than L1 blobs so they are available and you could regenerate even if you can’t find L2 peers - what that would be that is likely to survive this rather extreme scenario I’m not really sure.",
