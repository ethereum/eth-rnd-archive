I'm wondering whether there's discussion on encouraging an ecosystem around AI code agents like https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-codemender-an-ai-agent-for-code-security/ for security (or https://www.testsprite.com/ for smart contract testing). I also see that a bunch of individuals have created various Solidity security benchmarks like https://x.com/muellerberndt/status/1962078932024672514 that can further be used to improve and fine-tune such tools. \n\nI've architected a DeFi risk agent and built an MVP for it. I'll be writing a detailed blog post about it soon as well. **I'd love to engage in further discussion regarding the future of dAI on Ethereum (not limited to just code security) and make impactful contributions - if anyone could point me towards the right avenues for these discussions, it'd be awesome.**",
