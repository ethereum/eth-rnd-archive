Using the validator balances endpoint on Teku https://consensys.github.io/teku/#tag/Beacon/operation/getEthV1BeaconStatesWithState_idValidator_balances will it always return the balance for all validators in the network? E.g. if a validator is offline and being penalized (and so is not attesting) then each epoch will this endpoint return an up to date balance?",

If you have 10,000 attendees there for a 2 week period there's quite a high chance that 1 or more will be murdered.",
