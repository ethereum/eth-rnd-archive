The simplest anchor would be a recent blockhash, and I'm looking for a large set of places that will freely give out the latest blockhash via HTTP API.\n\nAlternatively, does anyone know of any extremely light clients that can follow the latest blockhash via libp2p?  They wouldn't provide or ask for any other data, just trying to follow head blockhash in a trust-minimized/decentralized way.",
