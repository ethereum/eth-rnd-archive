        "content": "this is protocol related, but then I will point to a topic about application layer\n\nconsidering cold/hot accesses (for storage, or accounts) in the context of a block, instead of the context of a transaction. it could be difficult to implement, and it would have the oddity of making transactions be able to endure big ranges of gas expenses depending on where they're mined.\n\ncons: probably hard to implement, since it breaks many assumptions and the clients would have to add a bunch of complexity\npros: cheaper gas for users. more reasonable gas pricing.\n\nnow, onto the app layer part: uniswap has been using big routers to do things, and now there's `permit2`. Permit2 is arguably healthy for the protocol (less bytecode on new tokens). But it's punished by the gas pricing, since users have to do more cold accesses. (making up numbers now) probably, most blocks there are ~20 redundant permit2 cold accesses. The execution clients are benefiting from less cache misses, due to interacting with this contract, so there's pricing mismatch with the costs.",
