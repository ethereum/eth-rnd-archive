        "content": "Hi all, posting on behalf of a researcher friend at METR (https://metr.org/), a nonprofit focused on studying AI capabilities and safety. \n\nThey’re running a study on how AI tools affect real engineering workflows, and would love to include experienced Ethereum contributors.\n\nThe idea: \n- contributors get $50/hr to keep working on issues in their own repos.\n- On some tasks AI tools are allowed, on others they’re not… goal is to gather solid data on whether these tools actually change velocity or quality in open source development.\n\nThe study is meant to support maintainers while also building a clearer picture of how AI is impacting real projects like Ethereum clients, infra, and tooling.\n\nIf interested, here’s the sign-up link: https://form.typeform.com/to/ZLTgo3Qr",
