But it's not really the people who are actually participating in the community typically, as miners invest in hardware.\nI'd suggest you looking at https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/. This is **not** the place where **all** mining community is, but there is a significant chunk of English-speaking miners there. Most of discussions are about mining, but if you go in comments of popular posts not about hardware, you can see a lot of miners talking together discussing the ecosystem, showing their interest to the project.\n2. Check https://www.youtube.com/c/RedPandaMining https://www.youtube.com/c/BitsBeTrippin https://www.youtube.com/user/SerpentXSF https://www.youtube.com/c/VoskCoin and see it yourself, how enthusiastic miners are about the entire ecosystem around the project, not just mining itself. Also around 90% prefer Mainnet still.\n3. Inflation is not huge, also it is compensated in full and even results in negative loss by a) price boost miners do by attracting more people to the ecosystem 2) Fee burn introduced by EIP-1559. Even if we leave a) or b) alone, the net loss becomes negative either way.",
