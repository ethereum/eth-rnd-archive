Perhaps it's worth looking into some kind of mitigating tools or auditing patterns within the base protocol or whatever. These hacks on networks worth 600 million dollars, given that these networks are the ones that we are betting our scalability, show that they are not only overvalued and immature as much as there's a systemic failure when they become the norm",
