One thing that is still puzzling me is why the block in the second reorg I investigated (https://www.samlewis.me/2022/03/beacon-chain-reorgs/#slot-3340347) was reorged. As I describe in the write up, if I understand the fork choice rules, it seems like it shouldn't have been reorged and the network should have included it in the main chain. Anyone have any ideas on what I might be missing?",
