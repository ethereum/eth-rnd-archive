        "content": "“A chain of vulnerabilities we discovered and exploited during our research allowed us to gain full control, run code and extract private keys of hundreds of validators on multiple major networks, potentially leading to direct losses equivalent to over one billion dollars in cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BNB, SUI, APT and many others.\nThese validators were hosted by a validator infrastructure provider called InfStones, a reference to the “infinity stones” in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where the supervillain Thanos slowly collects infinity stones because once he collects all of them he is able to yield absolute power. That happens to be an extremely useful metaphor to help explain the attack vector we describe in this post; by attacking the validators that run a distributed network separately, and collecting, over time, their private keys the same way Thanos collected Infinity Stones, sophisticated attackers can gain unlimited power over the network, and either DoS it or control it entirely.”\n\nhttps://0d.dwalletlabs.com/the-billion-dollar-exploit-collecting-validators-private-keys-via-web2-attacks-4a385a5bb70d",
