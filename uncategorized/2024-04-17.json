        "content": "Q: Have people looked at contract/code expiry for the EVM like how Arbitrum Stylus is going to do it? I think they are doing 1 year which is way too short. But maybe something like 7-10 years would be long enough.\nExpiring state is fine for state growth. Every time we add more EVM opcodes or e.g. EOF, we now have to support the contracts and the opcodes forever. (see SELFDESTRUCT pain and suffering)\n\nWhat if EOF V1 contracts had some set lifetime like 10 years. After that you can renew your contracts (if V1 has not been deprecated in the meantime) or you'd need to redeploy to EOF V# that has been deployed in the meantime.\n\nThe advantage of this is that execution clients now have a roadmap/timeline to drop support for old EOF formats without breaking promises to users.\n\nThe downside is that contracts are no longer immutable which has been a fairly strong guarantee up till this point.\n\nSwitching to a new execution environment like EOF could be a good time to try such a change.",
