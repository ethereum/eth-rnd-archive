I was hoping for command key file and same folder structure, so a staker only needs to keep one copy of key files in one location, to reduce the chance of slashing, seems not possible at this time. \n\nNow i'm hoping for a common denomitor with batch deposit capability. For example, batch create key files and batch deposit by a tool, then import into different clients. Launchpad can batch create key files, however, can't do batch deposit. Both lighthouse and prysm can import launchpad's key files, however, can't do batch deposit for those imported keys.\n\nlighthouse can create key files and then do batch deposit.\n\nkey files created in lighthouse can't be imported to prysm, vice verse.",
