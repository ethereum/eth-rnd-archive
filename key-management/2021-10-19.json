My feeling is this could be retrofitted because a thief would be crazy to try and add biometrics to a key because he/she/they would be doxxing themselves. Face ID Biometrics seems to make sense, can this be possible?",

Sadly I dont think the private keys especially for nodes are secure enough and I would like to think there could be ways to make them more secure, in the long run, not only for the owner of the key but also the security of the network! its a win win, if some want anonymity than fair dos but it would be cool if its a choice, that way stolen, lost or breached keys could be identified, I think its a serious issue that needs to be resolved for the future of crypto in general, thanks for your reply btw 🙂",

UKJT stated (note this was an opinion not the law, although it does carry significant weight) that a smart contract has many similarities to a traditional contract, and can indeed carry the force of law.  However, you don't get to make up the terms of the contract.  The deposit contract has very clear terms, explicit and laid out above in my previous text.  By sending a signed transaction (also note that UKJT stated that a signature does have legal force) you agreed to those terms.\n\nRegardless of the provenance of the contract, you cannot add terms that you think should be to it after the fact.  You think the contract says one thing, and in fact it says another.  There is no work to be done to \"fix\" lost keys because they do not fall under the remit of the contract.",
