Additionally, a few areas were clarified and the tests were updated. The full diff can be seen here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/compare/50c86e1..bf62883\nIt might be worth agreeing if we're going to use this update in Altona or not. If we don't, EIP-2335 will be different across clients. It's not relevant to consensus, however it might be annoying for some users and perhaps cause dramas if we need to move keys fro client_a to client_b if client_a has a finality-stopping bug.",
