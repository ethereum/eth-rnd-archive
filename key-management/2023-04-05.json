At first sight it seems like it would be possible to do hash to curve and calculating the pairing on chain even without EIP-2537 if one really wanted to and the EIP would just simplify and make it more gas efficient. Just wondering if  you (or anyone else) have looked into that at all or if there is some issue I'm not seeing right now.",
