        "content": "Good call today.  One thing I think we didn't get to was the KDF on EIP-2335.  My opinion is that if we want only one then we should go with PBKDF2 as it has widespread support (and a lot of people will already have implemented it as part of their EIP-2335 work to date).  If we want to stick with multiple options someone should check out the availability of argon2 code to see if it's feasible to use across all the platforms we need to support.  If so, I'd be fine with either adding it to the list or replacing scrypt with it.\n\nI'm ambivalent on the question of one or multiple KDFs.  If pushed I'd come down on the side of a single KDF for simplicity's sake, but I don't have any strong preference.",
