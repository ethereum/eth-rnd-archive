Have we already talked about eip-2334 and the potential desire for withdrawal keys and signing keys to remain entirely separate? 2334 requires that signing keys be a child of the withdrawal key...\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003c@!399309815517544451\u003e perhaps this can be seen as a feature, and not a bug?\n\nWhile your funds can't be moved without the withdrawal key, as it stands the signing key is needed to initiate a withdrawal.\n\nIf you choose to use a staking provider, you will have to hand over control of your signing key.\n\nThis means your ability to exit, if they go offline, or you're unhappy with the service you're receiving, depends on them. \n\nIn other words, when you use a staking provider, you surrender your control over your ability to exit, *unless* you're able to re-derive your signing key from your withdrawal key and initiate an exit yourself.\n\nP.S. As far as I understand, although it is possible to do the key exchange in a way that obligates your staking provider to provide you with a signed exit before you submit your deposit, there is a risk that this message is invalidated by a fork. So you have the added responsibility of keeping track of the validity of that message, and possibly, multiple messages (which is not great from a UX PoV)",
