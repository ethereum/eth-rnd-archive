In particular from from `scrypt` which is very slow to decrypt to `pbkdf2` which is much, much faster.  `scrypt` is great for security so offline keystores should use it and it makes sense as a default, but it's not great for validator client keys because of how long it takes to decrypt (and how much memory it needs).",
