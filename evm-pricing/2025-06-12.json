This might have already been covered but my hunch is that the only way it’d workis if you gave all of the gas refunds  at the very end of the block - otherwise I could write two txs that lead to an impossibility result by having\n- tx1 (if a!=warm, call b)\n- tx2 (if b!=warm, call a)\n(I’m oversimplifying the attack but you get the idea)\n\nBut storing all of the balance refunds and then doing them all the at the end of the block seems suboptimal from an engineering perspective…. A whole bunch of extra state writes.\nFor BALs there are no refunds; or do you mean the other proposal?",
