I created a benchmark for `MOD` instruction because I'm guessing `MOD` is one of the weakest points.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1151\n\nThis is in essence a sequence of `DUPx` + `MOD` instructions. And all the arguments to the `MOD` are in the ranges ~256 mod 192-128 bits because this is the worst case in evmone/intx.\n\nIn evmone, where ECRECOVER runs at 110 Mgas/s:\n- `MOD` benchmark gives 220 Mgas/s with old numbers,\n- `SMOD` benchmark gives 200 Mgas/s with old numbers.\n\nWith new numbers we should get:\n- `MOD`: 55 Mgas/s\n- `SMOD`: 50 Mgas/s",
