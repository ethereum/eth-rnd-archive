Regarding backwards compatibility in context of gas pricing, would an initial idea be (1) track down contracts which have hardcoded gas and (2) figure out how \"popular\" these are? Solidity by default will `GAS CALL` and thus \"just\" put current available gas on stack, and programmers have to explicitly set a gas param on the call to override this (I am not sure how much this is used in practice)",
