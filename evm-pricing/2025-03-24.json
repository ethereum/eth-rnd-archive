        "content": "\u003cmisilva73\u003e Hi all! \nI am working on an empirical analysis related to the multidimensional gas model. A part of it involves breaking down the gas cost of each opcode into the corresponding resources, i.e., compute, history growth, state growth, address access, block size, bloom topics, and memory. Some opcodes are straightforward; e.g., the ADD opcode only uses compute, so we can assign its full cost of 3 gas units to the compute resource. However, some opcodes use multiple resources, and it is unclear from their gas cost formula how the total cost is distributed among the various resources. I assume these formulas came from summing the estimated costs among the various resources, but I have not found such an analysis.\nI summarized the information I gathered in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17sL4mPbDZEtDAH2i0eG0YlzT8x4k88Jq3YhyE379m1w/edit?usp=sharing. The yellow rows are my guesses, and the red rows are the ones I am not sure how to split. Does anyone know how to fill in the red rows? Or can you point to the person most likely to know?\nThanks for the help!",

There is no any deeper meaning to them, no hidden dimensions, etc.\n\nAlso the assumption that the current values are fair or correct is wrong.
