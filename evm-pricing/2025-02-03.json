        "content": "\u003cIsabella.eth\u003e We show that most Ethereum rollups, despite claiming to inherit the security of Layer 1, remain vulnerable to forced shutdowns via compromised admin keys. We illustrate how governments or well-funded adversaries could seize control of multisig keys to disable rollup functionality and lock user assets. To address these vulnerabilities we introduce Facet, an Optimism‐based sovereign rollup specifically engineered for “hard times.” Facet eliminates privileged Layer 1 contracts, uses a native token with a “proof-of-L1-blockspace” issuance mechanism, and adopts a permissionless (“based”) sequencing approach. These features eliminate single‐party upgrade controls, thus preserving censorship resistance on par with Ethereum Layer 1—even under extreme threats of government‐mandated shutdowns.",
