Computational complexity of ECRECOVER is much higher than MOD, which is reflected in our results as well. But in your example ECRECOVER is 110 Mgas/s and MOD is 220 Mgas/s, quite the same order of magnitude. Can you share the program you used to benchmark ECRECOVER? I'd like to run it through our tests and compare (re @chfast: I've done some work for verify the old/new numbers. I created a benchmark for MOD instruction because I'm guessing MOD is one of the weakest points.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1151\n\nThis is in essence a sequence of DUPx + MOD instructions. And all the arguments to the MOD are in the ranges ~256 mod 192-128 bits because this is the worst case in evmone/intx.\n\nIn evmone, where ECRECOVER runs at 110 Mgas/s:\n- MOD benchmark gives 220 Mgas/s with old numbers,\n- SMOD benchmark gives 200 Mgas/s with old numbers.\n\nWith new numbers we should get:\n- MOD: 55 Mgas/s\n- SMOD: 50 Mgas/s)",
