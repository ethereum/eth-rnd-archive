        "content": "Using the deterministic scheme by passing in null as you have done in your code you should be able to produce exactly the same signature as in the test vectors. There is likely a mistake somewhere either in your code or in the library. Sometimes you might need to hash the data before signing if it doesn't hash internally (keccak256 in this case). Or perhaps the RLP encoding isn't correct. To determine if the ECDSA library is working correctly you could try signing something very basic using the deterministic scheme and comparing to another library that uses the same scheme. It is very possible to get different signatures from different implementations depending on how they are configured.",
