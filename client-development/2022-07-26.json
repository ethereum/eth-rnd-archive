Specifically, this is the command i'm running:\n\n```\ngeth --goerli --http --http.addr=127.0.0.1 \\\n--http.port=8545 --http.vhosts=\"*\" --http.api=\"eth,net,engine,rpc,web3\" \\\n--authrpc.jwtsecret=\"jwt.hex\" --authrpc.addr=http://127.0.0.1 --authrpc.port=8551 \\\n--authrpc.vhosts=\"*\" --http.rpcprefix=/\n```\n\nThe above maybe having a lot of flags but i'm trying out all of them to be sure.\n\nThe issue is that the endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8551` is unreachable although `http://127.0.0.1:8545` is reachable.\nPS: My geth node is fully synced.\n\nAny thoughts on what i maybe doing wrong?",
