We (our team/generally) just had a lot of these cases lately.\n\nI think this could be as simple as having an additional CHANGELOG section at the end of an EIP (e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1052.md), a new rule to always add a short changelog entry and a new version when an EIP is edited (so: for every/most EIP PRs) and then some agreements what version to target for the different EIP states (e.g. DRAFT -\u003e REVIEW could be going from 0.1 -\u003e 0.9 range, just an example) and some (rough) outline what version bump to do on what kind of change.\n\nA bit more work on (EIP) PRs but I guess very much justified by the benefits and clarity which would come out of that.\n\nTHoughts? 🤔 Already discussed (likely)?",
