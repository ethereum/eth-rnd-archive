I am mostly asking because I have a regex expression for grabbing a chunk of those files in a specific range 60000000 - 90000000 (`geth/chaindata/[6-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].ldb`) that is at a certain size currently and want to make sure that no more files get added in that range.  I'm not sure if after compaction it will create new files in a specific range if one of those numbered files is removed from compaction",
