Once we have some nodes running on the new network, I will shut it down and restart it\n    - For this, I will need some (preferable standalone) client that implements new history subnetwork (that Glados will use)\n- Glados now only uses [client info from ping message](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/master/ping-extensions/extensions/type-0.md) (meaning, the \"c\" field of the ENR is no longer used)\n    - That's why you will see many \"Unknown\" nodes that are actually nimbus\n- Glados doesn't exactly care what protocol version is being used, but it depends on the client that it runs with",
