I made a PR on the specs repo which resolve the problems found [Update Ephemeral Header specification to account for wrong assumptions #387](\u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/pull/387\u003e).\n\nAll client Teams should review this PR to be aware how our `Ephemeral Header` specification is changing. A basic TLDR is we will now be using bridges instead of sideloading EL Headers from the `Beacon Network`. A concise description for the issues/reasons behind this change can be found in the PR. A lot more context can be found in \u003c#1331654847648497726\u003e, that discussion is quite long though 😁.",
