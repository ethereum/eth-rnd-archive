        "content": "On the ethereumjs client, we recently updated our client to comply with `ethereum/tests` v10.2 which introduced some stricter tests regarding leading zeroes in RLP encoded data and we wanted to make sure we're covering one of the edge cases.  Based on that understanding that RLP encoded integers should be big endian with no leading zeroes, would a hex encoded string `0x01` be considered invalid under this definition when translated to bytes?  The reason this is a question is that our implementation of the leading zeroes test is translating the hexidecimal strings of RLP data received over the wire  to bytes (i.e. Javascript `Buffer`/`Uint8Array`) and then checking the first byte to see if its `00` which would indicate a leading zero.  In this case, both a hex encoded string of `0x1` and `0x01` would get converted to a `Buffer \u003c01\u003e` .  Should both of these represent a valid encoding of the integer value 1 or should the second one be considered invalid?",
