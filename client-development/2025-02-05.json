I'm using data from test vector from the spec and got verifying records to work. But when I try to sign a record with test vector private key, I get a different signature. I'd really appreciate help. The code is here: https://github.com/dszlachta/kaz/blob/feature/enr/lib/enr/record.zig#L219 (make test executes the tests)",
