I have a very old PoC of beam sync of like 1.5 years ago, this runs on the `eth` protocol, but this is now deprecated in favour of `snap` sync (?). \u003c@364458974906548225\u003e / \u003c@425615769280315392\u003e would you say that beam sync is now deprecated / \"dead\" in favour of snap sync, or would it still make sense to create this to use `GetTrieNodes` by `devp2p/snap` protocol?",

        "content": "Maybe \"classic\" Beam Sync (by starting to validate execution right away from the head of the chain) isn't helpful in a snap sync world, because I suspect it would take longer to get the content you need by using `GetTrieNodes`. It's probably long enough that you'd never catch up, and might as well wait for snap to finish.\nBut it would still be super useful to support the `eth_` endpoints before sync has finished (still takes at least several hours, last I heard), which you could support by using the same principle as Beam Sync (like an `eth_call` that pauses to get data as needed, whenever it's missing locally)",
