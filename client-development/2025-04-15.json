I believe \u003c@510413979080720385\u003e is out of concerns? and should be approving it soon.\n\nIf other teams want to 👍 the PR, or raise final concerns consider this a heads up. If there are any concerns brought up we will go from there and work to resolve them. But assuming no further concerns are brought up I would be looking to merge the PR on Wednesday or Thursday so maybe like 30-40 hours? As I don't think there is anything else blocking the PR, or nothing has been brought up except fairly minor things at this stage.\n\nHere is the PR \u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/pull/387\u003e",
