It will almost certainly involve releasing new versions of clients on a very short timeframe and would cause massive amounts of collateral damage along the way.  No one takes the thought of it lightly, but there is value in having the nuclear option available in the case of some kind of catastrophic failure.",

        "content": "not disagreeing with this, just wandering how does it look in the case of reverting a finalized block. Curently a bug in geth that causes a consensus split can take a couple of days to be resolved and in principle we reorg and that's it, with all the severe consequences that that carry. After the merge, if the numbers in etherscan are more or less correct, if you don't roll a fix and most validators apply it in less than 15 minutes then you are in a situation where you finalized a bad fork. Reverting this is not as trivial since a simple \"reorg\" cannot happen without slashing a bunch of validators. So a manual intervention would have to involve all consensus clients at the same time it looks to me.",
