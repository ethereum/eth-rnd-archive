This is a somewhat weird time as [Protocol versioning and upgrading. #371](\u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/issues/371\u003e) hasn't been formalized yet, which would make it so clients could deploy `Deploy accept codes` in an async manner.\n\nSo we have 2 options\n- 1) deploy the breaking change across clients around the same timeframe\n- 2) push \u003c@364458974906548225\u003e to finish formalizing [Protocol versioning and upgrading. #371](\u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/issues/371\u003e) so clients can ship `Deploy accept codes` on their own time.\n\nI am not picky, it would be nice to do 1) since 2) isn't formalized yet which would be a blocker of 2). 2) is a little complex to implement as well, but that isn't the biggest concern. I would appreciate feedback on the issue, then we can make a more defined push from there on how we should continue. It looks like 2) may take some time to finalize, 1) is pretty minimal to do so maybe 1) is the play, then for future breaking changes we can exclusively use 2) once it is formalized and mature, unless their is a reasonable timeframe for when 2) would be formalized into the specification, waiting e.x. a month for as small of a change as `accept codes` feels a little much. I would be fine waiting like a week for 2) to formalize, but I am not sure that is possible based off how long it as taken to formalize other changes in the past.",
