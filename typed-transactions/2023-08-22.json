Until that agreement is reached, I think it's easier to have all the ideas in one place.\n\nLikewise, EIP-4895 also defines some ideas that affect CL specs. The approach was similar, first to create the EIP with the idea, then materialize a matching spec in CL repo and extend with tests.",

It can't be referenced until it exists somewhere (either as a draft EIP, or as a merged consensus-specs PR). For consensus-specs PRs, it seems they only get merged once people are sure that they want them. While for EIPs, it is common for them to describe an idea that is still under discussion. Anyway, if a maintainer has a strong preference, I'm fine moving it wherever they want. Until then, I guess leaving it in the EIPs repo is alright.",
