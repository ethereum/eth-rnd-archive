        "content": "Updated https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6404 and https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6466\n– Both are now based on EIP-6493 `SignedTransaction` / `Receipt`\n\nUpdated https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6465\n– Added typed withdrawal envelope to support exchange of SSZ `Withdrawal`; this is the same mechanism as defined in EIP-6493 / EIP-2718\n– Reusing the consensus `Withdrawal` here instead of creating a `PartialContainer` wrapper, as this type doesn't seem to be as much in flux as transactions / receipts. But we could of course also decide to go the `PartialContainer` route here as well.\n\nUpdated https://eth-light.xyz\n– There is now a list of all the SSZ EIPs on the landing page\n\nThat completes the spec work for now (pending polish / tests)! \n– All the EIPs are now updated to the latest `PartialContainer` approach.\n– Networking specs have been included; this means, SSZ transactions are supported in the mempool as well, instead of solely being a post-block-inclusion representaiton.\n– Live demo is available via https://eth-light.xyz for latest blocks; can also pass txhash via URL to inspect a specific Mainnet transaction\n– Reviews welcome ❤️",
