I would love to get some initial feedback from people passionate individuals prior to broadcasting it more widely.  My goal with this document was to be as terse as possible so it can be used as a center point for discussion.  If you aren't familiar with the details one or more of the points, feel free to ask me or check to see if it is explained in \u003chttps://notes.ethereum.org/Ck-KDLVaQgCHBMfeIhZTcQ\u003e.  I probably won't add more detail on any of the individual items, but if one of them isn't well documented elsewhere then I can work on improving external documentation.\n\nI'm mostly interested to hear if:\n1. I'm missing any Pros or Cons on any of the options.\n2. I'm missing any viable options.\n3. My terseness is so terse that it is just nonsensical, even to someone who understands most of this stuff.\n\ncc \u003c@!364458974906548225\u003e \u003c@!543900561460822016\u003e \u003c@!403707149043105803\u003e for first set of 👀",

It seems like we could improve things a little by either using the minimum *width* necessary to encode all of the possible type indices **or** define unions as: `Union[Type0, Type1, Type2, max_types=xxx]` and derive the minimum width from the `max_types` parameter.    1) I would be happy to code up a PR to update the spec with one of these options (preference towards the `max_types` approach) and 2) it seems like this is a place where changing the spec at this stage is acceptable as I'm unaware of any current usage of the existing `Union` type *and* the `max_types` approach allows for some form of backwards compatibility.",
