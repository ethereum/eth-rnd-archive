I'd be fine with \"Tentatively Reserved\". Thoughts? \n\nIf that SGTY, I think it would make sense to open a PR against the eth1.0-specs repo and add it to the ACD agenda for this Friday so folks are aware of it and have the chance to chime in.",

IMO, we can drop references to EIP-3074 in the tx list until it is scheduled for a hard fork. If something else comes along and takes `0x03`, not hard at all to switch to `0x04`... OTOH, `0x03` and `3074` are kinda nice - so maybe tentatively reserved is in our best interest 🙂",
