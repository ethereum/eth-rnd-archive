All of SSZ / typed-transactions / light-clients / log-reform are kinda one bucket, and some form of consolidation would probably help.\nRight now, I think a cross-layer \"purified-web3\" would stick best, as all of it sort of relates to the notion of a trust-minimized / decrapified web3 API.\nThe canonical site right now is https://purified-web3.box with the latest activity on the linked Telegram. It would be great to have a working Telegram \u003c-\u003e Discord bridge for better visibility!\nI'm not sure if we need separate \u003c#1295427781722898505\u003e , \u003c#779922457631916064\u003e and \u003c#595701319793377299\u003e at this stage. Maybe \u003c#595701319793377299\u003e could remain its own thing, given its CL focus, but the rest can prob be merged.",
