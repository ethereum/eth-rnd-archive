        "content": "In EIP-6493, for EL only `StableContainer` is exchanged on the network, while the individual `Variant` are used for type safety within implementations.\n\nFor consensus data structures, the fork schedule determines which `Variant` is valid at any given time, e.g., there is only a single `BeaconState` variant valid for any given network topic. That's why I've promoted `Variant` to not be just for internal use, but also be exchangable over the network. \n\nSo, in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7495, now:\n- `StableContainer`: forward-compatible merkleization and serialization\n- `Variant`: forward-compatible merkleization (same as `StableContainer`), but compact type dependent serialization (similar to `Container`)\n\nThis enables to also use `StableContainer` in consensus without serialization overhead: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8439/files\nTransitioning consensus data structures to forward-compatible merkleization is good for applications that consume consensus merkle proofs, e.g., decentralized staking pools",
