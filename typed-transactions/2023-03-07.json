It'd be ideal if by the next ACDE (Mar 16), we could make a decision about the best path forward for the transaction formats. Not sure if this requires another SSZ breakout, but at the very least all the EL teams should try and review the docs linked by Etan above so we can have an informed discussion on ACDE 🙂 cc: \u003c@\u0026836981603216654336\u003e \u003c@\u0026652918665943056397\u003e \u003c@\u0026688101493978562687\u003e",
