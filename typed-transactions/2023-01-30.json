        "content": "Played a bit with \"single `Transaction` type with `Optional` fields.\n\nTwo issues:\n1. It is very awkward to determine what hashing method to use, especially given that some of the EIPs added fields into the middle. Logic becomes like \"if 1st and 3rd optional are set, use hashing type A; if 2nd is also set, use hashing type B\", and so on.\n2. When adding more fields to the `Transaction`, the overall `hash_tree_root` of existing tx changes, if the new fields insert sub trees of depth != 0.\n\nI withdraw the idea of \"single `Transaction` type with`Optional` fields\", but also want to explore \"single `Transaction` type without `Optional` fields\", just to try to kill the complexity of the onion. In any case, to address (2), it would involve legacy conversion helpers, similar to how any design needs to handle the keccak-hashed txes.",

        "content": "I guess the main disadvantage over Vitalik's proposal is the \"typical\" post-4844 tx (which has no blobs) will have an extra few bytes to indicate the empty blobVersionedHashes list, but this compresses easily.  \n\nOne other detail to clarify is how to network-encode a post-4844 tx with 0 blobs.  I guess it would still need to have a wrapper unless you give it a different tx type byte than one which contains blobs.",
