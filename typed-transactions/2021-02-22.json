I'm still getting that the EIP-2930 access list is slightly more expensive when including the gas changes to SSTORE but am most likely missing something still, would be nice to trace a token xfer on yolo w/ and w/o an access list to get an idea of what I'm missing.  Time permitting I'll try to deploy a token contract there later today if no one else has already.\n\nedit: I deployed a copy of the WETH contract to 0xaba8241bced7c326887657fff0116042e0c763d7, figured it'd be useful to have an easy way to get tokens from yETH.",
