I think removing it from _all_ receipts as part of -6404 would probably be a bit too much scope creep for that EIP but since the 0x5 tx type in -4844 hasn't been fully accepted yet maybe that'd be a good middle ground?\n\nActually come to mention it, EIP-4844 doesn't actually specify the type 0x5 receipt format anywhere and probably should (e.g. -1559 includes `The EIP-2718 ReceiptPayload for this transaction is rlp([status, cumulative_transaction_gas_used, logs_bloom, logs])`).",
