In a block body for example, we enter the rlp list for the transactions, learning how many transactions there are, and then the next byte is either  `BEGIN_LIST` for a legacy tx OR it's the tx type byte which should essentially be tossed after learning what the type is and rlp decoding should pick up at the next byte, which, is a `BEGIN_LIST`, correct?",
