My understanding is \u003c@!135612611923279872\u003e is specifically looking for a way to know if a certain chain at a certain fork supports the `0x2` transaction type on `eth_sendRawTransaction`.  If that's the issue, one option instead of querying the provider would be to maintain a computer-readable document somewhere (say github) that enumerates what transaction types become available at what block number per chainId.  The plus side of this approach is it doesn't really require the clients to agree on a query format, the downside is it's maintained \"out of tree\" so can become stale.",
