        "content": "EIP-2930 related:\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on discounting addresses that are already added to the EIP-2929 access list (from, to, createAddr)? Right now, if I want to create an access list for elements I touch in `to` I have to pay the full `2300` even though that address is already included at the beginning of execution per EIP-2929. To keep EIP-2930 simple and continue allowing duplicates w/o allowing free calldata, \u003c@!415548822983278593\u003e had the idea to just reduce the cost of the first instance of each of the first 3 addresses to just 320 (cost of calldata). This could easily be track with 3 booleans that are flipped while calculating the EIP-2930 cost.",
