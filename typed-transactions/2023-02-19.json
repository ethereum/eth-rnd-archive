        "content": "Updated https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6404 \n- Updated to also include commitments to transaction signer, and to the address of newly deployed contracts, in the SSZ tree, to cover remaining JSON-RPC API use cases.\n- Pushed `chain_id` into the first layer of the `transactions_root` tree, as it becomes an `ExecutionPayload` property after transactions have been bundled.\n- Optimized SSZ tree to have shorter proofs for common use cases, added illustration\n- Optimized SSZ tree to have more compact encoding for non-blob transactions\n- Refactored EIP to have clear sections introducing each helper function\n- Updated rationale\n\nI'm still working on benchmarks, as discussed in the last SSZ breakout call.",
