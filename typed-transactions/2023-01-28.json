Captures the discussions well.\n\n– For SSZ there was one more point, that SSZ Container (and SSZ `Onion`) may want to include a maximum capacity that they can grow to (similar to SSZ `List`), to avoid situation where `GeneralizedIndex` breaks on every power of 2. e.g., `ExecutionPayloadHeader` could have 32 or 64 members max (and if we ever need more, could define an `additional_fields` field with yet another tree). Making indices stable across spec forks, essentially.\n\n– For SSZ `Optional` there may be a better serialization than `List[Foo, 1]`, here: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/1916 — I think, regarding merkleization, the `List[Foo, 1]` approach is alright.\n\n– `Onion` vs single `Transaction` type with `Optional` fields: The current TX could be represented as a single `Transaction` type. Question is, going forward, if we ever run into situation where new functionality cannot just be represented by extending with another `Optional`, should that be part of the same overall tree, or separate? `Onion` allows more flexibility for combining different concepts (and may have easier way for alternate network behaviour, e.g., `BlobTransaction`) / single `Transaction` has shorter SSZ proofs and may be overall easier to prove in popular zk schemes.\n\n– On undecided section, can also include the block / block header structure itself (removing the extra `block_hash` field in CL `ExecutionPayloadHeader`). `parent_hash` would still have 32 byte. block hash would no longer be keccak but instead HTR. \n\n– On cryptography, can we mix up `keccak256` and `SHA256` into same table? Not sure if they collide with each other, may need cryptoanalysis. Also re analysis if a collision attack is found on one of them.\n\n– The \"MPT of txs\" is essentially an \"MPT of txHashes\", having a `GeneralizedIndex` available that exposes the `txHash` could be useful to store extra, to allow proving non-HTR txHashes (future hashing algos?)\n\n– Byte swap precompile",
