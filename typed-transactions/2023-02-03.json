Even if the new field is left nil, this would cause the 4844 hash computation to change since the optional field would introduce a new leaf of merkelize(List[T, 1]).  Perhaps you can define TX_HASH_VERSION_EIP4844 to specifically SSZ.encode \"4844_view(tx)\" instead of \"tx\" (that is just SSZ-encode the Transaction as if all fields post-4844 don't exist)?",
