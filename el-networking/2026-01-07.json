We have a few options for that:\n1, have an ad-hoc call\n2, set up an EL networking call\n3, discuss it in one of the p2p networking calls\n4, sit down at interop and discuss\n\nMy preference is 2 and 4, but I'm open to other ideas. If you agree, I would set up a call on which we (preferably people from several interested EL teams) sync about topics, discuss some details and directions, and decide how we want to follow up.",
