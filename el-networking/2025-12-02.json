Not to be confused with the spase blobpool, which is EIP-8070, and I hope you all already heard about it.\n\n**EIP-8077 eth/nonce - Announce Transactions with Nonce** (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-8077.md):\nthe goal here is to  improve mempool propagation by adding each transaction's source address and nonce to the devp2p announce message (currently txhash, type, and size only).\nI feel we are already suffering from having only limited info when scheduling pulls, and this will get much worse as we scale mempool capacity and nodes start to have partial views.",

Even if we change only a few bytes, the whole content is ristributed again. The core idea is to expose vhashes and use these to avoid the extra traffic.",
