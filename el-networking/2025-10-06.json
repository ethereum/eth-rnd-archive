        "content": "Hi EL teams. As anticipated some time ago, we've created this el-networking channel to have a dedicated space to discuss ... guess what: el networking 🙂 . \n(original message at https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/688075293562503241/1405833836691980451)\n\nTopics of interest that I'm aware of:\n\n1) ** EL discovery,** improvements, improvement proposals, etc. (we have done a few changes recently in Geth and plan to do more ... maybe worth sharing experiences and syncing. there is also the question of discv5 vs discv4)\n\n2) **devp2p improvements**: there have been new versions, but adaptation is still low.\nThere are also some new areas we are exploring:\n- improving dial success rates: some type of peer filtering/scoring ... without risking network partitioning\n- improving pull performance: extending announcements with sender address and nonce\n- adding cell-level bitmaps and partial pull\n- proposals to separate type3 tx from sidecar are also in the works\n\n\n3)** mempool partial diffusion**: we have various sharding and partial diffusion related proposals in the pipeline. These are becoming increasingly important now that we start scaling mempool capacity agressively.\n\nTagging all those who reacted to the previous post \n\u003c@857052906495017000\u003e , \u003c@194432762315407360\u003e, \u003c@1057495364564946944\u003e, \u003c@741651225576996935\u003e, \u003c@277500722655002624\u003e, \u003c@795439202732867594\u003e , \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e, \u003c@597504466337398784\u003e , \u003c@199561711278227457\u003e \nIdeally, we would need an interested dev, also a point of contact, from each EL team. If you know who they are, please tag them here.",
