My initial version is: \n- v5 support by Jan 15, 2026 \n- **v5 on** by default  by Jan 31, 2026 (obviously one can have it on well before the deadline)\n- **v4 off** by default on main branch and in releases after March 31, 2026\n\nAny thoughts on this timeline? From the Geth side we only miss the last step, and we could do it any time, so I'm curios what others think here\n\u003c@277500722655002624\u003e \u003c@654267572107083777\u003e \u003c@741651225576996935\u003e \u003c@194432762315407360\u003e",
