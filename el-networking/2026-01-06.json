Slow, because we are doing random search over many peers, searching for a few, and a large part of these are already full.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I'm planning to introduce a devp2p-level peer exchange mechanism to speed up small network discovery performance. I plan to prototype this sometimes this month, then we can see if it helps with devnets/testnets.",

No protocol modification needed, just fast walk like in my crawler.\n- there is now people working on topic index again.  If other clients are interested as well, we can move faster  🙂\n- i would like to add a peer exchange extension. Planning to do this for a while, but I haven't got to implement it yet",
