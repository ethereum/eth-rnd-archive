You can discard any state before the finalised epoch (teku does this when in prune mode now) and can discard any blocks prior to the week subjectivity period (can’t do this yet because clients don’t yet support syncing from a weak subjectivity snapshot but will need to move that way for security reasons). \n\nIn periods of non finalisation the disk required will grow and states grow gradually as more validators are added over time but it’s pretty stable generally and should be easily under 10Gb.",
