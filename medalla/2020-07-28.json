So let's say you created a wallet from a mnemonic:\n\n```\n$ ethdo wallet create --type=hd --mnemonic='abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about' --wallet=DepositToolWallet --walletpassphrase=secret\n```\n\nthen you can ask for information for a given account by supplying its path as the account specifier, for example:\n\n```\n$ ethdo account info --walletpassphrase=secret --verbose --account=DepositToolWallet/m/12381/3600/0/0/0\nUUID: 37af7413-f53e-4ec9-bab7-9f4a2fc2c6df\nPublic key: 0xb66b3b3d90189644a2cafdd4e4846b0e6a01f62afa5a310b253a41358d169e830eb39c919e0c1a55cc6450eff6b1c48a\nWithdrawal credentials: 0x0029ee6ea836c8e0b026e7c674288ae4eb38e944da19f1933964c8c5bfb17967\nPath: m/12381/3600/0/0/0\n```\n\nNote the UUID will change each time as it isn't persisted.\n\nThis should also work for the `validator info` command, although I don't have any HD-based validators so can't confirm it (plus I think we're out of functional testnets at the moment, anyway).",
