Adding TLS support to the API server is generally not a good practice because it moves the TLS certificate private key in-process. Plus you usually want a proxy for other reasons like DDOS protection. (re @kzg_ceremony_bot: \u003cparithosh\u003e [reply]: You'd also use Nginx for SSL termination, so you'd need it to provide HTTPS connections to the sequencer.
