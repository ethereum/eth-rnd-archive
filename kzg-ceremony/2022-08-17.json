(re @kevaundray: It might make sense to also only require the first 100 people to  ping/pong or something like this? Because if there are 1000 people and each take a minute, then thats 16 hours I'll be waiting in the queue at position 1001, to which I might get kicked if I come offline.\n\nI'm thinking about worse case, though I think its not far fetched to imagine more than 1K people in the queue)",
