In case it is useful for you, here is the repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/zkparty/trusted-setup-api\n\nThe documentation is here:\n\nhttps://hub.apitree.com/NicoSerranoP/Trusted-Setup-API/\n\n\nI was using artillery.io to test the API with multiple requests and user flows. It is super useful and when we have the Rust coordinator finished I could help out setting up Artillery to test it :D",

Server is not implemented, but the crypto code is pretty much done with optimizations, benches and tests. (re @kevaundray: Skimmed the code, nice to see you also using axum 🙂 \n\nOne suggestion I'd say is to not directly have any curve related code in the coordinator crate like arb_fr. The coordinator only needs to care about the state transition from one state to another state. That state itself can be anything, as long as the coordinator can check the transition.\n\n\nSo something like this could be an interface:\n\n\nfn default_state() -\u003e State\nfn check_state_transition(current_state : State, new_state : State, witness : Witness) -\u003e bool\n\n\nWith that in mind, we can probably remove the part where the coordinator contributes first before launching the server, or maybe I'm misinterpretting that part?)",
