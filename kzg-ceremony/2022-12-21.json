I have written a mock authentication server, so you can test with it: https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony-sequencer/blob/master/tests/common/mock_auth_service.rs – with very little work (just write the main function) you can run it in a separate process. Moreover, I have a rather rich library of \"bots\" to interact with a running instance, here https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony-sequencer/blob/master/tests/common/participants.rs. In general, I believe you should be able to turn the integration testing framework I have created into a load testing framework with minimal effort code-wise. The tricky bit will be getting a predictable run env for these.",

They are really cautious about dependency count. (re @kzg_ceremony_bot: \u003cCPerezz.eth\u003e [reply]: Hey I wouldn't mind to help on the Zeroize stuff.
