Maybe only Github/EthAddrs are whitelisted for login and the flow is the same? \nOr maybe each _phase 2 contributor_ will have an upfront reserved slot or specially assigned token?\n\n[Context for my question: I'm helping a phase2 participant on using my client with some extra changes for his use-case. Maybe it will be useful for others too]",
