Had a few questions: \n\n- What is the canonical repo going to be, and how should we go about changes? -- Should we be placing PRs against the `zkparty/trusted-setup-frontend` repo, `main` branch? Who has permissions to merge on that repo?\n\n- Should we sync up with the other devs on the repo? (cc: \u003c@992497067878518875\u003e?) What are the remaining plans on this side, and how do we prevent stepping on each others toes?\n\n- Do we need the intl setup to be first focus, or are you okay with us addressing some of the other issues before tackling expansion of the intl setup? -- ie, copy updates to provide easy-to-understand instructions for users, mobile responsiveness?\n\n- Was there mention of an audit? If so, when is that and is there anything we should be aware of that needs addressing first related to this?\n\nWe put together a Notion board to try and organize the work Pablo and I foresee here \u003chttps://www.notion.so/efdn/Launch-KZG-Ceremony-site-1ea0ebfc142e4cb4977443781eeeb057\u003e (can DM with access issues) Please feel free to provide feedback on this and we can get going on things 🔥",

Geoff and I have permissions to merge\n\n2. We are publishing pending TODOs here: https://github.com/zkparty/trusted-setup-frontend/issues. We could use the assignation feature so we don't step on each other work. It would be great to publish some of the notion page comments in the Issues section depending on priority.\n\n3. Audit should start on Nov 7 (next week). In the frontend we have all the main logic and crypto code ready. Most of the issues are design related. And the IPFS deploy issue that we are currently working on.\n\n\nNice Notion page 😱😃 . I put some comments but it would be great to have a quick video call to organize. \u003c@420951281910284289\u003e \u003c@405860945018093609\u003e \u003c@786217377447804988\u003e should definitely be there 😊",
