The consequence of this is left to social consensus. Here it’s more of a case by case basis and we’d need to figure out why it was not included.\n\nThe first scenario seems kind of dire, but if the sequencer is indiscriminately rejecting contributions, then most likely there is something wrong with the implementation itself (re @kzg_ceremony_bot: \u003cTrent Van Epps\u003e https://twitter.com/bbuddha_xyz/status/1573877277213229058?s=21)",
