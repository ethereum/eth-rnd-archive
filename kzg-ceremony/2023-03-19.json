        "content": "Is this interpretation of the first trusted setup (2^12-1 degree one) accurate?\n\n1. We’ll start with 4095 G1 points from the setup, so we can create a 4095 degree polynomial per blob, which means we can chunk data into 4096 evaluations (points on the polynomial) and get a maximum of 4096x31 bytes of actual data per blob. \n\n2. With “full” danksharding each individual validator stores just 64 points on the polynomial and a _single_ multiproof (thanks to the 64 G2 points) that proves their points lie on the polynomial committed to? Thus you end up with 64 shards, since we need a group of 64 validators to come together to get 64x64=4096 distinct points on the polynomial to reconstruct?",
