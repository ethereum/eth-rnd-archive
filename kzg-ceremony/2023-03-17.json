There is a few implementations listed here: https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony#client-implementations. I wonder what's the procedure for being assigned a slot, and for our implementation to be added in the list (in the above link). Will you let the community know about the new implementations?",

Actually i wanted to learn wether all clients will be the listed in https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony#client-implementations. Should we do anything when we are ready? Any procedure that we should follow to announce our implementation?",
