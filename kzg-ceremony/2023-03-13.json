Some have large groups collectively generating entropy or particular setup restrictions which may need more time for computation. These contributions are were proposed by the community and funded through the KZG Grants Round.\n\nFollowing this period, we are considering reopening for one short additional open period, with additional sybil checks. Thanks everyone for being part of this project! 🙏",

So if we did the same number of G1 and G2 points, the ceremony would take much longer.\n\nBut more because we did an optimisation:\n\nIf you do a KZG commitment for a polynomial of degree n less than the m powers of tau you have, then you need to do a low degree proof to prove that the commitment is of degree n. We avoid the need for this by doing multiple setups of different sizes and we choose our polynomials to have n=m and if we need a larger m, we just choose the next largest m. To make this all doable, we only do the number of G1 points that we need for each m",
