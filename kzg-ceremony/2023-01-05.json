        "content": "I've finished the first version of my KZG ceremony client... I've contributed to the current sequencer, and things are looking fine.\n\nTo highlight here some feats apart from the obvious client contribution:\n- Allows verifying the powers of tau calculation from the currently provided transcript from the verifier. People could also use this client as a verification angle for the current transcript. I think it's a good offer to the community.\n- Apart from using CSRNG for secrets entropy, it supports two opt-in external sources of entropy: the drand network, and an arbitrary URL provided by the user. The latter was inspired by a talk with \u003c@686695036733227017\u003e  which is planning to contribute to the ceremony with cats entropy :). The idea is to provide a separate client to use your creative entropy source if you can at least offer it in a simple HTTP server endpoint. [I explain how this works in the README too]\n\nI put some reasonable effort into explaining this client and how to use it in the README targeted for users, so I'd appreciate it if anyone wants to give it a read and provide any feedback 😄 \nhttps://github.com/jsign/go-kzg-ceremony-client\n(I haven't shared in twitter yet; for now sharing here if something can be improved)",
