However, an equality check is never done to ensure post_state[n] == pre_state[n+1]. This is not right, diverges from the github spec's and will changed. The UpdateProof struct will now hold the post-state and the public key. The prestate will be passed in as an argument.\n\nFor reference, See this line: https://github.com/crate-crypto/ceremony-specs/blob/master/srs_updates.py#L17",
