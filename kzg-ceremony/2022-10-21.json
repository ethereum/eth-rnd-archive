(re @kevaundray: Meeting ended early. Since quite a few people were missing, I'll summarise. \n\n(Call was recorded, let me know who I should send it to)\n\nFrom the progress update: \n\n- Marcin: Double signing has been added using blst. Arkworks is not there as there is no hash_to_curve. Kev to send the link to the hash_to_curve impl for arkworks as its hidden in a test crate.\n\n- Greg: Ensured OpenAPI matches the specs now, also looking to add error codes so that clients can have a more fine-grained context on what happened.\n\n- Geoff, Chiali, Takamichi, Nicolas : Added double signing, but its using the javascript impl, so looking to switch to the one being used in the rust sequencer crypto code.\n\n- Kev: Pushed impl of CLI at devcon. Need to improve developer UX of it. Slow contribution times were because we were building in debug mode.\n\n- Nicolas: Noteed that Trent and himself were being stuck in the lobby. Marcin tested in live and it worked fine. Would be good to have better debugging tools to figure out what is happening. Kev noted that remco was looking into this\n\n\n---------\n\nMain question asked in the call that I think we should consolidate is \"What is the current timeline?\"\n\nI made a comment re one month, which seemed tenable from the current progress of those on the call, but noted that I needed to speak with Trent/Carl/Remco to see if I'm missing anything.)",
