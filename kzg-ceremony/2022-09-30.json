Points that are worth thinking about:\n\n1) are the correct things being signed\n2) does everyone have support for the `BLS_SIG_BLS12381G1_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_POP_` chiphersuite in their favourite BLS lib. (This is not the same one as ethereum is using as Pubkeys are in G2)\n3) @Recmo am I doing eip712 correctly\n4) Are there any safety issues anyone sees with what is being signed? (re @CarlBeek: The long-awaited double signing proposal is here: https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony-specs/pull/33\n\nIt looks like far more LOC changes than it really is due to lots of string manipulation for EIP712.)",
