He floated a couple of ways that a satellite could be involved: a single contribution, or run as sequencer for a period. Cost would depend on the complexity. It will be “under 6 figures”. They’re very open to negotiation and mutual PR opportunities. If there is interest, we can set up a call with them to discuss further.",
