Instead, we can explain to the user, what impact they will have on the Ethereum ecosystem, if they contribute honestly.\n\n2) There are two attestations for the ceremony that a contributor can make. The first is that they participated in a trusted setup and can be done once they’ve contributed (in the middle of the ceremony). The second is that their participation was included in the final output of the ceremony. This can only be done once the ceremony has completed. We want to incentivise users to come back and share the second attestation and we do this by only giving them the POAP at this stage.\n\n3) Currently in the designs a user can sign in with github/Ethereum and they will need to sign some message in the case of Ethereum. If they do not contribute, and come back again, we use cookies to ensure that they don’t need to sign some message again. \n\nWe can remove cookies by changing the workflow such that when a user signs in, they should be aware that they will immediately be placed into the queue to contribute. We can check if a user has contributed before by checking their ID in the “global” transcript. Noting from the last meeting about the transcript now including oAUTH IDs such as github/Ethereum.\n\n4) With DevCon fast approaching, we want an MVP design and not the final product that we are viewing on figma which will take a consider \u003cclipped message\u003e",
