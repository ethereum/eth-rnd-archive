This therefore allows one to use a polynomial commitment scheme (PCS)\n- The PCS that has been chosen is called KZG\n- This particular PCS requires a object with a particular structure, that everyone can refer to when proving/verifying; this object is known as the structured reference string (SRS)\n- This SRS needs to be generated by multiple people who do not collude for it to be deemed \"safe/secure\" to use.\n- The generation of the srs by multiple people is what we call the ceremony/trusted setup (re @kzg_ceremony_bot: \u003cTrent Van Epps\u003e i linked @Kev's document here, https://hackmd.io/@6iQDuIePQjyYBqDChYw_jg/SJ-08AoT5\n\nbut it only touches on ceremony \u003e\u003e SRS briefly. are there better resources that outline why 4844 requires a ceremony / how 4844 uses the SRSs?)",

(AFAIK no thought has gone into deterministic frontend builds)\n\n\u003e And will that site make the minimum number of requests to the coordinator to complete the transaction and no more?\n\nYep, though because there is a polling mechanism, not every contributor will make the same amount of requests. (I could poll the sequencer once, get the spot to contribute, contribute, then I am done. Or I could poll and only get the contribution spot after 10 minutes)",
