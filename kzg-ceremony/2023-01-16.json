This is not intended and should hopefully be fixed soon. \n\nRight now you need to make sure that your internet connection is very stable and that your computer never goes to sleep. I’ve also noticed that some browsers reduce activity if your screen is locked, so might be also worth it to keep the screen unlocked.\n\nBut IMO, the best would be to wait for the fix.",

I hope you'll contribute again when you have some free time. 👍 also good on you for checking that your contribution is included in the ceremony, these kinds of checks are important to verify the ceremony ran correctly.\n\nthe launch time was always set to 13:13 UTC on the 13th. I liked the meme of all the 13's. unfortunately this got lost in communication to a few people along the way and they excited started announcing \"ceremony start\" before that was actually the case",
