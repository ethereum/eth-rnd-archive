It looks like your browser is telling you that signinwithethereum.org is fake.\n\nWe are using the Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE) service to login to the sequencer easily and with most web3 EVM-compatible wallets. The service is trustworthy and you can check out their repo here: https://github.com/spruceid/siwe\n\nThe only idea I have is that you go directly to https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/ , click sign message and accept that signature in your wallet. Nothing more will happen because it does not know where to redirect you back. This might help your browser trust the website and allow you to go again to the ceremony.\n\nIf it does not work and you cannot use any other browser, then I can suggest you to use any of the other client implementations here: https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony#client-implementations\n\n\nPS: you could try with this browser implementation (it is a game): https://www.dogekzg.com/",
