        "content": "In the client I created for the ceremony, I created a separate `verify-transcript` command that pulls the transcript from the sequencer and do some checks to know if things are looking ok.\nIt validates that all the `potPubkeys` in the transcript (there's one per contribution), form a valid tau first power. This is done taking the `runningProducts` present in the transcript, and doing the pairing checks with all encrypted secrets from contribution.\n\nThat validation proves that the \"tau first power\" is indeed the multiplication of each contribution secret. With that, at least you're sure the first power is correctly calculated.\n\nAfter that, I double check that the rest of the powers are coherent with that taus first power, so t^2, t^3, ... etc are the correct powers of tau.\n\nIf you want to run the client `verify-transcript` yourself, it's quite easy, see -\u003e https://github.com/jsign/go-kzg-ceremony-client#verify-the-current-sequencer-transcript-ourselves",
