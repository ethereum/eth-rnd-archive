That `expire_contribution(...)` is called in these \"error situations\" where you won't be in the transcript.\n\nMaybe it can be useful if the ceremony webpage, when looking at contributions, can also lookup in the SQL table; so this situation of \"Is in the `contributors` table, but not in the transcript\" can show some message \"You got your turn, but no contribution was successful\" instead of not showing anything which could be confusing.",

How the bias plays into this depends on the interface you are using (for example, the hosted interface at `ceremony.ethereum.org` stretches then entropy to 384 bytes to ensure cryptographically small modulo bias). So depending on the interface you use, ideally at least ~255 bits, but more (may) help reduce bias.",
