On a computer connected to the internet, run the following command:\n\n`./cpp-kzg-ceremony-client --mode=internet --contribution-file-path=path/to/contribution.json`\n\n2. When the program tells you to move this file over to an airgapped machine, copy the file to an USB drive.\n3. Connect the USB drive to an airgapped machine and run the following command:\n\n`./cpp-kzg-ceremony-client --mode=airgapped --contribution-file-path=path/to/contribution.json`\n\n4. When instructed, enter your entropy and, if using the Ethereum authentication, sign your contribution.\n5. Finally, copy the file back to the internet-connected computer at the same location that it was initially written to and press enter. The program will now submit your contribution.\n\n\nThe setup is best suited for the special contribution period though since the manual steps of moving the file between the 2 PCs could take longer than the alloted time. The manual step also means that you can't just leave your computer until the end since you need to manually transfer the contribution file to the other computer.",
