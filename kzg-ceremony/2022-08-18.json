Our computation sounds feasible. The process would be: we build the computation for their ARM processor; work with them to test on the ground; then schedule a time to upload the code and data to run on the satellite. They have 1 cubesat up, and a couple more with better capabilities launching over the next few months. If this is of interest, I guess the next step would be to explore the commercials. (re @kzg_ceremony_bot: \u003cTrent Van Epps\u003e special contribution interest inbound to keep in mind for later\n\n\u003e Cryptosat.\n\u003e They launch satellites to run nodes in space.\n\u003e Barry mentioned that it might be interesting to have a satellite participate in the trusted setup for protodanksharding.)",

This will be added by the coordinator.\n\n3)  We looked over Chiali's wireframe and UI suggestions. Looks good.\n\nExpanding a bit more:\n\n1) SecBit have also decided to look over the Python implementation. This does not affect their original timeline.\n\n2) An example of this metadata is: \"Github: Kev\" or \"EthAddress: 0xdeadbeed\". If a user wants to contribute privately, they will need to create a dummy account on Github or a new Eth address with nonce \u003e 3 for example.\n\n3) It was noted that the UI may require more information from the coordinator, such as geolocation of contributors so that you can have a global map with all of the contributors . This and other extra information required by the contributor will be discussed in the meeting above",
