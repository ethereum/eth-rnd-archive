I have the impression that the lobby is not really a queue, but an open room where everyone sends contributions at regular intervals and if you're lucky enough you'll be included, is that right? \nThat would mean that if you leave and come back, with your browser, you don't actually \"lose\" your spot, you'll have the same odds of being included\n(I would like to onboard more people into the ceremony)",
