I'm trying all the different CLI-supporting tools and they all are having issues of one sort or another, some don't even build properly.  Surely someone else has gone down this route before.  I tried during the first open contribution phase and I got up until waiting in the lobby with the cpp-kzg-ceremony-client, but my contribution was never included in time, but now it fails to verify the transcript because it seems to encounter some json format checking error.  Using the firstparty browser client is not really an option due to the limited memory.",
