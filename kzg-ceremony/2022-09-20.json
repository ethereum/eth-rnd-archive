Apparently, the `ethereum` org is under an other gh billing model which prevents us from having public packages, so we're going to have to take another route here. (re @Recmo: @CarlBeek The repo is public, but the containers currently are not: https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony-sequencer/pkgs/container/kzg-ceremony-sequencer)",
