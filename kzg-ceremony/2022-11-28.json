You can specify a redirect URL of your implementation using `/auth/request_link?redirect_to=REDIRECT_URL`\n\n2. Signing with the external OIDC. After a successful login it should redirect back to the sequencer.\n\n3. The sequencer would take the external OIDC data and generate a sessionId. If a redirect URL was provided in step 1, it would redirect there. Remember that the sessionId should go in a Authorization Header: Bearer SESSION_ID\n\n\nYou may be using the data from step 2 and not the one from step 3 😊 (re @kzg_ceremony_bot: \u003cMariusVanDerWijden\u003e I always get `unknown session id` when trying with my own implementation.
