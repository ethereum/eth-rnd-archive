This method also allows us to deliver a POAP after the Ceremony.\",\n\nThe first part reads a bit awkwardly for me. Can we use the proper noun instead of It here?\n\n\u003e  \"p1\": \"This Trusted Setup is a multi-party ceremony designed to generate a secure SRS (structured reference string) to be used in the proto-danksharding protocol.
