        "content": "Hi, got a bit of a basic question. What happens at the end of the ceremony? How will the final output of the sequencer be verified? I suppose all it takes is one diligent participant to verify his contribution has been added to verify the integrity of the output. However if no participant verifies, what is stopping the sequencer from resetting the transcript and do few manual contribution with secrets it knows?  In reality this will never happen with this ceremony because of the vast amount of participants, but wondering how it works in general.",

        "content": "The sequencer keeps track of a _transcript_ of the ceremony, which contains all the \"encrypted\" secrets of each contribution. At the end of the ceremony, this transcript will stop changing and declared final.\n\n\u003e However if no participant verifies, what is stopping the sequencer from resetting the transcript and do few manual contribution with secrets it knows?\nIt takes at least 1 participant out of the ~80k ones to verify that the transcript is correct, and thus the final result contains its secret contribution.  The \"transcript is correct\" part means that all the calculations where made correctly, and that at least its own encrypted secret is part of the transcript (you know your encrypted secret, and also there're BLS signature support to verify third-parties encrypted secrets too). If no participant verifies (not even 1 out of 80k), then having a correct or incorrect result sounds indistinguishable.\n\nIf you're interested in checking the current live transcript, you can see an implementation in the client I created: https://github.com/jsign/go-kzg-ceremony-client#verify-the-current-sequencer-transcript \nRan it now with the ~80k contributions and takes less than a minute to validate all calculations in the transcript (common desktop machine)... it could be faster by doing some tricks for pairing verifications, but not sure makes that much sense if already takes less than a minute. I'm pretty sure there should be other \"transcript verification\" codes, so we should try to use as many of them as possible.",
