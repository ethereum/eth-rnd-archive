Our main concerns are with the server code with respects to things like DoS vectors, rather than the cryptography itself (I assumed that you were not able to assist here, but maybe I am wrong?) \n\nSECBIT did a formal audit of the rust cryptography code, we can send you a copy of the report if you want more context on what they were on the lookout for. I think @trent_vanepps was in the process of putting it in a publicly accessible place.\n\n@trent_vanepps , @CarlBeek and @Recmo what do you think?
