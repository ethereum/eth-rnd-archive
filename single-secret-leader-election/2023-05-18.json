But a naive implementation of the beacon chain already requires that to check if the pubkey of a deposit has been seen before or not. This addition will require clients to mantain cached set of k_commitment to avoid that loop if they choose. AFAIK spec should not be concerned with computational efficiency but correctness, and the current whisk spec new k_commitment to be unique.",
