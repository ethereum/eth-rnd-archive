If you missed it, here is the recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5HFO4DYckQ\n\nAs I mentioned there, the call is both a point to synthesise a few threads, and a place to project forward on what remains to be learned/decided. Going through the recording and the zoom chat, I tried to single out some of the questions/thoughts that emerged there. Will post them as threads below, and cc relevant parties to the discussion!",
