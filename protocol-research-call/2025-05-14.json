I think you were correct in recognizing that censorship resistance of inclusion is different from CR of state access, and there is a third axis that we didn't talk about which is privacy of state access and inclusion.  However, I'm not nearly as convinced as you that the problem of state access and privacy of state access and inclusion are actually solvable while scaling in the ways people want (more storage).  Almost none of the scaling proposals address them, and the few proposals I have heard of I don't think are technically possible using today's technology (like HME).",
