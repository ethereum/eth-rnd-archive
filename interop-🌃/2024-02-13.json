Normal tx pool always propagates so all nodes have more or less same information and same best txs, blob pool doesn't have to propagate so nodes have their fragmented , local view of best blob txs and not a global view. Thus they can accept replacement non-blov txs for the ones they don't know about. After they include them in blocks they invalidate blob txs on other nodes.",
