Why does the spec _always_ do verification of the block hash \u0026 versioned hashes in `verify_and_notify_new_payload` when the expectation is that this will be done by the EL? In Lighthouse we are currently only doing this verification when we're doing long-range sync and skipping sending `newPayload`.\n\n\u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.4.0-beta.2/specs/deneb/beacon-chain.md#modified-process_execution_payload\u003e",

We could also make the 16 cap be for total blob count, not tx count, but it gets a bit more complex. I'd wait out what happens and reevaluate based on that",
