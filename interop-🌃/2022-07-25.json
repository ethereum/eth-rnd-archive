        "content": "It would be safe to optimistically import transition block after receiving ACCEPTED if ACCEPTED meant \"All requisite data to execute this block are locally available\" which is not the same as \"I have all blocks and they constitute a well-formed chain\". It might almost always be the case but edge cases when EL can't re-create the parent state of ACCEPTED block while having all blocks available are still possible. Also, FC poisoning may happen with ACCEPTED but eventually INVALID block, this could be the case when obtaining parent state and executing a block in question takes decent amount of time and adversary is able to build a chain on top of this block with enough attestations to justify it.\n\nI thought all deep-state clients (including Nethermind) are executing blocks from side forks if they have a parent state, this is rather important enhancement which IMO every EL should be featured with, especially, if it's cheap. And I am glad that Erigon came up with a similar mechanism 👍  I am also glad that we caught this up in one of the shadow forks, great work everyone 💪",
