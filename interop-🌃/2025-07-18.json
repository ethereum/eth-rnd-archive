You can configure it to do a few things:\n- Delay blob gossip\n- Propose equivocating blob sidecars\n- Propose conflicting blobs\nWe're yet to test the last two after refactoring + adding fulu support. But i set it up with Blob gossip delay for now. \n\nI added a delay of 3s, so it sort of witholds blobs for 3s. Seems like this is fine for the network sometimes, the rest of the times the slot is just orphaned. I'd have assumed that in such a small network a 3s delay is fine, am i wrong in the assumption? Are our overheads now too high that 1s before the attestation deadline is basically too late?",
