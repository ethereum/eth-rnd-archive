If an EC is taking say 13 seconds to execute a block and gets another `newPayload` + fcu combo from the CL.\n1) will it try executing this new block immediately?\n2) will it abort validation of the previous long block or continue in the background? \n3) do all EC behave the same way? Or is it specified how they have to behave in this scenario?",
