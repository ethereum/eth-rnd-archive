For us we made the decision that blob transactions can only be replaced if both the gasFeePerGas and the BlobDataGas gets a bump (10% and 100% afaik). The current hive tests require the node to accept blob transactions that only have a gasFeePerGas bump with the BlobDataGas staying the same. But I think Mario is fixing that already",
