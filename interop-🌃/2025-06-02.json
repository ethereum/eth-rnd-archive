Preferably, it should not depend on additional actions from validators to function correctly—such as requiring a specific flag for node operators with a high validator count.\n\nAs an implementer, I am perfectly fine with the current state of the specification.\nHowever, I want to ensure that no unexpected behavior from **honest** large node operators (who are the ones most affected by validator custody) could jeopardize the stability of the network.\n\n**If validator custody is NOT mandatory or important for the network**, I’m completely fine with leaving its implementation up to the discretion of CL devs.",
