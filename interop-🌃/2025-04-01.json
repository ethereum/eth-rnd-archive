In Besu's case all validators are \"online\" though there are occasional orphaned blocks on our lighthouse node. \nAccording to \u003c@808969530608451584\u003e 's explanation, the offline number could be related to attestation performance:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1345173720578265088/1345174516938313761\n\nIn our case, it seems to be related to the client choice/config as we have the same setup for our teku node which is performing well AFAICT.",
