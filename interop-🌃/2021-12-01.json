        "content": "Perfect, those are working for me - I must have been looking at the wrong inventory or read it wrong.  It looks like the ee-endpoint the option is coming out as `----Xee-endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:8545` which has four `-` at the start instead of two.  So we're running completely in optimistic sync mode.  And since it's an unrecognised option after the `--eth1-endpoints` so is being treated as a second eth1 endpoint which is why we're not hearing anything about an invalid option but are getting strange logs saying eth1-endpoint 2 is invalid.\n\nI haven't been able to find the docker-compose file that configures this to fix it manually, but not sure if a new ansible run is the best option anyway.",

Firstly there was a teku misconfiguration and when that was fixed it essentially tried to get nethermind to do an optimistic sync and it doesn't seem to have worked.  I've resync'd teku but Nethermind is now reporting the payload for beacon block `0xe5492fcc95c71b0a61edfd4243e83c664b7f2eaaab4b63687ee04b0725d4b41c` is invalid so Teku can't complete the sync.  That block is on the canonical chain (and I'm assuming was accepted by other nethermind instances unless they've all dropped off).\nAnd the block explorer has gone down for me again.",
