Since March 27th Prysm has a bursts of context deadline errors in the validator client that causes failures in submitting selection proofs. It usually lasts for ~30 seconds and then resolves itself. There are no errors on the beacon node side. Initially I thought it might be because of very late blocks, but it did not happen on Holesky pre-Electra, which makes me think Prysm has an Electra bug. Are any other clients seeing this?",
