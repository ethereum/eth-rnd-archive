The spec lacks tests where validator balances are below the MaxEB, before the MaxEB increase it was the edge case but now it becomes a common situation. I guess lodestar would fail to compute proposer index in the network where validators' EB is around 17 ETH and the set is small enough to make the loop iterate more than one time over the entire set",
