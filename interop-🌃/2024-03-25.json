Seems like most clients need a recompiled image for this to work, we'd probably add support on the `ethpandaops/` docker images for this. \n\nIt does seem like some clients don't yet support the `ELECTRA_FORK_EPOCH` field in `config.yaml` (and throw errors if its specified). There's a PR to add the field to the canonical config: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3632\n\nIt'd be great if clients can add support for the field, as our entire testing stack would move to including the field (Albeit set to activate at infinity by default).",
