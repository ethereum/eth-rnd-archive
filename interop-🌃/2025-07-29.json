Add a `SLOT_DURATION_MS` or similar that determines the full duration of the slot.  (This should be config)\n4. Ship different configs for mainnet and minimal, epbs etc that have different numerators for the different duties, these can be changed by just reading the config file rather than recompilation. \n\nThis allows to tweak internal duties on testing by passing different configs, while at the same time allows to keep the current workflow of changing a single value, which is the total slot duration while keeping the same exact slot distribution in kurtosis. \ncc \u003c@654267572107083777\u003e",

System contracts by address were not stable.",

Nothing else in ethereum uses that, and since I don't want eth_config to introduce another RLP stream to encode/decode, the utility of the hash quickly evaporated.  The panda ops team already does automated json diffing, so the main need (detecting differerences) is fulfilled.  A config hash could return in a future revision, but it is not essential to the value it currently provides. Nice, but not nice enough to cause friction.",
