        "content": "Q re getBlobsV2/V3 and metrics - in relation to https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/674 for moving partial response behavior to getBlobsV3 - will getBlobsV2 and getBlobsV3 use the same metrics?\nSpecifically for `execution_engine_getblobs_available_total`  - once V2 is no longer returning partial responses, should this counter still be incremented with how many are available in the pool, even if null is returned? Or should it be all or nothing, in line with the response?\nIf context is helpful, PR for getBlobsV3 for besu https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/8967 - initial impl with the all or nothing approach. \ncc \u003c@1351272205555863614\u003e  - also posted this question on execution-metrics PR https://github.com/ethereum/execution-metrics/pull/2",

        "content": "I think `execution_engine_getblobs_available_total` could still be a useful metric for GetBlobsV2 in few ways, ,e.g. it could be used to calculate how many blobs were available upon failure on average; `(available_total - (requested_total * hit_ratio)) / miss_total`.\n\nIt'd be nice if we have the same metrics for getBlobsV3 as well if we were to implement it for Fusaka. In addition to existing ones, another metric called something like `execution_engine_getblobs_partial_hit_total` would be very helpful in distinguishing between complete and partial hit returns.",
