Some clients don't seem to work for me. For now I've examined only Prysm BN, in which I get:\n```\n  Caused by: Unexpected error occurred starting service 'cl-1-prysm-geth'\n  Caused by: An error occurred starting the user service container for user service with UUID 'dc9434beec66495f9ab8395b47527aa4'\n  Caused by: An error occurred checking if container '6220b045757b12ef3f48175b62a21bdfe9f0fa0efcd9b37f0265bfe1ece4846d' is running\n  Caused by: Container '6220b045757b12ef3f48175b62a21bdfe9f0fa0efcd9b37f0265bfe1ece4846d' (with image 'docker.ethquokkaops.io/dh/ethpandaops/prysm-beacon-chain:fusaka-devnet-3') die with a non zero exit code rapidly after it was started. This likely indicates a misconfiguration with how the container was started. Container should either exit gracefully or keep running for Kurtosis to consider it in a good state; logs are below:\n  --------------------- CONTAINER LOGS -----------------------\n  sh: 1: exec: /beacon-chain: not found\n  ------------------- END CONTAINER LOGS --------------------\n```",
