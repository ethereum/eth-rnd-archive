        "content": "Follow up on yesterdays chat about deposit testing on devnet-4. Ideally, we should run two tests:\n1) Same as on devnet-3: a lot of top-ups (~10k), this test should highlight the computational load spikes during epoch processing due to re-hashing the entire queue (if any spikes will be related to that). It is important to leave sig verification aside as it will affect the measurements, this is why top-ups are important.\n2) A lot of new deposits (~1k could be enough but 10k would be even better) to see how the rate limiting introduced by the deposit queue handles computational complexity.\n\nThe above scenarios should be run separately. Also, we noticed an impact of blocks full of deposits on the block propagation time previously which looks quite odd as those deposits were top-ups. It would be important to see if the same effect repeats and attempt to investigate into it with client teams. cc \u003c@808969530608451584\u003e \u003c@199561711278227457\u003e \u003c@412614104222531604\u003e Let me know if I can help with anything regarding these tests",
