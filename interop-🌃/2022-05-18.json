LH has it set to the head block, as per some old specifications.\n\nMy understanding is that the \"safe head\" was something that the research team *thought* they had figured out but then it turned to be more complex than originally considered.\n\nMy feeling is that if we're communicating something to be \"safe\" and we don't have a definition of what \"safe\" means, then we should use the finalized checkpoint. cc \u003c@425572898787426305\u003e",
