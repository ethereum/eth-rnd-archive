But I/we (Erigon) have taken the liberty for it to also mean that the EL is just busy doing something else (maybe a background process or housekeeping), and may need a second to be fully ready to build the block. My assumption is, \"SYNCING\" should be followed up with another block-building request, within maybe half a second or so. What do you think?",
