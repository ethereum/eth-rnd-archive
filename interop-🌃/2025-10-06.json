We recommend to support the `/eth/v2/builder/blinded_blocks` post Fulu to allow all relays time to implement and deploy it. \nThis can be tested with Sepolia and Hoodi testnets too where flashbots and other relay providers run their infra. \nThe API itself is fork independent but we recommend to start using it after Fusaka fork. \nAlso note that, relays will be still supporting the v1 API post Fusaka and the API will be removed in glamsterdam. So if in case there are any issues in testing with relays or we generally feel less confident with the relay infra closer to mainnet, we can fallback to the v1 API. \nHaving said that, we have intimated the relays multiple times to get the v2 APIs implemented and it is in their best interest to implement it 🙂 \nWe do not recommend to use the v2 api in your stable releases since mev-boost too doesn't have a stable release with the v2 api",
