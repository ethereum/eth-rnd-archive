Ping me if you haven't gotten one. \n@client teams, the consensus-deployment-ansible/pithos-testnet/inventory/inventory.ini file contains the IPs for your client nodes, please do ssh in and have a look if things seem okay. \nIt would probably be easiest to: Check docker logs for bugs, reproduce/test fix on one of your own machines, let me know what to change and I can deploy the fix on these instances :)\nSSH keys specified here have been added, please ping me if you are unable to SSH (https://hackmd.io/E8YmjPprRie-bSFPEq4nKg?edit#)",
