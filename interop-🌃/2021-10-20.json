Will try that (re @ralxz: ---\nunrelated technical question:\nwhen i connect to the pithos bootnode it sends a devp2p GET_BLOCK_HEADERS request for block 434 to 0, so from the ttd block to genesis. on a fresh sync i don't have this data so i don't return a response, but if i have the data and return the 434 headers i immediately get a disconnect with USELESS_PEER. is the bootnode geth? been trying to track down why this would be happening, but would appreciate any insight.)",
