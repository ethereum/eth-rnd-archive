Tooling can be found here: https://withdrawal-mainnet-shadowfork-3.ethpandaops.io/\n\nWe have the following on the testnet:\n- Latest recommended release of clients\n- lined up bls changes\n- will exit a few with no bls changes applied \n- will deposit a few validators\n- we have mev_boost configured at a reasonable level\n- 2 builders on the network\n\nThere's fewer nodes than other shadowfork as we had some issues syncing a few nodes. But there are ~60k validators spread quite evenly on the available nodes.\n\nDo let me know if i should make some last minute changes 😄",
