This will require clients to mock an El and the testvectors include the El response. For Prysm this is very little to no work. And if other clients are in similar situations we would benefit a bit about this. There are situations that not only haven't been tested but we effectively know that we behave differently.",

But as you noticed, the issue here is more about the testvector formats. Even though Hive  could probably take care of some of these situations. With spectest kind of testvectors, we could easily create crazy like forks that would be very hard on hive (I am assuming) and we can debug failures locally instead of relying on Mario pinging us. If Lodestar can accomodate this easily that makes now two of us. I suspect all clients have this one way or another. And already knowing that we would react the same way to an INVALID block that is some reassurance.",
