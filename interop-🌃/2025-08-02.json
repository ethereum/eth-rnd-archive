It wasn't saying the newer blocks were `INVALID`, it wasn't \"resolving\" (Nimbus terminology) them at all due to a combination of parent/DA issues. So as far as it was concerned, it did have a `VALID` head, which was close (within 32 slots) to the expected slot from the clock/wall time. It therefore attempted to propose, which seems broadly correct. Not a bug.\n\nNow, how it got stuck to begin with was problematic, for its own reasons. But from its perspective the newer blocks effectively did not exist, which is fundamentally the correct approach for it to take",
