        "content": "Ah, we currently _accept_ them if they're signed with the Bellatrix fork version, queue them, and then never include them in blocks once Capella hits, because the Capella fork invalidates the signature check 😅 \n\nI guess the best option would be to pre-emptively verify execution changes against the Capella fork version if the current fork is still Bellatrix. That way we can queue address changes that are valid for inclusion in the lead up to the fork, and reject ones signed with the Bellatrix fork version.\n\nTools like `ethdo` would need to ensure they sign using the Capella fork version if the current epoch is still Bellatrix, does that sound OK from your side \u003c@144468805697929216\u003e?\n\nFor later forks we'll need to sign with the current fork version (rather than always Capella). And we'll have a similar problem where messages signed for fork `n` get invalidated once fork `n + 1` kicks in. This is a problem unique to `BlsToExecutionChange`, because the other operations like slashings and exits have a slot/epoch field that enables validation across fork boundaries.\n\nActually thinking about it more this queueing behaviour might be a pain, because we have to modify the P2P gossip conditions to include the logic for verifying with the fork from `min(current_epoch, CAPELLA_FORK_EPOCH)`. It might be simpler just to ban `BlsToExecutionChange`s before the Capella fork kicks in.",

        "content": "I'm not sure what's the robust way of dealing with this honestly. On the one hand I do want to give users the option of storing before the fork a precooked list of changes that they can save on a file and distribute to pools for example for those that are racing against hackers. On the other hand putting in the pool a change that may be invalid by the time is packed makes the logic of removing it a little awkward. We currently remove from the pool when we see them included in blocks. Our own block would fail validation so we need to make sure that we remove them from the pool right there too and moreover it makes us check validity at block proposal time which is not optimal. I think the easiest most preformant is simply not include anything in the pool until Capella and then at each fork purge the pool",
