We prototyped it, and thanks to that, CLs could test it. We would like to have this prototype in the codebase. However, there is a conflict between the current withdrawal work and having this prototype. For example, withdrawal hive tests will fail after adding blockValue to getPayloadV2. Of course, the blockValue PR is still in the draft, so hive tests are correct.  Should we switch the prototype to getPayloadV3?",

If we decide, we will avoid the chaos with Engine API versioning.\n\nWe have the following options:\n1. Block value before Capella\ngetPayloadV2 - blockValue, getPayloadV3 - blockValue + withdrawals\n2. Block value as part of the Capella\ngetPayloadV2 - blockValue + withdrawals\n3. Block value after the Capella \ngetPayloadV2 - withdrawals, getPayloadV3 - blockValue + withdrawals\n\nSo in terms of API, the cleanest solution is number 2, but it means that we should adjust the spec and implementations. And hive tests for withdrawal devnets ASAP.\n1 - We won't be able to deliver it much ahead of Shanghai, so it doesn't make sense.\n3 - is fine, but it means that we will deliver blockValue later\n\nWhat do other teams think about it?",

Are the different clients going to implement a way to publish the change request or is it gonna be all up to ethdo to do that too?",
