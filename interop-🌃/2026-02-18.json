    "content": "<@1126229231572094976> for BAL benchmarkoor next steps, we'd need the following:\n- Images you want to test\n- Updated tests (the engine api changes, so benchmark tests would need to be regenerated afaik)\n\nOnce the two are done, we can add a run for it on benchmarkoor and get data. \n\nI guess given bal-devnet-3 would be soon, we wait on the devnet to go live before we do benchmarks? are all clients already aligned on the same optimisations?",
