E.g. information regarding which branch should be used, how the client can be launched with a merge-enabled local testnet, etc?\n\nthis actually came up on our Protocol Support call yesterday, and now with your mention of it, seems like something important to have before the start of the event.\n\n\u003c@!203220829473996800\u003e for ease of access, could something like a Notion board with cards fit well here? each client team can make updates on their own as milestones are reached. after the event, we can migrate it to a repo",
