        "content": "So erigon didn't finish syncing in time for the shadowfork, but i deployed it anyway in case it could fetch the missing state from the peers on the shadowfork itself. But that didn't work out. I finally got around to switching erigon back to mainnet, to let it finish syncing to head. My main reason was to sync it to head and take a snapshot on digital ocean. That way I can quickly restore it for future testnets and save us days of syncing time. \n\nIn the meantime, barnabas updated the erigon image. But since I made an ad-hoc change to erigon, he overwrote my state. There was an existing mainnet database for the beacon node that was now trying to sync to a testnet. Hence the panic on the beacon node. \n\nThe fix is easy, ill switch it back to mainnet so that erigon syncs. We shouldn't touch that node till its done snapshotting.",
