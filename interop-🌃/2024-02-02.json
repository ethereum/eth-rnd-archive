One aspect of this testnet is that the blobs start right from the genesis. Apparently, Geth ignores the blobGasUsed, excessBlobGas, and parentBeaconBlockRoot fields. In the case of the genesis, Geth don't include them at all in the RLP that it hash. Do we have a test that can verify on Hive that all clients behave the same way on a network that starts directly with Cancun?",
