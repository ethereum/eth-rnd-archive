In tests, as the mempool is identical and builders likely use standard Geth, I've noticed instances where the local bid equals the builder bid, leading Prysm to use the local block. Consequently, while the 'get header' part is tested, 'get payload' and 'submit blind block' remain untested. To address this, could we slightly increase the builder bid by adding a few more gwei each time? Not sure who to tag here, maybe \u003c@539495253418180618\u003e",
