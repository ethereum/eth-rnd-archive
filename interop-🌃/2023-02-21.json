Its currently still in bellatrix, we'll pick a transition epoch for shapella once the sepolia releases are out + some relays have had a chance to setup on there - we'll mainly use it for scenario testing. \n\ntooling link: https://ethstats.withdrawal-mainnet-shadowfork-2.ethpandaops.io/\n\nWe're still a bit light on tooling, it should be up soon.
