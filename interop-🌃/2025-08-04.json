Additional gas usage and larger block size had minimal impact on the bandwidth usage and max blob throughput.\n- Only `20 blobs/block with bandwidth limits under 22M gas usage` (100/50Mbps Supernode \u0026 50/25Mbps Fullnode)\n- Perfect PeerDAS (16 8-validator nodes uniquely custodying each column) achieved `60 blobs/block under 22M gas usage` \u0026 `30 blobs/block with bandwidth limits`\n- Genesis sync failed on Perfect PeerDAS network from Fulu epoch\n- Found an issue with Teku’s backfill, being fixed by Teku as per previous Discord. Waiting other CLs to support backfill",
