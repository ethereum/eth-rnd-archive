        "content": "ah interesting, so the genesis.ssz was generated with the `eth2-testnet-genesis` tool from proto. It sets the `previous_version` and `current_version` here: https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-testnet-genesis/blob/e6966a10f31b86a3222ef31c23f79ef3d62e7a8c/state.go#L28\n\ni.e, its setting `previous_version` always as the genesis forkID and we just never had more than 1 fork, so I guess we never came across a bug to change it. \n\nI can change this to have `previous_version` as the last fork, i.e  `altair`'s forkID in case the forks are happening at genesis. That should be a `phase0-\u003ealtair-\u003ebellatrix` as expected and keeps things clean. We would fix it in the the next relaunch of shandong, but other testnets can already have the fix in place. \n\nI am unsure why it didn't throw an error with other clients, perhaps they handle that field differently?",
