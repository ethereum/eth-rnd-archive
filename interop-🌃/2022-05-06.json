I'll reach out about client updates mid next week 🙂\n\nTTD is aimed for thursday ~4PM. We'd aim for a TTD ovveride on wednesday to keep things on track. \n\nTooling links(nodes are still syncing): \nhttps://ethstats.mainnetshadowfork4.ethdevops.io/\nhttps://beaconchain.mainnetshadowfork4.ethdevops.io/\nhttps://explorer.mainnetshadowfork4.ethdevops.io/\n\nIn order to collect more information, we were thinking of having a small `goerli-shadow-fork-5` next week as well. The idea is to try shadow merging gsf5 with pyrmont (which is deprecated). Since only the EF validators (~20%) of the network will join this shadow fork, we should theoretically inactivity leak the other 80% until we are able to finalize. That way we have EL and CL state and can reasonably test genesis sync on both sides. No idea how well this will work, but the idea is to just try it out. I will reuse the client versions from msf4 so there shouldn't be any increased load for client teams. More info on monday 🙂",
