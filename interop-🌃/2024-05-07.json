        "content": "There is a need of a quick resolution to the following issue:\n\nEL implementations return deposits in the list called `deposit_requests` in the Engine API (conformant with the Engine API spec). Seems like CL expects `deposit_receipts` instead (due to CL spec has not been updated with EIP-7685).\n\nThere is a need for a quick resolution to faciliate devnet-0 launch. Doing a proper renaming on CL side might involve more engineering (and even affects test format) thus there are two options: \n1) EL switches back to `deposit_receipts`, and then switches back again to `deposit_requests` (there is a PR to the Engine API, https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/544)\n2) CL marshals `deposit_receipts` as `deposit_requests` and after devnet-0 undergoes a full renaming\n\nThe question is Option 2 easy to do for CLs (to avoid ELs doing back and forth)?\n\u003c@\u0026836981489430036500\u003e \u003c@\u0026595681804422479873\u003e \u003c@\u0026595681771690000403\u003e \u003c@\u0026595683849225240704\u003e \u003c@\u0026595683609080365088\u003e \u003c@\u0026898338229407870986\u003e Please, thumbs up if Option 2 is fine with you and the change can be done relatively quick or thumbs down if not, any input is appreciated. Sorry for the last minute change and for tagging every team, I understand it might be annoying",
