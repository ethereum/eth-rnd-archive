We think that if we do a coordinated start of validators, we may finalize quickly before everyone is slashed. Because the number of slashings we can include on chain per slot is quite low. Each slashing needs a pair of attestations from slot 1 (fork day) and slot 2 (now), and it is quite unlikely to have multiple validators with the same slot 1 and slot 2. This is evidenced by the slashings we're seeing on chain recently, which usually only slash 1 or 2 indices. The most we saw was around 100 slashed indices in this block: \u003chttps://holesky.beaconcha.in/slot/3726835#attester-slashings\u003e",
