It was required to be supported with peer sampling, lossy sampling etc and it's not a strong requirement now. But we decided that some clients may want to have peer sampling etc. If we want to make it supported we should leave an ability to request finalized DataColumnSidecars by root in the spec like you propose. I'm neutral on this decision, beacuse we don't plan to do peer sampling",
