The Eth1Data should clearly just match the embedded ExecutionPayload, though exactly how to get the right set of deposits from the EL is still a bit unclear. In my dreams new deposits in a block are just reported back via the engine API but I'm avoiding thinking about it too much because I suspect there's some reason it won't work and then my dreams will be shattered...",
