Super creative to add these EIP numbers. The only downside is that you can't checksum the numbers (no lower/uppercase). I'd wonder who thought of adding the EIP numbers to the contract address? 🙂\n\nAh ok yes my memory is not mistaken. For EIP-4788 🙂 (Beacon block root in EVM). But that's actually deployed at `0x000F3df6D732807Ef1319fB7B8bB8522d0Beac02` so it has a similar pattern also. (I will stop flooding this channel now)",
