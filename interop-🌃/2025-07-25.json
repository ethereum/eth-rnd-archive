The log says it has taken it, but when I checked Dora, it didn't custody expected columns. Also, the peer_id I manually computed with the custom private key didn't match with the peer_id I requested via `eth/v1/node/identity`. Both methods worked on Grandine, Lighthouse and Prysm. It seems like Teku's still randomly generating its key despite the key is given. Could you check whether setting custom P2P private key is working?",
