One lodestar, two nimbus, one grandine. \n\nPrysm-besu can't seem to sync up. \nLodestar nethermind can't seem to sync up. \nTeku bootnode is also out of sync. \n\nI'd like to ask every client team to start digging into their machines and find out what the detailed issues are. I'm around all day, happy to give any assistance needed.",
