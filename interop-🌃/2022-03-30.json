        "content": "I think I have a deadlock on one of the goerli-shadow-fork-1 nodes between teku and geth. Geth starts a sync and syncs up to ~2 days ago. Then it doesn't know where to go next and stalls (since we don't have the headers for the last 2 days). We could restart the sync if we would get a newish header (since we could construct the header chain from it). Teku however only calls `eth_syncing` and determines that geth is still syncing (which it is), but doesn't feed us new headers.\nLogs from teku \n```\n14:13:57.171 WARN  - Eth1 service down for 9840s, retrying\n14:14:00.404 INFO  - Syncing     *** Target slot: 51945, Head slot: 34110, Remaining slots: 17835, Connected peers: 47\n14:14:12.405 INFO  - Syncing     *** Target slot: 51946, Head slot: 34110, Remaining slots: 17836, Connected peers: 47\n14:14:24.405 INFO  - Syncing     *** Target slot: 51947, Head slot: 34110, Remaining slots: 17837, Connected peers: 47\n14:14:27.171 WARN  - Eth1 service down for 9870s, retrying\n```",

        "content": "The calls to `eth_syncing` will be from the pre-merge deposit tracking code not the execution engine API usage.  That should stop if you remove the `--eth1-endpoint` option and the logs will be a lot less noisy as well.  We don't resend the same fCU call repeatedly so could it be that we're not sending anything because there are no new beacon blocks? Not sure how broken shadow fork 1 is at the moment.  Otherwise we should send a fCU at least every slot I thought.",
