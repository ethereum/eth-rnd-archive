(re @sigpaul: Hmm, it seems that the spec is a little unclear here.\nOn the one hand, the genesis block should have an all-zeros execution payload since we define the genesis block as:\ngenesis_block = BeaconBlock(state_root=hash_tree_root(genesis_state))\nOn the other hand, the BeaconState has the latest_execution_payload_header set to some initial values.\nSince LH is loading the genesis block from the DB to obtain the latest block hash, it's returning all-zeros. However, if it loaded the BeaconState and read the latest header it'd get a different value.\nI'm really starting to feel that the merge initialize_beacon_state_from_eth1 is a waste of time and we should just do the fork transition. There's less edge-cases and we get to test the fork more.)",

We use the same library for JSON and YAML and due to ints being strings in JSON we’ve had to set it up to always encode int as strings but accept int or string on decode.\nI did try to change the boot nodes to YAML in the testnet specs, so we don’t have inconsistent file formats. But it seems that battle was long lost.  \nI’ll see if I can make our testnet generator produce testnet dirs without the quirks. (re @arnetheduck: some small issues in the current testnet setup that we ran into when importing it:\n* nimbus needs to start from a phase0 genesis (we don't support starting from altair, yet presumably)\n* the format of the config.yaml is different than in the spec - it should use numbers and not strings\n* the format of the bootnode file should for historical reasons be .txt (and not boot_enr.yaml)\nnext testnet will start from phase0 (gracias!))",
