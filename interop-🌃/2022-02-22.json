        "content": "Maybe one useful clarification about the admittedly overloaded codenames/terminology here: there's already a kiln \"meta-spec\" (combination of CL, EL, and engine APIs, basically), which `devnet-4` uses. There's also a `kintsugi` meta-spec, which the `kintsugi` testnet uses. The meta-spec name and testnet name of `kintsugi` happen to overlap, and this will probably occur with `kiln` again once there's a longer-lived testnet, but when people refer to `kiln` in the present tense, it's largely that meta-spec.",
