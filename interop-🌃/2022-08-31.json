Client developers should fix me if I am wrong or missing anything\nComplexity that we currently have: \n* Pull blocks and deposit data from EL client via JSON-RPC\n* Keep the follow distance and cache the above data within the period\nCan be replaced with:\n* Have a logic that invalidates `Validator(pubkey, index)` cache entries on re-org -- potentially can be implemented in a couple of different ways\n\nWe should think a bit more on what alternatives we do have but as for now it looks like a reasonable trade off",
