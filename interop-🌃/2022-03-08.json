This causes warnings from Teku because the config doesn't match. And if the CL has had to resync then it wouldn't know the terminal block that was selected and so would always warn that the configuration was wrong.\n\nAm I wrong in my understanding that `TransitionConfigurationV1` should be returning the config (overrides) and not the chain state?",
