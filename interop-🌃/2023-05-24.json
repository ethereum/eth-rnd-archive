        "content": "So the following are the issues with their status and  concerns:\n\n1. [Fixed] Ethereumjs rejected the block which caused fork\n2. [Fixed] Nimbus was having issue serving blobs which it was fixed i think\n3. [Unknown] Failing sync from lighthouse nodes most probably rate limited, but i am not sure\n\nConcern:\n1. We moved past the blob availability window at one point, so the sync from genesis was not possible.\nHowever the last finalized was still in blob availability window when i tried the sync (and hence was able to sync till hitting the rate limiting issue) .\n\nBut now if one wants to sync from lighthouse, it wouldn't be unless leaking validators have been exited from lighthouse and its finalized (most likely). So a weak subjectivity sync from lighthouse should now work if lighthouse nodes are still up, but ELs would need to beacon sync which brings to the other concern:\n\n2. EL peering issue (if any) since ELs were not getting peered (most likely some config issue), and the beacon sync of the blobs which I am not sure if ELs were correctlty ssz serializing the blob txs in their payload bodies (however not an issue in devnet 6 since its RLP now)",
