However, if it loaded the BeaconState and read the latest header it'd get a different value.\nI'm really starting to feel that the merge initialize_beacon_state_from_eth1 is a waste of time and we should just do the fork transition. There's less edge-cases and we get to test the fork more. (re @dapplion: In M2 genesis contains execution payload so any finalized block contains an execution payload block hash)",
