This is kind of a bad hybrid between dynamic size like eth1, and 32 byte graffiti like in eth2. If you prepare an execution genesis config, and plan to start a consensus chain with merge at slot 0, then make sure you keep the extra-data short enough.

(re @vdWijden: It's not an issue with geth btw, it's a config option in the genesis, so nothing really to change on my end (other than the testvectors again))",

But will think about an adjustment \nIf you check block.number and its 0 and \u003e= TDD, does that work?\nEssentially, we need an end case for the recursion (re @sigpaul: Also, on a separate note, I notice the milstone tracker says\n\u003e run 1:1 devnet without transition (TTD == 0)\nWhen I ran against Geth this wouldn't work because:\n- If the EE is on the genesis block, there's no parent so get_pow_block_at_terminal_total_difficulty fails.\n- Even if there was a parent block, it wouldn't trigger genesis because the TD in Geth was static so I could never find a parent with a TD less than TTD.\nSo, to overcome this, I set TERMINAL_BLOCK_HASH to the genesis block in Geth.)",
