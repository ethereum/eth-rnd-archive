I wanted to start by first checking what all CLs have as their timeouts.\n\nSo questions:\n1. What is your timeout for engine_newPayloadv*?\n2. Whats the behaviour at 4s? if the block is not fully validated by 4s, do you attest on parent or do you wait for validation and then attest? Similar for blobs.",
