        "content": "The holesky shadowfork seems successful! We've tested the following:\n- Fulu/BPO1/BPO2 transition\n- 60M gas + blobs being between target/max the entire time (currently often hits 14+ blobs): gas cals seem coherant across clients\n- deposits, exits (with queues being full at the transition)\n\nFindings: \n- We're at 100% participation and proposals with all the releases from every client meant for holesky\n- besu sometimes built blocks with no txs, this seems to be shadowfork related and restart fixes it.\n- erigon had trouble peering, using trusted peers worked.\n- sync agg rates are mostly at 100%, some dips to ~80% and a few outliers that are lower. It could just be a side effect of such a small network (its just 6 nodes)\n\nare there any other tests we should prioritize doing today? any concerns client teams have for holesky? The network will be torn down in the next hour.",
