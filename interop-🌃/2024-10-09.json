        "content": "Besu has currently a bug with a transaction to an account that has a 7702 code delegation. Our gas calculation is off for a call and it seems that we consider an account cold that the other clients consider warm.\n\nThe 7702 spec has been changed a few times and I am not sure what it the latest spec that the clients are running on devnet-3. For other clients if a transaction has as the `to` field an account that has previously authorized code delegation, do you warm up the delegatee account when you retrieve the code for the transaction? Because in Besu we don't do that and I think it might explain the issue.",
