The following tests I think should be standard and I hope you are testing them (these can be Kurtosis):\n- Sending BLS to exec changes over P2P. \n- Sending deposits to the deposit contract post-Electra. \n- Trying to propose blocks with deposits post-Electra.\n- Anything that I am forgetting regarding eth1 data post Electra\n\nWe have spectests for these. But still it would be better to actually test these on a Kurtosis run with all clients than to trust each team's spectest runner.",
