        "content": "On a related note about reconstruction while syncing - say a node (full node or supernode) is syncing and it has peers covering the its column subnet except for a single column. \n\nWithout reconstruction it won't be able to continue syncing due to that column missing and keep trying getting the column to continue syncing. What I've seen in testing is that as that node is repetitively requesting columns from its peers without advancing, it will be kept in a loop until a new peer with desired column is found, resulting in unnecessary req/res. \n\nI think few CLs look at the peer’s column subnet when requesting column from peers and some don’t. It could be beneficial to the network to ignore sending data column requests when there’s not enough overlapping column subnet to cover the subnet required to continue syncing (or attempt reconstruction), and rather wait for other peers to get connected. what do you guys think?",

Take down one of each CL (or more) until we go below 66%. Leave as is for 1h (to start with) and then start them back to observe recovery from client bugs and simple failures.\n2. Rate limit 30% of the nw to 1mbps, basically they chaotically participate in the network\n3. Split network such that we have 2 chains, then heal them(Likely with tyler's chaos tool or \u003c@288990561279541248\u003e do you guys have some other ansible compatible way to do this with iptables or something?)\n\nWe'll start with 1 \u0026 if its healthy 2 today. 3 might be another day.
