It looks like nethermind applies the 4788 system-tx to the genesis block and geth does not.\n\nPer the current PR to 4788, I think that behavior is correct! I'm curious if there would be interest in making a special allowance for the genesis block to not apply system transactions? I am slightly in favor of this, because it seems a little intuitive that state root doesn't match the genesis alloc. We (at least geth?) also currently have no concept of \"running\" the genesis block. It's just read from the genesis.json and the state root is calculated directly from the alloc.\n\ntldr; my proposal is to update the spec to not apply system transactions on the genesis block",
