This means that they fail not because of invalid signatures, per https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.5.0-alpha.0/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#consolidations but because of other reasons, and it also means the `invalid_source_signature` and `invalid_target_signature` consolidation operations tests don't meaningfully test signature checking",
