We additionally had a mock relay running on the network and performed the following scenario tests:\n- take relay offline and assert local block production\n- trigger circuit breaker conditions of x missing blocks in a row/epoch\n- have relay serve invalid data\n\nThe circuit breaker was triggered as expected in clients with it implimented and the network continued to finalize. \n\nWe have 1 besu node with a worldstate issue, but that seems completely unrelated. Once that's triaged, I'd like to deprecate the testnet.",
