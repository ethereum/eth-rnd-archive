        "content": "I've been working on an optimisation to fetch blobs from the execution layer, and the results have been very encouraging so far (will share more on this soon).\n\nI would like to write a spec for a new engine API method to enable this, which requires a decision on how blobs should be identified in the request.\n\nIn my Reth prototype I used the blob's `txn_hash` because that's what Reth keys its blob pool on. However I realise that accessing this in the CL requires RLP parsing which is not ideal (I am using Reth libraries inside Lighthouse to do this, but don't want to make RLP-in-CL a requirement).\n\nTherefore my question to both EL and CL devs is, which key or keys would you support for the CL looking up blobs from the EL's in-memory blob pool?\n\n1. `kzg_commitment`: the 48-byte KZG commitment for the blob\n2. `versioned_hash`: the hashed and versioned KZG commitment\n\n(vote using reactions if you like, or comment below)\n\nThe request would be something like `engine_getBlobsFromPoolV1` with `params = [[VersionedHash]]` or `params = [[KZGCommitment]]` and a response of `[Optional[Blob]]`\n\nBackground:\n\n- Current LH impl: \u003chttps://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/5829\u003e\n- Reth impl: \u003chttps://github.com/michaelsproul/reth/pull/1\u003e\n- Discussion in the context of PeerDAS: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1247156108263555185/1247156110146928640",

        "content": "I would prefer 1 from Prysm's point of view as that is how we track blobs, but in the EL transactions have the versioned hashes as part of the transaction object while commitments are part of the sidecar. It may be easier for EL to check for transactions using the versioned hashes instead of commitments so I don't feel too strongly on whichever one.",
