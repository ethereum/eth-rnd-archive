    "content": "🐍  Introducing [Consensoor](https://github.com/ethpandaops/consensoor)- A Python Consensus Layer Client\n\n  I am excited to share consensoor, a brand new Python-based Ethereum consensus layer client! This is very much a work-in-progress, but it's already capable of participating in devnets. On its own 😂 \n\n  **What it can do**\n\n  Over the past week, we've (claude and me 😂 ) implemented:\n\n - Block production - Proposes blocks when assigned as proposer\n - Attestation production & aggregation - Creates and aggregates attestations with Electra format support\n - Sync committee contributions - Participates in sync committees\n - P2P networking - libp2p with gossipsub for block/attestation propagation\n - Engine API integration - Full EL communication (forkchoiceUpdated, getPayload, newPayload)\n - Checkpoint sync - Syncs state from upstream beacon node\n - Validator key loading - [EIP-2335](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335) keystore support\n - LevelDB persistence - Stores states and blocks across restarts\n - Beacon API - Implements subset of standard endpoints (enough for Dora compatibility)\n - Multi-fork support - Phase0 → Altair → Bellatrix → Capella → Deneb → Electra → Fulu → Gloas\n - WIP GLOAS/ePBS - Early implementation of [EIP-7732](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732) with SignedExecutionPayloadEnvelope broadcast\n - Prometheus metrics - For monitoring\n\nThe sad part: py-libp2p limitations 😢\n\n  Unfortunately, py-libp2p has significant interop issues with production clients. Gossipsub mesh management is unreliable - we've seen blocks\n  delivered inconsistently, causing fork divergence from other clients. The req/resp protocol works (Status, Ping, Metadata), but we can't rely on gossip alone for staying in sync.\n\n  This is a known limitation of the Python libp2p ecosystem and honestly not sure if there is any hot fixes for this. \n\n  Primary goal: Testing\n\n  This is NOT intended for testnets or mainnet. Performance is... let's say \"not great\" 🙃",
