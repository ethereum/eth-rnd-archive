Is there a reason client teams decide to push out an update so close to the mainnet fork date? I'd just prefer if client teams would be a bit more cautious regarding last minute releases, as they might introduce unexpected regression, that couldn't have been tested so close to the fork date. \n\nI understand that some bumps are minor, but its still a bit worrisome - from the testing point of view.  I'd much prefer to have these small fixes rolled out potentially once the fork transition is completed, that way we can be sure that the code tested with shadowforks and previous devnets is the code that will be rolled out on mainnet.",
