        "content": "Something to keep in mind for all clients: our Victoriametrics (prometheus) cluster was overwhelmed today from the devnet-4 load. The largest contributor was supernodes that have libp2p metrics based on `topic`. \n\nWith BPO's every 24h on this devnet each client was generating a fresh set of libp2p metrics with every BPO. It might make sense for clients to reset those metrics at the fork epoch? I imagine we'd see this with some users on mainnet if we queue up 3 BPO's at a time too",

        "content": "Hi, Sunnyside Labs published a fusaka-devnet-3 spec devnet report that was tested before devnet-4. We believe it can help predict fusaka-devnet-4 behavior once current issues are resolved and high-blob-load testing resumes. We hit 72 blobs/block peaks and sustained \u003e60 blobs (10-min avg) under 60 M gas, a 1-in-4 supernode ratio, and bandwidth caps. Instability appeared when full-node uplink (~25 Mbps) saturated, causing slower propagation, more attestation disagreement, and reorgs. GetBlobsV2 performance under heavy load varied by ELs.
