That is a deliberate choice\n\nDo you mind elaborating on the reasoning for that choice please? \n\nBesu does mark blockhashes as bad and skips re-validating them (until the client is restarted at least) and I can't find a good reason why that's the wrong thing to do. It is done on the assumption that once once a block is deemed INVALID, it is always INVALID.",

        "content": "Seems I was somewhat wrong about that. In the 'core' blockchain, we do have badblocks-tagging, and we do store it to disk, but never ever consult it ourselves during processing. So I was right about that. However, the beacon API module has it's own cache for bad blocks, to avoid re-validating already known 'bad' blocks, and I didn't know about that. The cache is pretty small, though, and apparently the idea was to actually sometimes revalidate them anyway and not be too strict about it. \n\nThe reasoning behind not caching bad blocks would be just what happened here: a (temporary) situation occurs, which marks a good block as bad. Later, after the situation has been resolved, the reputation of certain blocks lingers, and causes long-term problems / longer splits than necessary.",
