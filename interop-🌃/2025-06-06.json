        "content": "Hey all, for devnet-2 we have EIP-7907 included and on devnet-2 I want to ensure we can do the max-disk-read attack as described here https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1375206178199572562/1380433232281206894\n\nFor this, we need in the prestate of devnet-2 N contracts with unique bytecode (but all have the max code length of 256kb) at certain addresses (namely: those which could in practice be created by a CREATE2 factory). \n\nWhy do we need this in the prestate and can't we just deploy the contracts ourselves such that we can perform this DoS? Well - this is technically possible, but deploying contracts of 256kb will cost at least (but in practice more) `0x40000 * 200` (200 gas/byte deposit cost) = `52.428.800` i.e. more than 52M gas. Although maybe our gas limit is not that high it will be there in the future. The amount of contracts we can read from disk is VERY high, assuming 36M gas and 2600 gas to read this is 13846 contracts.\n\nWe should execute this attack to see what the impact is on clients, especially those who do not implement codeHash =\u003e codeSize index. This will also make us think if there are different ways on how we can solve this problem 🙂\n\nPandas, are you OK if I provide these addresses and the associated bytecode? 🙂",

        "content": "Nvm, I just realized that this would create a genesis file of a few GBs 😅 \n\nI think we should nevertheless perform this attack or maybe a shrunken-down version of the attack though 🤔 Anyone has thoughts on how to do this without providing genesis files of a few GBs? The attack contract could theoretically reach 13846 contracts assuming 36M gas limit (yes, we get tx gas limit but we can still fill the entire block with the attack, just split it over 2 txs) and 2600 gas per attack (this is too low, but will be approx this). So that would mean `13846 * 0x40000 / (1024*1024)` = 3425 MiB = 3.4 GiB 😅",
