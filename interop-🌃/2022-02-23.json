So `0x00 -\u003e 0x0`, `0x01 -\u003e 0x1` etc.  I'm unclear where the canonical encoding description for JSONRPC types is these days, but I think it's here: https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API (under `HEX value encoding`).\n\nedit: ok, I guess `0x0001` still becomes `0x1` so a more correct description of the rule is \"after removing any leading 0-value bytes remove the first leading zero if it exists of the hexadecimal representation\".",
