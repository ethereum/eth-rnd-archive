There are following states that block (and transactions in it) can be in the PoS network:\n- `latest` -- head block, may not yet be attested; non-trivial probability to be re-orged\n- `safe (justified)` -- block that has more than 2/3 votes; very unlikely to be re-orged (it would be an extreme case scenario); regularly is within `[32; 63]` range behind the head, with the improvement suggested by \u003c@755590043632140352\u003e  the range can be reduced to `[22; 54]`\n- `finalized` -- block that maintains accountable safety property which means that `1/3` of a stake must be slashed in order to re-org such block; regularly is within `[64; 95]` range behind the head\n\nThere is an idea to improve `safe` block algorithm over time to reduce its distance behind the head, ideally to `[0; 1]` range. The work on that is being in progress",

The work on that is being in progress\n\nThis blog post states:\n\n\u003e Post-merge, execution layer APIs (e.g. JSON RPC) will expose the safe head using a safe tag. Under normal network conditions the safe head and the actual tip of the chain will be equivalent (with safe head trailing only by a few seconds). Safe heads will be less likely to be reorged than the current proof of work latest blocks.\n\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer\n\nIs this blog overly optimistic in what was implemented for the merge?",
