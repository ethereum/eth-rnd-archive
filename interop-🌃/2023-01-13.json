Fill the pool of one client with 500K changes pre Capella. See if they're broadcasted and all clients fill their pools at the fork\n2. Fill the pool of all clients with the same 500K changes pre Capella. See that they don't explode and continue including changes (this may be impossible with Teku at least that bounds the pool, but still, fill it as much as possible)\n3. Fill the pool of each client with different 500K changes (so incompatible)\n4. Fill the pool of each client with 100K changes that complement each other. See that at the fork all clients have 500K changes (or their pool limits)\n\nDoes this belong to hive perhaps?",
