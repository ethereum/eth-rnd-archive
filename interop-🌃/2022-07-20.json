This means that existing users who understand the Prater+Goerli union can stay with `--network prater` and know they won't have their directory structure change under their feet now or in the future. New users, on the other hand, can just start using `--network goerli` and never know that Prater was ever a thing. It's also less work 🚀",

Some client teams are still testing fixes, so the shadow fork will stay around until that's done.",
