LH, Teku and Nimbus have perfect sync committee participation, Lodestar has 34.38% for each block and Prysm has 50%/75%/100% blocks. I have a fix for Prysm almost ready and it will definitely ship with the next release: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/pull/15608. The impact of our bug should be minimal on Mainnet, but I expect sync committee participation to improve slightly with this change because we might be missing aggregation opportunities. I can't speak for Lodestar.",
