Seems like all the clients made it through the shadowfork and the dencun fork without issues. \n\nWe have some basic blob txs in the network. There are no tx-spammers in the network, so all the transaction load is from goerli canonical. I'm running some validator exits to have more funds for blob spamming. I'll also start up xatu so we have some blob/block processing metrics. This means the data should showcase how goerli would perform if all we did was add blobs to the existing network.",
