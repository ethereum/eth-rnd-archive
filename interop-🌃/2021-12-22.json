SYNCING literally means that EL can't execute a payload due to missing data, or it doesn't have referenced block at all in the case of the `forkchoiceUpdated`.\n\nIn case of SYNCING CL may or may not enabled optimistic sync depending on the case. In case of communication error it must not enable optimistic sync mode and rather retry on executing the payload once again, queue it for later retry or just discard as it's been mentioned above. You may also signal a critical error to user as EL component is unreachable and it might require manual intervention",
