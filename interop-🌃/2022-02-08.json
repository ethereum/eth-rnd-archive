        "content": "Update: removed geth's dbase, restarted the node with the CL optimistically synced up to yesterday's head. Prysm catched up to head and triggered `forkChoiceUpdated`  which in turn sent geth to sync, and this time it synced quickly to head. So I do not know if the bug above getting stuck trying to send block 43943 to the freezer is a bug in geth or caused by a bug in prysm, but now I have a fully synced Kintsugi node",
