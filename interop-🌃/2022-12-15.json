The allowing public part I guess is the part up for debate. We could alternately host another internal devnet, just bigger and it'll still allow us to bug-hunt - this approach would of course make the public testnet more likely a stable success. But I do believe there's a decent need for the community to start getting involved with withdrawals. \n\nCL: spec `v1.3.0-alpha.2`\nEL: eip-4895 @ commit `0fa80ec`\nEngineAPI version? - TBD\nPR 314: getPayloadV2 in blockValue format : Yes, with 0 as a stub as a bare minimum.\nPR 146(add getPayloadBodies method) \u0026 PR 218(getPayloadBodiesByRangeV1) NOT required\nGenesis.json of EL has shanghaiTime as the field name\n\nOption 1.
