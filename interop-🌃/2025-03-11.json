While holesky is stable and can be used for a lot of tests, we need to discuss the location for tests it isnt suitable for. \n\nI proposed it as a topic on ACD this week: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1346#issuecomment-2715006052\n\nConsidering staking pool opinion weighs really highly on this decision, could we ask you all to engage on the topic, share the options, collect opinions and potentially even attend ACD to be included in the decision?",
