Supernodes will be fully exited, and 8 out of 12 validators will be exited for the full nodes. This will still leave a few validators around for when we can recover finality. \n\nIf this is insufficient, I'll take a look at the next long term non working clients, and exit them too. Will keep going till we dont reach finalization again.",
