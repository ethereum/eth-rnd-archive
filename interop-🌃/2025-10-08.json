        "content": "Currently, regarding `blobs` or `blob_sidecars` beacon API requests, Prysm operates in a “best effort” mode: it responds to these requests as long as it has at least 64 stored data column sidecars, and it reconstructs data when necessary. (However, as discussed a few months ago, it does not request sidecars from peers via P2P.)\n\nThe issue with this behavior is that Prysm’s ability to respond to `blobs` or `blob_sidecars` beacon API requests depends on:\n\n1. Whether the `--subscribe-all-data-subnets` flag is enabled (which is fine), or\n2. Whether the beacon node manages enough ETH to custody at least 64 columns.\n\nFrom a user perspective, point 2 feels somewhat unintuitive: the relationship between the amount of ETH managed and the ability to respond to beacon API requests isn’t immediately clear.\n\nWith the current implementation, responding to those requests when `cgc = 127` will take a lot more CPU than if `cgc = 128` (in case reconstruction is needed), which is hard to understand from a user perspective.\n\nI was wondering whether Prysm should restrict its ability to respond to `blobs` or `blob_sidecars` beacon API requests only when the `--subscribe-all-data-subnets` flag is used, to make the behavior more predictable, and more consistent regarding CPU usage (no reconstruction at all).\n\nWhat is the other CLs behavior regarding this question?",
