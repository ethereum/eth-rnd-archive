However looking at the tests the clients (go / ethjs / nethermind) are only failing at most 3/38 tests. Since these tests run blocks this implies that all these 3 clients are running system txs instead of calling into the contract at the start of each block. Suggestion: update the bytecode of the beacon root contract such that it is correct for both cases (both system txs and non-system txs in case that there is no bytecode at the contract)",
