The EL has full control over the gas limit, so we don't know what it is going to be at the point of the merge. If Cl clients expect it to be a certain value, they will be forked off. I'll set the gas limit in my docs/test vectors to 30M now (which also changes the genesis hash) in order to get this point settled. (re @kristofgazso: guys so what gaslimit are you using?\noriginally it was written 0x989680 but we some teams have been using 0x1C9C380)",
