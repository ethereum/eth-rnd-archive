I know there are a lot of missed slots but something seems off with how attestations are packed to me. I was also curious if that is that case on mainnet and I have not found a single attestation over the last 30 days for our Lido validators that had an attestation in aggregate but missed it.",

This represents a potential issue for mainnet, where this sort of attestation behaviour _should_ be considered an attack.\n\nI'm wondering if it's because we don't have enough slashers running. If people who were previously running slashers and shut them down have the capacity to restart them, it might be good to do that. For Lighthouse, you can run with `--slasher-broadcast false` so that the slashings are hoarded until after finalization. CC \u003c@592004585506340885\u003e I think EF security had/has a LH slasher?\n\nIf anyone running LH is struggling with mem, make sure you're running our latest `holesky-rescue` branch. We also have a fix incoming for disk usage. No docker images/releases yet though, coordinating these across a weekend with people going offline and having other commitments is a little tricky.",
