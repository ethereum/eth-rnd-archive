This lead to excessive load on the full nodes which were capped by the rate limiter. This lead to a skewed analysis. \n\nWe have nuked the db of all the full nodes that were ran by our team, and re-initialized it with the correct cgc values. We will try to do an expedited analysis again tomorrow.",
