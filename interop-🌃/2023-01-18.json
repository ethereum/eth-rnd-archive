The main reason for this, is that we want to avoid spending time on user support during the even (as rightfully pointed out by Paul). \n\nIn lieu of this, we'd like to keep withdrawal-devnet-3 up until the public testnet is out. We'd be doing a mainnet shadow fork next week, we can do some intense testing and fuzzing on that. Additionally we can do scenario testing, such as filling up BLS changes pre/post capella or non-finality during the fork, etc. This should also allow us to have more stable releases out for the public testnet. \n\nIn case someone is strongly against this approach, do let us know and we can re-plan things if needed.",
