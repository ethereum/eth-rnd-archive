IPs for nodes can be found here: https://github.com/parithosh/consensus-deployment-ansible/blob/master/merge-devnet-0/inventory/inventory.ini\nYou should have SSH access to the nodes that belong to your team. If not, reach out and i can configure it. Otherwise, configs to setup your own node can be found here: https://github.com/eth-clients/testnet-configs/tree/main/merge-testnets/merge-devnet-0\nThe chain is chaotic right now, so i guess setting up your own nodes would work better in a while.",
