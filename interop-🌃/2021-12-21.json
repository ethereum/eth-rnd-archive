I'd say pending validation is misleading because the EL isn't necessarily going to validate that block unless you send it again. It might, but the EL has a lot of freedom in how it syncs.\n\nFrom the CL perspective I could see pending validation being a reasonable term, though I still think it's a bit misleading - the block is partially validated, it's only the execution payload that hasn't been.  In teku we just call these optimistic blocks.",
