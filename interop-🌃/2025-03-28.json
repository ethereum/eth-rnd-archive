In both cases initially the keys loading was (slowly) working until it somehow interfered with the normal lighthouse operation. So the keys loading process got purposely aborted and lighthouse vc resumed its normal operation (so that blocks and attestations got back being timely signed and published). \nSo far erigon didn’t contribute to the above troubles, it was a suffering party.\nWe’ll be monitoring how things go on.",

I know its probably hard to allocate time on all CL teams for this right now, but maybe one or two have a devops person or someone outside of the critical path that can help? \n\nThe idea is to integrate it in the CI of client teams, get some insight on how helpful it is, potentially find bugs, etc.",
