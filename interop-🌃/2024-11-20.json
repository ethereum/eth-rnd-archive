There have been some scenarios suggested, so we'd likely just start off with the most urgent case first and continue with the others later on. \n\nTLDR:\n- cloud VMs, 8c/32GB/20mbps down \u0026 10mbps up, geo distributed\n- 1M validators, mainnet distribution, keep some keys for devs to run at home\n- 1d finalizing, 3d non-finality\n- fill it with blobs @ target and txs with eth_calls\n- Check if all client teams have metrics for it\n- generate a prometheus config to run at home and ship metrics to pandaops metrics server\n\nfuture versions:\n- v1 has even split of clients offline\n- retry with devnet-5 + increasing the blob count\n- with one client failing\n- with hydra\n- non-finality for 2 weeks",
