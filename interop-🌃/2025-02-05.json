I apologize if that's a thing which has been discussed already elsewhere.\n\nIt's not a matter of missed block, but a matter of attestations. My understanding is that the first block of Electra on Mainnet will have 0 attestations. Funnily enough, on devnet-6 this block was a Prysm block, and indeed it has 0 attestations: https://dora.pectra-devnet-6.ethpandaops.io/slot/320\n\nThe reason is that this block can contain only Electra attestations, but all attestations sent out by validators at the last slot of Deneb (or a previous slot) are Phase0 attestations and as such cannot be included in the block. One way to mitigate this would be to sent out Electra attestations at the last slot of Deneb, but this would also require updating attestation subnets to Electra before the last slot, otherwise they will be dropped and again the block will have 0 attestations.",
