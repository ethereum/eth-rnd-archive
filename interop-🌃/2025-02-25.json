We do not rollback justification if we declare a node to be invalid. This makes sense since anyway we do not want to attest or perform any duties in this scenario. But the problem is that if we launch a new EL and it syncs from a bad node, it syncs it optimistically and by the time it finds out it's invalid the justification stays. Is there anyway of marking ELs with prescribed hashes to be invalid?",
