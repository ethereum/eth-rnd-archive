        "content": "Hi all — I'm Minhyuk from Sunnyside.\nWith Fusaka rolling out to testnets and mainnet soon (very exciting), we’ve started looking at the next set of improvements that could help safely increase blob counts beyond the initial BPO schedules.\nOne area we’re focusing on is p2p propagation behavior across clients. In high-blob conditions, differences in how CLs schedule and prioritize gossip traffic could have a meaningful impact on head correctness and block propagation times. We’d like to explore incremental changes these p2p improvements and test those on our devnets going forward.\n\nHere’s an [initial xatu-based p2p analysis using devnet-5 data](https://testinprod.notion.site/Sunnyside-Devnet-Analysis-10-10-2858fc57f54680d2a700d4ee1f735587), and would love input - especially on the questions in the last section. This will help us better understand the client behaviors and shape the next rounds of devnet experiments. If you guys have any other ideas or improvements that you’d like to test, please let us know as well 🙂 \n\nThanks!",
