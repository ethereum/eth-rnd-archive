It was indeed in the genesis generator, but like 2 tools deeper 😅 \n\nThe minimal build has been fixed now: https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package/pull/871\n\nOpen issues:\n- Lighthouse still seems to fail, even on the latest v6.0.1 release to read the minimal state. It couldn't import state and failed to start. (Do we need a minimal image in lighthouse?)\n- Gandine fails with a forkchoice assertion failure `thread main panicked at /fork_choice_store/src/store.rs:227:9  assertion left == right failed` (We used the image `ethpandaops/grandine:develop-minimal`",
