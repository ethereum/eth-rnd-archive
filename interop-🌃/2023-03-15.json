Find a time that best suits you when you're not distracted and can spend a little time reading some documentation, You'll need an ethereum address that you can deposit funds to and definitely have control of... Make sure you still have the credentials for the ethereum address you're going to use, as the change is permanent for the validator.... etc .etc. \n\nThere's definitely the number of bls changes on the withdrawals page, but I suspect the size of the bls change queue is a little less easy to see... and querying the api isn't something I'd probably suggest non tech users play with as they'll just find it frustrating, so that's the part of the story im not sure how to articulate in a way that everyone will get and be appropriate for their client...",
