So it might be better to check if the payload is already in the chain \n(since we have blockhash and number in the payload) but there might be some security risk attached,\ne.g. by providing a payload with correct blockhash and number but invalid other parameters.\nGeth will check that the payload produces a correct blockhash before anything else so the improvement\nwould not be a problem for us, but might be for others. Curious what the other EL's think",
