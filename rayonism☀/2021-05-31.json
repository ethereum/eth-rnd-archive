The following is on the table now:\n- **Transition process.** We have design, we are currently working on the spec part, then transition process will be checked by multiple devnet rounds (local and probably public) then we can test it on the larger testnet.\n- **State sync.** This is what go-ethereum is working on. We're expecting to see it in this bigger testnet as well.\n- **Consensus API.** We have a JSON-RPC based API now that works, looking into production solution and Consensus API standard.\n- **Validator Withdrawals.** Are also in progress.\n\nThat's the main tracks of Merge efforts today.",
