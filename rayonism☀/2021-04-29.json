If people send their address I'll act as faucet and try to send some testnet eth via a transaction (if those work!). Maybe we get the faucet itself running, but the testnet itself is a bit short for full infrastructure.\n2) The intention is \"a day\", enough debugging time for clients to try it. Over the weekend I don't expect anyone to run nodes. I'll just keep mine running till the testnet falls over decisively, or if we have new plans. We'll organize some longer testnet once we're through initial testing (and inevitable bugs).\n3) Maybe. If someone likes to host a discv4 bootnodes, then add it to the repo. I'll add the addresses of my network-enabled eth1 nodes once they are up. Transaction-propagation is not the main thing to test yet.\n4) Yep, deposit transactions would be nice (any transactions and contract deployments are worth testing really)",

This is due to the deposit-legacy of mainnet, where it would first fetch all eth1 data, and only then start the network stack, wait the delay out, and start the chain. If you're an eth2 client dev, please review the activation trigger of your network stack.",
