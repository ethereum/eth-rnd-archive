Not for first devnet, but later on indexing of post-merge EVM transations in beaconcha.in would be amazing.\n- Genesis: We embed the deposit contract in genesis state. Pre-fill validator set. Try to keep the eth2 configuration as canonical as possible. We allocate some testnet ether, and can send it to users who want to be on the bleeding edge of first devnet, and help test.\n- In future testnets we could try make a faucet service\n- Eth1 follow distance is left unchanged, even though the deposit contract lives on the same chain, since we use the same eth1 voting as the phase0 and merge specs\n- We use the work-around approach of constant total-difficulty in the first devnet\n- We will experiment today with genesis configuration and document a devnet setup\n- No devnet launch date yet. Short-lived and dev-focused at first anyway. Target around first week of hackathon still.",
