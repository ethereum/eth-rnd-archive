I included an example configuration for the first devnet.\n\nWith the updated eth2-genesis tooling (https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-testnet-genesis), we can now prepare a BeaconState `genesis.ssz` ready for a post-merge testnet start (including eth1 state root, empty deposit tree, validator allocaiton, etc. preparation). This SSZ file is for the very latest merge beacon spec (will merge tomorrow in eth2 specs repo). Now we have to focus on client readiness (implement prototype RPC), and we can possibly try a small shared merge devnet next week!\n\nOffice hour call in 25 min",
