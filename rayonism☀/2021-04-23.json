Will use Catalyst (Geth) during next month though.\n- Nethermind and Lighthouse part of mergenet-tutorial now\n- Prysm handling encoding issue, has open PR, ready for testnet too\n- Testnet plan: 1 day testnet first, test interop. Proto will distribute keystores to client devs and prepare a testnet config/genesis (mainnet-like config, 16k validators). Proto will try to host a stable main deployment (~10 nodes, ~2/3 validators), remaining keystores can be used for block-proposal testing by client devs. Connect nodes on Monday, start chain on Tuesday.",
