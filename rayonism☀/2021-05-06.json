They could share block, receipt and state database (with each having their own block tree, thus head, thus state root). One more thing to extend would be transaction pool which can be shared only partially, but that's not that big of a deal.\n\nThe only problem if eth2 clients would branch a lot our Databases would be bigger than in 1:1 to accomodate all the variations.",
