Teku is up-to-date with spec, but still in testing against the updated Catalyst, latest work is here: https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/compare/master...txrx-research:rayonism-merge\nMikhail and me will be working on the devnet setup next week, we have the setup with keystores + custom eth1/eth2 configuration working, but need to document running of the clients more + test deposits. See https://notes.ethereum.org/@protolambda/merge-devnet-setup-guide for info how to configure one yourself. \nPrysm is working on updating to latest spec as well, and you may be able to run that later next week.",
