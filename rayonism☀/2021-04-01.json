        "content": "Applicaiton-layer network stack will be also responsible for retrieving the chain history as it is today. Moving this responsibility to the consensus-layer would require additional API between consensus and application layers which would allow to grab a headers, bodies and receipts upon requests from the wire. Then the reasonable question is, why do we even need the application chain to exists and the answer is existing JSON-RPC API and history and chain structure invariants. This all is a big chunk of research and experiments.\n\nI would not start working on moving transaction pool from devp2p (app) to libp2p (consensus) if there are no further plans and possibilities to get rid of app-layer network stack at all. This all would be really great and that was originally discussed in the merge context. But apparently have a big scope of work to be done.",
