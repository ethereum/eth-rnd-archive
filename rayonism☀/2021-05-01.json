Now it's time for spec testing + work on sync stability + improved beacon/validator setups to get ready for to the next devnet. We'll soon update the merge-tutorial with an automated local testnet setup, and make a specs alpha-release with Merge test vectors.",

We could put that in docker, but we need it to be customizable, not a black box. Hence also all the instructions to build and run from source, so people can tweak things. Maybe there's some balance with configs you can mount, and a dockerfile that documents the  process? You're welcome to make PRs with your ideas",
