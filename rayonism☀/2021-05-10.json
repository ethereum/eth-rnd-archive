        "content": "\u003c@!203220829473996800\u003e I think the easiest way to do the TODO about deposits for the tutorial, in a client independent way is to simply add a note at the beginning, before running your `eth2-val-tools keystores`  to simply generate more keys than the validator count at genesis in case you are planning to add deposits. This way they are already included in the clients, I can just grab those keys and generate the deposit data and submit the transactions on the fly. Will add that script. This saves us from writing another client dependent section. Would this be acceptable?",

The EF and core teams have mostly a well distributed set of client combinations. We risk getting more weight on a client if the number of keys run by regular users is comparable to teams. In my own local network here I am seeing prysm stuck voting for the hash at slot 0 on all proposals, even after deposits are included and activated. So if we concentrate for example on prysm I'd expect  that we won' t onboard new validators.",
