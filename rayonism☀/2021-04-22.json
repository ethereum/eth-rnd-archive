We will share enough keys so everyone can test block-proposals, but not to break finality when going offline or when repeatedly restarting during testing. I do not expect all participants will be online all the time, but coordinating around genesis would be nice. Monday for genesis is probably too early, Tuesday can work (assuming participants can start a node or two on Monday, and connect to the main deployment/bootnodes).",
