Discord mods and stage-mods can put people on-stage (allow listener to unmute). This is an experiment, we'll use normal voice channels if it doesn't work.\nAround the start of the hackathon, maybe Mon 19 we could do another big Zoom call if deemed necessary.\nFor now we focus on quick iteration towards the first devnet.",
