We're hoping to add Nethermind soon (thanks to work of \u003c@!628018527470616606\u003e ) and then also Prysm/Lighthouse when ready.",

Teku and Catalyst in-sync with latest spec. Misc client updates that join the call (Nethermind progress, Prysm progress, who else is joining the call?)\n- Running local devnets, setting tentative genesis date for devnet0 (start next week? Maybe a 1-day testnet end of this week?)\n- Questions/discussion",

Updates later\n- Sharding will build on merge prototype, later in hackathon, not yet. Will open separate group to focus on sharding specifically. Specs are mostly ready though\n- Adding SSZ type tests for merge soon\n- Goal is 1-day long shared devnet on Friday\n- Shared devnet target early next week, depending on results for Friday. Still planned to be short-lived (~week)\n- Proto might implement temporary sync tool to pull blocks from beacon node, and push to eth1 node. Clients can and should focus on long-term sync strategy",
