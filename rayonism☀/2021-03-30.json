        "content": "The merge-sharding hackathon project has a name now: Rayonism ☀️   https://rayonism.io/\n\nThe idea is to build a Merge testnet, and then extend with Sharding during the EthGlobal Scaling hackathon (mid April - mid May). This is all super experimental, but a great way for everyone to get involved with the merge work, and push those scaling limits.\n\nIn the next two weeks we'll continue to develop the \"meta-specs\": a place for everything around current merge/sharding specs, implementation work, and hackathon specifics. Around the hackathon start we aim to stabilize this, and move it into a GitHub repo for more open iteration on it.\nYou can find more planning on the site and in the meta-specs. We'll try to organize some early-bird call next week or so for those who don't like to wait. Get involved!",
