After this we'll continue with sharding and withdrawals prototyping, but move to productionize the Merge spec (transition + new API format, isolated from user JSON-RPC) and work on Altair/London.\n- Devnet genesis is tomorrow, noon UTC\n- Testnet configs: https://github.com/protolambda/nocturne\n- Tutorial to run nodes: https://github.com/protolambda/mergenet-tutorial/\n- Fork monitor: https://fork.nocturne.rayonism.io/\n- Block explorer: https://nocturne.rayonism.io/   (experimental)\n- Ansible for 12 combi setup + explorer + forkmon + etc., for the curious: https://github.com/protolambda/mergenet-ansible/\n- Devnet plan:\n  - Zoom call ~ 30 min before genesis, no obligations, just fun\n  - Check fork monitor and explorer, wait for finality  (if everything goes well, this is super experimental after all...)\n  - After at least 30 min of finality, we will try deposits and more advanced transactions\n  - \u003c@!755590043632140352\u003e has fun plans to break the devnet. Everyone is welcome to also try, that's what it is for. Just share your plans here before you execute them, so we can debug and improve on whatever is the effect.\n  - Eth1 voting will be interesting (vote for its own chain, with 8 hour delay). We expect some issues, but with no bad majority, everything should be fine, and then deposits can be processed.\n  - During the devnet, we are testing some modifications to Eth1 clients (e.g. forkchoicer PR in Geth), but no major changes compared to Steklo",

        "content": "\u003c@!203220829473996800\u003e Thanks for merging the PRs in the mergenet-tutorial. In from_docker.md under Prysm, there are two pairs docker images listed, on with merge-mainnet at the end, and one with merge-minimal. The minimal docker image fails to start with the genesis.ssz for nocturne:\n```\ntime=\"2021-05-11 20:36:00\" level=error msg=\"could not load genesis from file: too big for the list\" prefix=main\n```\nThe merge-mainnet image works and my Pyrsm node waits for genesis. Do you know what's the -minimal image for? (Or maybe someone from Pyrsm could answer that). Should we have the -minimal image in the tutorial if it doesn't work with nocturne?",
