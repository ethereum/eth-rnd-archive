Currently I think we should organize some early-bird call where we can coordinate with others to make the most out of the early resources/time we have until the hackathon. And then start something more similar to office-hours, like a call at a set time every other day that's optional, and at least me and maybe a few others others will be able to discuss the latest things?",

I want to avoid conflicts with other calls/obligations for everyone as much as possible. Also, I think we may want to change to a different time of day than eth 'o clock, since we've a lot of interested folks in PT timezone, or close to that. I'll post some suggestions below, add a discord emoji and we'll see what works best.",
