What I am doing is very straightforward: grab slot, delay, graffiti for the block in slot N and the votes for the block in slot N+1, declare correct those that had the same root as the block my node thought is target in slot 0 and  declare correct votes on head those votes on the root of slot N. So I am assuming that a) My node is on the canonical chain and b) all blocks I am getting are on the canonical chain. This is a strong asumption but it's fine in the long term since I only care about aggregates. So I am seeing obvious correlations that slot came late, head vote was bad. But also I seeing some other weird stuff",
