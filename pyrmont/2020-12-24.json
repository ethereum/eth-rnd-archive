        "content": "Much of team effort has been in improving block production. I wander if there has been an attempt to delay attestations in slot zero. Reports of users losing Gwei on slot zero started picking up on Discord channels. A good head+target vote outweighs the inclusion distance reward. What I would want to try is to delay waiting for the first block a few more seconds before submitting an attestation. These will most likely be included later, at the risk of not being included at all. But I would want to see a simulation of the economics of this setup. It should be simple to implement and test on pyrmont. Unfortunately to measure any impact I'd have to have many validators so the only ones that can effectively do this are the dev teams+EF. Is it a terribly bad idea?",
