Tradition is for testnets to use a palindrome, which would suggest epoch 61616 is a good option (slot 1971712 which is 2021-08-19 08:22:31 UTC) Conveniently not midnight for me. 🙂\nPalindrome epoch numbers don't happen very often though so we may not want to keep that tradition.\n\nIf we just went for reasonably round numbers, I'd suggest epoch 61700 (slot 1974400 at 2021-08-19 20:39:55 UTC) which is the timeslot we use internally for AU-EU-US meetings because it works out as kind of ok for everyone.",
