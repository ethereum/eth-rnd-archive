Looking at ways to restart them, and resolve validator performance issues with latest experimental (!) changes (we run a good amount, stressing the old prysm slashing protection db code). This amounts to about 4 - 5% of pyrmont validators.\n- I have not updated EF Teku yet, but it's running very stable (at a little higher memory though). Will update for the latest improvements after resolving prysm update.",

They're performing exactly as well as all our other nodes which is nice.  Will be doing an update to all nodes at some point today.",
