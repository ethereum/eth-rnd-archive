This is going to be very slow, cause I have only two validators running, but since yesterday I got 13 attestations scheduled on slot zero, 9 of which the block came before the 4 seconds mark, 1 I was an aggregator anyway,  but three of them, the block didn't come until  the 4 seconds mark (in all cases it was missing). The attestations were submitted at 6.4780 second and 6.6465 and 6.4843 seconds respectively. They got included with inclusion distance of 1, 4 and 1. All cases the inclusion distance was minimal  (all blocks between attestation and inclusion were missing). So this means that I didn't gain anything by waiting 6 seconds since anyway would have voted for previous head. But also didn't lose anything which was a fear.",
