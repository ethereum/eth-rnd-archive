Lighthouse team (~17% of network stake) nodes appear to be all offline ( \u003c@!361447803194441738\u003e \u003c@!602753420033785856\u003e ) . We are looking into it, but the sigp team may not be awake to get them back online right now. Meanwhile also 5/20 EF nodes (4% of network stake, 2x lighthouse, 3x nimbus) are offline, I'll try to get them back on.",
