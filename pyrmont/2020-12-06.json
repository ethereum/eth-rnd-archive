See graphs in https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/3326\nTeku has two open PRs for epoch optimizations (not running it when not necessary, and catch up with optimizations of other clients). I've merged them with latest branch and built a docker image `protolambda/teku:fasterteku`, and about to try them out on Pyrmont.",
