I think \u003c@!399309815517544451\u003e discovered some issues with a db migration gone wrong around that time so could be an artefact of that, but we've had issues with invalid signatures a fair while back because of validator duties not handling late blocks properly so thought I'd mention it in case its a sign of something bigger.",
