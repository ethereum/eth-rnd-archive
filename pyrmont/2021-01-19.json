This was meant to be a stress test and mainnet is headed for that order of magnitude of the number of validators. RAM consumption is starting to bite users on the lower end. I think it would be a realistic test of client resource consumption if we let pyrmont not finalize and throw in a couple of random delays to have forks. Modulo de problem that network topology is concentrated, I still would expect an explosion in RAM consumption.",
