I am not sure  if 0x0a is  compatible with proving multiple elements. You mentioned hackmd (https://hackmd.io/@dapplion/blob_sharing#Appendix-KZG-commitment-proofs-for-data-subset) said that using pairing check to prove a subset belong to a commitment, the pairing check (bls12381.PairingCheck ?) is still in the next upgrade plan and has not been activated on the mainnet.",

I checked the EIP and it says the cost of a pairing is `43_000*k + 65_000` This is out of sync with 0x0a so I imagine that that will get updated",
