Right up until the end, if Ethereum is the most profitable use of their assets then I suspect the vast majority will continue to mine Ethereum.  We may see a reduction in investment, and as hardware dies it won't be replaced, but those things don't introduce 51% attack opportunities.\n\u003c@!301186049323958275\u003e It's also worth saying that we will probably use the beacon chain as a \"checkpoint\" mechanism long before the actual switch, so that will put a maximum length on any attacks.",
