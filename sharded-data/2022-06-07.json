        "content": "EIP-4844 update:\nAfter some review of applications and discussion with authors it looked like no L2 actually plans to use the blob-verification precompile. The other precompile, aka point-evaluation precompile, to proof a single value is part of a blob, is sufficient for the ZK rollup construction proposed in the EIP/docs so far, as well as optimistic rollups with an interactive fraud-proof (like arbitrum and optimism). So we decided to drop it from the EIP to simplify things. If we really need it, we can still add it in a later upgrade without changing anything about the current EIP implementation.\n\nPR to EIP: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5140\nUpdate to geth prototype: https://github.com/protolambda/go-ethereum/pull/1/commits/b58bd6ede515d2f7628cda58d2b6bf71e07659ac",
