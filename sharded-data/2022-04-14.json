Is there any likelihood that, on minimal beacon node hardware, the process of doing so would ever become a bottleneck?\n\nIf such a problem might occur, would it be worthwhile to start looking into how beacon node operators might need to plan for that, such as with hardware acceleration through attached FPGAs?",
