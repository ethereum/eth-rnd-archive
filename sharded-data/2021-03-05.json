        "content": "Thank you for this great explanation!\n\na. How (1) works is clear, although it's weird to me that we take only a single bit. Increasing the number of bits reduces the probability of guessing the bit exponentially, so it would seem that using e.g. 8 bits is better. 7 more bits of data is next to nothing and you reduce the guess to a mere 1/(2^8). Given that Dankrad proposed a better solution, which I have glanced over and saw that the bit is no longer required, this question might be not relevant anymore. \n\nb. Just to confirm - in (2) you have to present the actual data, not some hash/bit/whatever? If so, then I guess it's a way out in a scenario where there are issues with getting the data from DAS.",

        "content": "(a) yes, more bits would actually be \"better\" wrt catching the offender earlier. Because we use signature aggregation only of *like* messages, having a single bit induces two messages types for the same attestation (the message that is the primary vehicle for info from the validator). Attestations are produced once per epoch by each validator (once per 6.4 minutes) so the idea with a single bit is that in expecation, if the validation is shirking this duty, they will guess the bit incorrectly very quickly. Yes, if they just do this every once in a while, they might get away with it, but even then, it's a coin flip!\n\nnote, the bit scheme (although similar to the 1 custody bit) is actually going to use something like this in production -- https://ethresear.ch/t/a-0-001-bit-proof-of-custody/7409\nThis makes it so your chances of getting 1 (True) is 100 or 1000x more likely than getting a 0 (False). In the event that you get a 0, you just don't broadcast a message at all! This ensures that all *like* attestations from a committee are aggregatable and greatly reduces consensus complexity in dealing with two message types. If you sign a message when the bit says False, then you get slashed (similiar to the previous scheme when signing a message with the incorrect bit). In expectation, this doesn't happen to often, but in expectation if you are shirking this duty frequently, you'll lose all your money at some point. Note, the \"downside\" here is that 1% or 0.1% (however you tune it) of attestations just will not broadcast included on chain. This reduces participation marginally but this is tiny wrt to the whole validator set and so can be swept under the rug",
