Blobs represent a constant load on the network (not linearly growing) so I don't think we should really care what is in them, spam or not. That constant value should be tuned to be fine for the network, regardless \n\nAs for L2s being incentivized to swap early on (unrealistic expectations), I see that as a good thing. This is where scalable data will be in Ethereum. And by 1 to 1.5 years hopefully we have some at least moderate upticks in data gas limit\n\nAdditionally, with an independent blob market, dominantly used by L2s, I suspect additional L2 activity (maybe you could call much of it \"spam\") to fill the supply quickly",
