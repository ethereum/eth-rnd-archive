On lighthouse, this would involve adding another preset configuration that we won't use anywhere else so it'd be a pain to maintain only for the devnets.\nAny particular reason why we can't use mainnet/minimal presets? afaik, we have used mainnet presets for all merge and altair devnets",

Another reason for not using minimal was `FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB` (4) conflicts with whats been used in execution (4096)\nso we could probably stick with mainnet preset, unless we really need the lower `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` ?",
