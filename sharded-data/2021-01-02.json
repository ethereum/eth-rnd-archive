        "content": "Hi, the new sharding design for DAS looks cool.\nRegarding the new spec, are my understandings below correct?\n- There is no notion of shard chain or shard block anymore. We only have blobs of data. (Essentially, we don't divide the blockchain itself, but the data availability work.)\n- In the previous design, the shard chain's data is ordered even before crosslinked in the beacon chain. OTOH, in the new design, the order of the blobs in each shard is only decided when they are included in the beacon chain. There is no need for \"ShardTransition\" containers.\n- There is only one gas-price globally. In the previous design, we had a fee market on each shard to incentivize users to move to a shard with a low fee so that we can use the full capacity of the system.\n- For the Eth2 light client contract in Eth1 used for rollups, Eth1 need BLS12-381 (i.e., EIP-2537).",
