In order to confirm that, I would like to ask a few questions based on the original proposal https://ethresear.ch/t/1-bit-aggregation-friendly-custody-bonds/2236:\n\n1. Assume validator V commits data D and doesn't keep it. Because of this V won't be able to respond to a challenge, right?\n2. Does a validator need to keep data for anything else than the blocks that it proposed?\n3. What happens when D becomes unavailable for some reason (from the point of DAS) after the custody secret `s` has been revealed? If V is able to respond to challenges, should it republish D? Do challenges themselves make D available again? What if D becomes unavailable *before* `s` is revealed?",
