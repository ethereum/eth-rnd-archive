Basically, if we make the equivalence of tx blob hashes in the EL payload and blob hashes from the CL blobs an ephemeral check during normal EL/CL communication, there is no way to repeat that check during EL full sync (where it syncs directly from EL p2p). So a malicious validator majority could now trick a new user into ending up on an invalid chain, even if doing both CL and EL full sync from a valid weak subjectivity checkpoint. I think this is why we originally rejected that approach a year ago. If we really prefer this approach, the blob hash list should be committed to in the EL block header (where it can be parsed by both CL and EL, and is persisted and checked during EL-only sync)",
