Seems like `FIAT_SHAMIR_PROTOCOL_DOMAIN`  is more a constant than a preset.\nJust for additional clarification: everything under `polynomial-commitments.md` falls under the responsibility of the kzg library (ie validation that BLSFieldElements  must be in `0 \u003c= x \u003c BLS_MODULUS` ), is that correct?",
