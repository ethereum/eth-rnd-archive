CC: \u003c@881905303011086387\u003e to confirm.",

        "content": "Yes, EIP-6475 will be updated to take account of \u003c@555483069038198827\u003e 's feedback that the `Some` case should have a leading `0x01` byte. `None` will remain as empty, and union will be updated to also encode the `None` case as empty instead of `0x00`.\n\nBesides that, EIP-6475 and EIP-6493 should be reviewed by relevant parties and will be discussed during EIP-4844 call on Monday 1 May 2023 (I probably won't make it myself). Reviews through ethmagicians and other channels are also welcome.\n\nEIP-4844 would then be updated to use EIP-6475 (for the optional `to` field, and API return values) and EIP-6493 (with the 6493 txid going into the `transactions` MPT instead of the keccak going in there)",
