(the tx can have 0 blobs). Which offers fixed size tx fields/offsets, and merkleized contents. Can’t find rationale info in spec or website however. We should add that if we go for this change. And maybe I’m missing something. (re @inphi: What was the reason for changing the base intrinsic gas from 21000 to 20000?)",
