I read through this and a few things are not that clear to me. https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/ Let's assume we are talking about the \"State execution not needed\" case for simplicity. 1) what's the sharding \"key\"? do we automatically shard transactions by transaction_hash? from address? to address? or entirely manual? 2) can a transaction be executed cross multiple shards? \n\nJust by reading the document it feels to me like manual: let's say agree arbitrum on shard 1, optimism on shard 2, dydx on shard 3.. and cross shards are not supported. is that right?",
