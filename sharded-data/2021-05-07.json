If proposers are responsible for that then they may cheat and disseminate only a `blob` while attesters have an incentive to disseminate a header of a blob they are attesting to. Since `blob_header` dissemination is a one-step process wrt `attestation` (which is two-step) the former should go smoother in most of the cases.",
