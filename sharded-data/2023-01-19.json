If yes, will those priority fees get transferred to the execution layer to be paid out?\n\nIn the EIP I see \"max_priority_fee_per_gas\" within \"BlobTransaction\", but couldnt find additional info: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#new-transaction-type\n\nAsking because there's a question about this on Reddit!",
