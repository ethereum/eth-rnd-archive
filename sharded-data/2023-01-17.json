I think it's elastic, as the use cases that are enabled will pay less per transaction, but much more in total fees (re @sharded_data_bot: \u003cwreynoir\u003e Random question: Is there a good explanation as to how ETH can still be deflationary after scalability upgrades like protodanksharding? Wouldn't those upgrades reduce gas fees, and thus reduce the amount of ETH being burnt?)",
