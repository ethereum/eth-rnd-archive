This is tackled in https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3093 which IMHO impacts some useful invariants in the crypto code (i.e. the invariant that when we are asked to validate a blob, we are also given a blob to validate).\n\nHas it been considered that the `blobs_sidecar` could be optional? And if yes, why has it been discarded as a notion?\n\nThanks!",
