On-chain DA will be a fraction of current price, this is great for rollups.  The reason I don't think we are hearing lots of noise from zk teams is because many of them use off-chain DA solutions like DA committees.  I'm planning to build out a L2 rollup platform that uses blob data in the not too distant future 🤞",
