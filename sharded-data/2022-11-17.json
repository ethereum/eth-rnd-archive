We are cutting a release tomorrow so we can either\n1. do nothing (these conditions are fine for non-adversarial testnets as is)\n2. do the fixes from the issue\n3. remove root and slot from sidecar\n\nWill default to (1) unless there is a particular reason to rush in (2) or (3) before the release",
