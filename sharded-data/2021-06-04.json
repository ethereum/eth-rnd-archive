        "content": "Hello, I want to get in-depth acquainted with the theory behind data-availability and the sharding branch of the repo. But I am facing a little problem which is lack of language. Many of the introductory posts are written towards devs or coders and are very basic in their mathematical content but filled with jargon that I assume is basic for the CS oriented person.  As an example, the post by Vitalik:\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2017/01/14/exploring_ecp.html\nSketches on very basic algebraic geometry, but has sentences like `And going up to quadratic is enough to let us work with deterministic threshold signatures` that require me to look everywhere to understand.  I would **highly** appreciate some help finding some technical documents for me to start reading. I already read in some detail `Kate, Zaverucha and Goldbert`,  but besides that and Vitalik's post above, I only read the documents linked in the repo, that is Dankrad's https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html and https://hackmd.io/G-Iy5jqyT7CXWEz8Ssos8g \nWhat would you indicate to someone that knows nothing of cryptography besides the basics of RSA and ECC?",

My problem is that I am not even a first year undergrad in CS so I feel that what I am requiring is perhaps an introduction to proofs, just to get used to the language. I think I'll grab something basic on Merkle trees and see what's the language that's being used there.",
