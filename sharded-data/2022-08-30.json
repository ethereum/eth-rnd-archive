Im mostly afk today, but i can get more precise profiles later.\n\nbtw, batching the modular inverse operations in the barycentric formula loop is quite effective. We're seeing a 3x improvement in blob verification. For transaction batches under 8, this is as fast as verifying aggregated blobs (without kzg proofs). While performance still falls behind as the mempool gets bigger, I'm pretty happy with this performance.",
