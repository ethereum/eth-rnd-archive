I guess you are saying you could publish the non-committed blobs later. If this is the main worry, then a simple rule of not propagating (and discarding) any non-committed blobs *once a block has been received* would eliminate that.\n\n\nThis extra orphaning risk might be quite small, but I also think that any bandwidth/storage/DOS vector from this is quite small. For example, we already have a much larger vector than this through transaction gossip: You can send transactions and then cancel them (either through the mempool, or by sending them as part of a block without going through the cost. The latter is zero cost if you do it with a transaction you wanted to send anyway). Theoretically you could use these to share files etc., but I don't think it has any real advantage to just doing it through an existing file sharing network that is much more optimized for actually providing the data afterwards and also supports much larger files without the limit of having to be a proposer?",
