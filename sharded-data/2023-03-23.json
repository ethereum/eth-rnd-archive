L2s really are their own chains, and need to have their own persistent history layer. L1 data availability is very limited in scope to protect against malicious withholding attacks by sequencers. The data is only made available long enough that honest participants are ensured to have been able to recover and re-seed it to the L2 persistence layer if it was withheld there in the first place.",
