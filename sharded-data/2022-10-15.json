This new API will be pleasant for client devs because more tasks are shoved into the crypto lib, and hence there is less stuff to do on the actual client impl.\n\nWhile I predict that this new API is quite final (there is not much that can be done to improve it), there are some review comments by Dankrad that should be resolved.\n\nI won't be around much the next two weeks, so if it's not resolved in the meanwhile, I will fix the PR up when I come back.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3038",
