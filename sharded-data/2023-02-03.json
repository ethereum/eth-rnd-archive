Probably not a concern and I could be wrong but thought it's worth bringing up",

        "content": "Thanks \u003c@425572898787426305\u003e  - if I'm not mistaken we’re talking about similar things (I think*). The earlier proposal (https://hackmd.io/a8eyJ505Q62gXMbYr0v7_w?view#Block-Proposal---Builder-flow)  was to have the relayer return the blobs as part of the `submitBlindedBlock` response (revealed payload + blobs), so that beacon node can broadcast the signed block and blobs (also done by relayer). but now if blobs need to be signed then validator will need the blobs in advance via the new `getBlindBlockAndBlobs` method like you suggested. I guess we could consider having validator sign off the blobs in advance regardless of whether blocks and blobs are decoupled, so there's less additional changes on the relayer / builder side if the decision is to decouple the blobs later? do you see any downside to this? Is there any concerns with revealing the blobs in advance?",
