For example, what happens if a validator is online, goes offline for a while (1 year let's say), then comes back online. Does it still commit transactions to the same shard as before?",

        "content": "What article/post are you basing your questions on? My understanding of how shard might work in Ethereum is that _users_ choose what shard to publish transactions to. Validators are assigned to random committees, and the shard that a validator has to attest to changes over time. That \"shuffling/randomizing over time\" part is implied by a statements like _\"They may get lucky once in a while by random chance, but only if they control a very large fraction (\u003e 1/3) of all validators.\"_ , so not entirely sure about that.\n\nCheck out https://github.com/tvanepps/EthereumDiscordGuidebook/blob/main/README.md#sharded-data for an overview of sharding docs if you haven't yet",
