Each block may contain some number of blob-type transactions (max 6).\n3. Each blob transaction may contain multiple blob hashes (min 1, max 6). \n4. The EVM may access blob hashes by using the index of the blob within that same transaction. \n5. Blobs from other transactions are not accessible by the EVM.\n6. No blob hashes from prior blocks are accessible by the EVM.",
