It could also be configured in spec tests via `with_config_overrides` decorator. (re @dannyryan: in terms of spec, I'd rather avoid import random from python and instead use some sort of stub SAFE_RANDOMNESS_FUNCTION() that has an english definition and in testing we instantiate with the python random library)",
