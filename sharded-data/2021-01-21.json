I remember a year ago, the eth2 roadmap had a concept of multiple execution environments, which would abstract the execution semantics of any conceivable programmable blockchain.\n\nIt kind of looks like (in this rollup-centric roadmap) that rollups take the place of execution environments, so to the experience is basically the same to the end user?",
