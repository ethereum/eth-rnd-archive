I argued that any change that alters the consensus rules in a non-backwards-compatible manner (eg bump in BPO values) is a defacto hardfork (regardless if it was deployed via new code or in a parametric way, like BPOs). Therefore, it’s safer to treat it as such and represent it correctly wherever the protocol tracks the current fork version. Otherwise we could end up with inconsistencies that cause problems down the line. Unfortunately, the consensus was to seek the minimal viable solution. So I complied and kept the network level segregation via ForkDigest. Anyway, I’ll study this tomorrow and circle back. Thanks for raising!",
