Since you have fully implemented the KZG verification feature, can you please give me a list of KZG/polynomial functions that you would expect blst to expose so that you can fully replace go-kzg?\n\nI have already passed an initial list to the supranational people, but I want to make sure that I'm not missing any functions.\n\nAs a side question, I'm curious at where you would draw the line of blst. For example, looking at validate_blobs_sidecar() (https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/eip4844/validator.md#validate_blobs_sidecar) do we want blst to provide us with `evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form()` and `verify_kzg_proof()` and have the client devs piece everything together, or would we prefer that blst implements the entire function in its entirety? Same goes for `compute_proof_from_blobs()` and `validate_blobs_and_kzg_commitments()`.\n\nThanks!",
