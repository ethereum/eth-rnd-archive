        "content": "Hey! Trying to understand `degree_commitment`. \nDidn't find anything besides validation in the spec \n```\n    assert (\n        bls.Pairing(body_summary.degree_proof, G2_SETUP[0])\n        == bls.Pairing(body_summary.commitment.point, G2_SETUP[-body_summary.commitment.length])\n    )\n```\nIs my logic correct: \n1. If the data has `k` points then the polynomial `p(x)` would be of degree `\u003c k`\n2. Max polynomial degree is `N`\n3. To prove the `p(x)` degree `\u003ck` we are committing to polynomial `q(x) = p(x) * x^(N - k)` (`q(x)` degree would be `\u003cN`)\n4. If `p(x)` degree is `\u003e=k` then the above commitment is impossible as  the resulting `q(x)` would have degree `\u003eN` (above max degree)\n\n\u003c@!555483069038198827\u003e have I correctly reverse engineered the logic?",
