If on type is pooled, the other is rejected until the pool empties. I.e. you cannot replace a blob tx with a non-blob one.\n- Included blob txs are kept in limbo until finality to support resurrecting back into the pool on reorgs",

I can gladly discuss any potential issues with them, but these are design choices to support the high capacity of the pool and to avoid hitting the same issues that have been plaguiging the main txpool. Happy to be made aware of flaws in my logic and course correct of course, but I don't want to lightly reconsider base assumptions.",
