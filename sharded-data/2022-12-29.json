        "content": "Question about the 4844 spec regarding Hash value for blob transactions. For signing purposes, the spec specifies computing the hash as  keccak256(BLOB_TX_TYPE + sz.hash_tree_root(tx.**message**)), which makes sense since it excludes the signature values.\n\nNow, I had assumed then that when computing the *signed* blob tx's hash, we might use instead keccak256(BLOB_TX_TYPE + ssz.hash_tree_root(tx)) to include the signature material. But, I guess from EIP-2718 it should perhaps be keccak256(BLOB_TX_TYPE + ssz.**serialize**(tx))  which is not quite the same.\n\nAssuming the latter (EIP-2718) implementation is the correct way to go, I have a PR to clarify the spec here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6238",

        "content": "Second question (which I almost hate to suggest, but....):  for consistency sake, would it make sense to change the 4844 spec to use keccak256(BLOB_TX_TYPE + sz.**serialize**(tx.message)) for the tx_hash for signing? Doesn't seem there's a need to use a hash-tree root for this purpose.  cc: \u003c@203220829473996800\u003e\n\n[Edit:] There is some discussion on this in the PR here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6241",
