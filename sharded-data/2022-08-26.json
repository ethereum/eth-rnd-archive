The reason I ask is because it's trying to import some files from the main build instead of the fork, e.g. \"import of \"github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain/core/blob\"\" and \"import of \"github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain/core/blocks\".\nIf we can't use Bazel, is someone able to share the method to get go to compile everything, without having to compile each subfolder individually? I'm not familiar with go",
