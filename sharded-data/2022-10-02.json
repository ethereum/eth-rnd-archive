Rather than each beacon node hold its own copy of the data, would there be any appetite in having an option to use an external data store accessed through a simple API?  This would allow for sharing the storage between trusted nodes, or even handing it off to external services (which I know isn't ideal, but adding another 500GB to storage requirements could result in further loss of solo stakers).",

So that number can be halfed\n\nAdditionally, I'm not convinced 1/2 is realistic with current networking so we either need more networking complexity or lower tuned value (value could be lower until more advanced networking in subsequent upgrade)\nSo maybe another 50% there\n\nAnd agreed on month being the upper bound of what has been considered. 2 weeks seems sufficient for any use case we are aware of. And some argue even shorter",
