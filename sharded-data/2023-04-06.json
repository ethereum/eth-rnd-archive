        "content": "My understanding of KZG is that we have a polynomial *P* and the prover says \"I evaluated *P(x)* and it equals *y*. Here is the commitment *C*, which proves that I used the polynomial *P* for evaluation and the proof *π* which proves that the evaluation at *x* equals *y*. Combining these things together the verifier can make sure that *P(x) = y* without evaluating the polynomial themselves. Now how does it relate to blobs? Does each blob represent a separate polynomial or a single point on the polynomial generated from trusted setup? Or multiple points on the polynomial from trusted setup? And if I verify all the proofs correctly, then what does it tell me? That the blobs are somehow \"valid\"? This last thing is especially fuzzy for me.",
