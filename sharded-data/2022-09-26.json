Specifically on how you plan to send transactions since the new format is only available in the forks of Geth and Prysm for the devnet.\nMaybe you could implement the spammer as a wrapper of \u003c@159152274659082240\u003e blob-utils tool (in Go).\n\u003c@456226577798135808\u003e I created an issue in `ethers-rs` for the support of EIP-4844 transaction format, I saw you posted a comment in another issue about that.

I tried doing a variant of that for raw eth transactions with https://github.com/gakonst/eth-vegeta/ + https://github.com/gakonst/spammers. So we'd generate a bunch of json rpc requests and then submit them en masse with vegeta, which is a well optimized load testing tool.",
