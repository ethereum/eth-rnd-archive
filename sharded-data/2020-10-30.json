        "content": "\u003e Hi, given the current plan to completely move to PoS at Phase 1.5, what incentives would miners have to support the ETH1 PoW chain till the very last minute(time at which ETH1 is hotswapped as a shard in to ETH2). If miners decide to shut down their operations what actions could be taken to prevent 51% attacks etc? I guess this question might be addressed later on, but was curious to know if you guys had any strategy in mind for this scenario\n\u003c@487281155679191041\u003e I'm not terribly worried about miners forgoing money out of spite.  Right up until the end, if Ethereum is the most profitable use of their assets then I suspect the vast majority will continue to mine Ethereum.  We may see a reduction in investment, and as hardware dies it won't be replaced, but those things don't introduce 51% attack opportunities.",
