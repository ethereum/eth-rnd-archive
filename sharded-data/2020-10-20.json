        "content": "Hi. My team is researching the economics/users' behavior of Eth2 in a project called Shargri-La. \nhttps://ethresear.ch/t/shargri-la-a-transaction-level-sharded-blockchain-simulator/7936\nMotivated by the Rollup-centric roadmap, we are now looking at the economics of Phase 1.\n\nSince there is no \"transaction\" in the Phase 1 spec, I'm curious about whether only block proposers are assumed to put data on shards, or there is some off-chain mechanism for users to request validators to put their data on shards. For example, users and Eth2 validators can use Eth1 to make a contract like \"if a validator *V* puts the data whose hash is *h* on Eth2 within *N* slots, *V* can receive *X* ETH.\" Without such a mechanism, Rollup operators must be Eth2 validators.\nhttps://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698/43\n\nI found a related issue that mentions the out-of-band fee mechanism, but it seems discussing about Phase 2.\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1280",

        "content": "Yes, there must be a fee market for shard data. Likely this would need to be resolved in the eth1 shard (before a merge, eth1 can learn about eth2 via a contract based light client)\n\nI wrote a simple contract based fee market proposal the other day\n\nhttps://notes.ethereum.org/-_I3i4uNRTeGRUc73zVTTQ\n\nThis requires a relatively high load of on chain txs so thats not desirable on L1",
