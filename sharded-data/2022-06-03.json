        "content": "Hi there, I have a pretty simple question. If we want to reconstruct sharded data, which is encoded as `m` shard blobs in `m` KZG commitments, then we need `m*k` samples in the naive solution. So far, so good. In the 2D KZG scheme, if a validator observes rows, then it still needs `m*k` samples for reconstruction. Where is the benefit here? What can be done with the 2D scheme that is not possible with the 1D scheme?",

        "content": "It's not the same number of samples. The 2D scheme requires more samples per blob, more than twice since in the 1D scheme an attacker needs to make 50% of the blob unavailable while in the 2D scheme it needs only 25%, so validators need to check that 75% is available. However, the difference is that in the 1D scheme you need to do this on every shard, giving you an extra factor of 64 (assuming 64 shards) while in the 2D scheme the full block is sent at once",
