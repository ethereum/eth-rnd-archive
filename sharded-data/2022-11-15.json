If that is of the same computational complexity as doing the kzg verification, then signing def doesn't make sense\n\nAs for increasing the number from 256kb to something larger, we need to consider not only the bandwidth but the additional computation cost at each hop — which CALLDATA won't 100% mirror although block data is merklized so some extra comp cost happens in this case) (re @inphi: ah right, thanks. We'll be signing the merkle root of the sidecar. At the community call we discussed this and are favoring kzg proof verification. If it becomes an issue in the future/postupgrade, we can always switch to signature verification.\nWe'll discuss this again at the next community call so feedback is still welcome.)",
