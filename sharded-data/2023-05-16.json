        "content": "continuting big endian discussion from yesterdays call:\nit was mentioned that custody game requires the CL to interpret blob data as field element and not just a chunk of data.\nThe only thing i can see as per my current understanding of the custody game (courtesy https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/568)  is computing `C[i] = mix(rk[p], D[i])`, but `mix` function could be as simple as `sha` not requiring `D[i]` to be a field element.\n\nso in essense for CL blob is just data, erasure coding can be supplied by underlying crypto lib. Let me know if my understanding is correct (disclaimer: I concede that  i have just started to look into it so can this could be a naive question or my understanding very primitive)",
