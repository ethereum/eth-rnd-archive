I think if you want to make this general from the start (which is now possible and much harder to do later) then I think we should split EIPs and not just group on \"hardfork name\". \n\nBecause, if we first have hardfork with config C and now want to do exactly the same hardfork, but with EIP X in it, then the config will thus not change and therefore also not the hash (not nice)",

        "content": "I agree it feels a bit \"too much\" because then the config forkID EIP is essentially also part of the next fork spec. NVM: this is not true, either use the old forkID (then timestamp is correct) or the config. This is not ideal though and we should not do it because it divides the peers which are (they should be) correct in two pools which don't communicate with each other since they are seen as to be on another network\nI'm actually thinking if we would use this configuration + forkID together it means you either connect to the correct nodes if you have the correct hash or the incorrect nodes if you have the (same) incorrect hash. Not sure if this is good or bad. If you can't connect at all to any peer then you can be rather sure you have the wrong config 🤔",
