        "content": "I would like to bring up the idea that we implement escalator for gas prices before EIP 1559, regardless of the future of EIP 1559 or EIP 1559 + escalating tips, for the simple reason that we need transaction 'deadlines' and escalating gas prices _yesterday_ to handle the UX problems of today. Today's UX consists of constantly resubmitting and cancelling transactions because you never know when your transaction will be dropped from the mempool or included, and it's completely non-deterministic which TX wins. The escalator gas price algorithm is very simple, easily understood, and I think universally agreed upon, and significantly improves the current wallet UX.\n\nI remember it today because I just got into a situation where I had several old TXs queued up in MetaMask because I had set a very low gas price for an old TX, and cancelling an old one doesn't do anything about the newer ones I sent after it, so I have to send additional transactions just to cancel the old ones with higher nonce than the bad one. The UX for setting gas prices very urgently needs help. If my TX didn't get in 3 days ago I probably want to resubmit with a higher gas price or cancel it, but there's nothing the wallet can do about it without my approval.",
