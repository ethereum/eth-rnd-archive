        "content": "Re: 1559 what exactly is hoped to be gained by simulations?  The problem is that we don't know how humans will behave, not that we don't know what will happen given certain human behaviors.  1559 is pretty simple in terms of the mechanism design IMO and it can be modeled pretty easily once you have assumptions about human behavior.  Creating a simulation won't give you any better of an idea of how humans behave though.",
