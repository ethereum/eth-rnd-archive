If miners abuse it, we can simply run a soft fork which doesn't accept blocks with gas limit \u003e X, and then add such an EIP in the next HF.",

Relying on a soft-fork could take days / weeks, in which we could have many blocks that are much larger size than we find acceptable. Seems to me there is little upside to leaving this up to block producers.",
