        "content": "\u003e I am not a fan of the escalator outside the protocol personally. For the HD wallets implications and mainly regarding scalability. The network overhead impact would be too high IMO.\nAnother thing related to this: eth/65 was just introduced as a networking protocol to reduce the bandwidth used by gossiping full transactions on the network. IIRC, it was ~75% of the bandwidth usage for Geth nodes (I assume post sync?). If \"escalator outside the protocol\" becomes the norm, I think it's safe to assume this will consume a majority of the gossiping bandwidth on the network. That makes me slightly against it, but I think I would need to understand better how often it would happen (i.e. if it's only needed in the \"5% of time\" as per Derbit's analysis, how much bandwidth is that? OTOH, if it's only needed 5% of the time, how likely is it to actually get implemented by most wallets?)",
