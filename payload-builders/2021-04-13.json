Vis-a-vis, miner pricing changes but no changes to Tx Format and no changes to wallets. But we completely understand that 1559 could be in implementation phase so rolling-back that will be costly. Also, some parts have not been analysed in-length enough (the weighted median possibly, there are some simulations with main-net data but without base fees ). Although the additive changes in baseFee, I saw that is has a lot of positive feedback in the forum, and possibly has more chances to get into \"1559 v2\". My main concern is what is the cost of upgrading all wallets, gas station estimators and light-clients is easy to estimate and might take weeks or months to complete that in July.",
