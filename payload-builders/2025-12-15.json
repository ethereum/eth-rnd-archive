Titan suggested that the CL client should not accept bids from P2P after they \"sent\" the request for bids on trusted builders. I'm strongly against this. Honest behavior should be request at 0 with a deadline. Evaluate at that deadline everything you got.  Clients that want to play timing games, acting rationally, will try to make that deadline larger, but still are inclined to evaluate and continue listening on the p2p layer until the very last moment as well",
