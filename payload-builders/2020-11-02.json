        "content": "I think there is a large schism in social circles between devs and miners and a lot of the discussion on both sides occurs in echo chambers. Also, most miners are likely from bitcoin where the issuance rate is a sacred cow and not much discussion would go anywhere on the topic, so it’s not attempted in ETH. The issue would arguably occur if base fee is stripped, ASIC’s still control a very large portion of hashrate, and there is a sea of issuance reduction proposals out there. Honest GPU miners get squeezed from both sides so it feels bad.",
