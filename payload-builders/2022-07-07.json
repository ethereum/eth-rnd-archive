        "content": "Hi! The intent of this channel is indeed to explore research questions around blockspace and block construction. Fee markets are a critical component, but blockspace is more general, encompassing the various actors involved in receiving, ordering, executing or settling end-user transactions. The content of this channel is expected to differ from \u003c#874767108809031740\u003e in that we seek to take a more abstract view of the question, rather than look into the implementation of these ideas, however we expect some overlap and synergies between the two 🙂",
