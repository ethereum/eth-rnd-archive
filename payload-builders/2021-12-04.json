If the problem is block size, so why not just reduce block time by 50% and make it 1 eth reward instead of 2. That's how in theory there would be faster transactions but still same eth rate for miners with more faster and cheaper network",

Once they do that, they (if they’re a miner) can start building the next block. During that time that they’re waiting for the previous block, whoever found it is already trying to find the next one.",
