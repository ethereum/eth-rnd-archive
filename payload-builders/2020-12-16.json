Are barely willing to pay current base fee.\n3. Are trying to sweep their account and maximize how much they get out.",

My feeling is we're getting to the spot where the risk of tweaking the spec will be the main driver of delays, so we should probably keep things as close to what we have now (modulo small things like adding 2718 support, maybe having a better update rule given it doesn't change much of the spec, etc.), get it on mainnet, and we can update the mechanism in a future hard fork once we have real-world data.\n\nAs I mentioned a bit further down, I'm happy with a hard \"no change\" rule at this point",
