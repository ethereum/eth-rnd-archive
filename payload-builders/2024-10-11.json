        "content": "Has there been any research into a final optimal blob target? I think it'd be good to figure this out for L2s to plan around as well as public sentiment and understanding of the end goal.\n\nI understand right now we're planning on raising it from 3 to 5 in order to support blob adoption amongst L2s. However, I do have concern around when we put an end to expanding \"free\" blob space. L2s have a large incentive to keep lobbying for raising the target as it keeps their costs low and revenue high.\n\nFor L2s, having a known final target helps them better plan their go-to-market and growth strategy. From the public sentiment side, many feel the target will continually be raised and there hasn't been any indication on a final target.",
