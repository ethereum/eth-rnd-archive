There are some ways around the censorship resistance as well, but how costly those are remains to be seen. The incentives are certainly such that block producers on both L1 and L2 become centralized if they aren't from the start. I'm still hoping for a \"magic\"  / moon math fix that allows them to stay decentralized 😉\n\nAnother related read for you if you haven't seen it yet: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html",
