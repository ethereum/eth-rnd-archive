E.g. if the base fee is 200 Gwei, and you set both those fields to 500 Gwei, you _will_ pay 500 Gwei per gas (200 of which is burned, 300 goes to miner). If the base fee increases to e.g. , you will still pay 500 Gwei per gas (210 of which will be burned, and 290 of which will go to the miner).\n\nUsers like me (that don't care about position as much) will just use a `maxPriorityFeePerGas` of ~2 Gwei, and set the `maxFeePerGas` to something like 1.5 the current base fee. If the next block happens to be full, I'll get included the one after (or if that one's also full, the one after).",
