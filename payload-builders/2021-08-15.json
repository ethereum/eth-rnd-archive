Many of the spikes in gas fees can be attributed to things like NFT launches, liquidations, or new features that are behind time-locks with a known target block #.  Has anyone thought about the possibility of allowing users to submit transactions for future inclusion (i.e. notBeforeBlock 1234567).  This would give rise to a market similar to AWS EC2 Reserved Instances where tx's submitted early may be eligible for a baseFee discount as an incentive for broadcasting their intent early.",

We see the algorithm handling spikes due to NFT spikes quite well. Miner tips rarely exceed the block reward now which is one of the concerns eip 1559 is trying to solve. \n\nI have had an easy time to put my transactions included within a few blocks just by eyeballing the basefee so far. Hoping the tooling improves within the next few weeks.\n\nOverall I would say it went OK ish. Unless of course the fiasco is that miner rewards are decreased. (Which seems to be where most of the people who says its a complete failure come from).",
