The endpoint to get a payload envelope to sign, should take as input the full execution payload, the execution requests, the withdrawals and not certain about the full blob data. The thing is that the beacon needs to produce a CL state transition to compute the state root and fill in the data, and we cannot count with this beacon having the payload at all since it may not be the one that produced it. I also assume that builders will be running a vanilla beacon node that will be taking these requests and return the object for them to sign and broadcast. I do not see why the builder would not want to run a vanilla validator client for this...",
