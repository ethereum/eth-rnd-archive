        "content": "I have previously argued that 1559 won't lower gas prices.  However, I am starting to think it actually might in some situations.  The speed at which the base fee adjusts when there are underfilled blocks is pretty quick, but with the current gas estimation strategies out there it is easy to get into a situation where everyone is bidding high even though there is room for everyone in the block, just because in the recent past (earlier that day) the blocks were overfull.",
