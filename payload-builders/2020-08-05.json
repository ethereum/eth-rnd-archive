I'm fine with just watching call recordings though, I'm not a big fan of voice/video calls anyway so I don't mind being left out.  🙂",

I hadn't scheduled one yet because it seemed like many streams of work were in progress and I wanted to wait a bit until we had some \"milestones\" to report. Maybe late August is what we should aim for?\n\u003c@!552133098075193354\u003e I think I'm convinced on keeping `FEE_CAP` now.  I didn't realize that `FEE_CAP` could be lower than `BASE_FEE + GAS_PREMIUM`.  With that knowledge, I think `FEE_CAP` as a variable is much more reasonable than I used to think.",
