If fees where $1m, the gas used per block would be close to 0. If gas fees were 0$, then people can freely spam. \nThe base fee moves such that the *demand* for block space reaches about 10M gas instead of miners choosing to include up to 10m gas used. \n\nSay currently the basefee is 70 GWei and it's a stable value, then there will *only* be 10M gas demand for a given block. Miners couldn't even include more txs because these txs don't exist for the current basefee. However, if there is a sudden surge of an additional 5M gas demand at current basefee,  miners will include every single one of these txs since they can go up to 20M gas. At 15M gas demand, there is *no* competition between these transactions, there is enough room to include them all, hence no first price auction. The most rational mining behavior is include 100% of these transactions, whatever above a minimum tip. There is only a first price auction if the demand exceeds 20M gas, which will only happen during surges and will always be temporary, since the basefee will keep increasing until the demand goes back to 10M.",

Since the would see the latest news and hopefully become more involved and generate revenue for development through pool fees   The reason I believe increasing the dag to 5gb would be to eliminate the new 5gb asics. I have come to realize the increase in power consumption from pp would cater to farms and cause centralization.

I accept they should know about 1559 and won't say they are the most knowledgeable when it comes to cypto. Currently since gpu prices have risen due to all that going on in the world roi at residential electric is about 1 year. With 1559 that will extend to atleast 18 months. Not as bad as when the reward reduction was implemented and people bought gpus with 1 month roi, which was stupid, that then change to 2+ years roi. Every time the miners get an advantage it is taken away to benefit holders by artificially increase eth value. That is really not cool at all. Miners  make long term investment as opposed to holder who can dump at exchanges anytime. Also, from 2.1 to 2.01 is 5% less at the same electric cost. Since electric is near half of the mining rewards it is more significant than you are realizing.",
