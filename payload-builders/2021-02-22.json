        "content": "Is this a real economic attack? Sounds interesting.... If miners 51% attack the network by massively increasing gaslimit, they will make more money from MINER_TIP but lose money from uncles and node costs. But that also assumes all miners have equal miner tip requirements and also increase their miner tip requirements by the same amount. We could see a situation where miners with less efficient setups (higher uncle rates) lose more money than others and decide to defect and lower gaslimit.",

Especially given that larger gas limits reduces the base-fee, which can allow use-cases for Ethereum which have been priced out to become viable again as well as promoting the usage of DeFi by smaller users, which would be good for the short-term health of Ethereum.

For example, my pool had to suspend transactions, which involves a lot of dependencies and wastes developer time.*",
