I’m doing some empirical work on whether L2s have acted complementarily or extractively toward the Ethereum L1 since Dencun, and I would appreciate opinions on the results and guidance on additional tests that could be run",

        "content": "Overall I find that there is a Goldilocks zone for L2 activity. This means that  moderate L2 adoption benefits Ethereum’s L1 by unlocking demand that wouldn't exist due to scalability limits. \n\nHowever, at low levels, L2s mainly divert activity from L1. At high levels, congestion and rising costs drive rollups to alternative DA providers like Celestia, reducing Ethereum’s ability to capture value.",
