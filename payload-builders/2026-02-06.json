The `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` takes in a state_root field which is the post state root field after processing the `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` without signature verification. \nBuilders will have to use a beacon-api to generate the envelope. They would have to pass in the payload, blobs bundle etc",
