FPAs are inefficient: if the bids are 1, 2, 5, then it's much more efficient to charge 2 (or 2.0001) to the winner than 5. The main problem w/ doing them on Ethereum is we don't have a trustless way of ordering the bids (e.g. if we do a 2nd Price Auction, miners will just put a bid \u003e the top bid to bump the \"true\" first place to second place and charge that).",
