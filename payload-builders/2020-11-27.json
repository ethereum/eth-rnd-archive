It may be worth adding you as a validator to it as well, and re-running the transaction generation script that \u003c@!574864862338088960\u003e has to make sure everything works properly. It's Friday evening Europe for him, but he can send you the instructions next week 👍",

My personal preference would be to get a large-scale testnet working with the current version (Abdel is working on it and I think we'll have it ready by the call next week), and then update the spec to add 2718 support.",
