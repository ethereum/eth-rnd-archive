Actors will be able to predict that with a lead time of 14s. \n\nSimilarly, the following block will have the max 1.125x price, predictably. The ability to foresee this will allow some parties to use that to their advantage, which mitigates the effect. \n\nThat mitigation is a dampening process (the downward oscillation amplitude is reduced) because the block will now contain the transactions of these active agents. \n\nThe heuristic I am using is induced behaviour change to some minor percentage of participants. Those who use the forecast to modify their fee stand to gain a lot for little cost, and the system benefits from the dampening effect of their action",
