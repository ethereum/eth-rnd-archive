A few tweaks here and there, but in short both are able to create, gossip and process 1559-style blocks and talk to each other ( \u003c@!574864862338088960\u003e ran a private geth \u003c\u003e besu network processing 1559 blocks a few weeks ago: https://twitter.com/PegaSysEng/status/1259919084445204482). IIRC, the geth implementation still uses fixed block sizes and besu has them removed already. As far as I'm aware, no \"core dev\" team aside from Besu is actively working on 1559. Geth isn't, Open Ethereum I don't know and Nethermind were starting to dig into it. \n\nNext steps for implementation IMO are to try and set up a small test network with 20M gas block to see what happens. Hopefully it gives _some_ indication that we can process those types of blocks without things falling over. We also have a call today to discuss how the escalator fits in to all of this, but given the feedback on the last call, I personally would rather not implement a change to 1559 until we have more analysis. If 1559 works at 20M gas, then so will 1559+escalator.",

Barnabe will begin working on more advanced simulations, and I think we should pursue a formal mechanism design analysis to help inform what we do about 1559 vs. escalator vs. (maybe) typed transactions. This will likely take a few months, but IMO if the result is \"1559+escalator is the best!\", it's only a few weeks of engineering effort to update the implementations accordingly (and anyways only for Besu + Vulcanize given other clients won't have started).",
