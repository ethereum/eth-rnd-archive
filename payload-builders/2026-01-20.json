        "content": "Hey folks, picking up from yesterday's call. I updated PR: https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/pull/144 to only specify the various configuration per builder configuration parameters like min-bid, bid-boost etc and a bid selection strategy on how the winning bid is selected from a list of bids. For now we have only defined `max_profit` which is basically the bid with the highest value. \nHow a client does muxes across builders/relays is an impl detail which doesn't have to be spec'ed out. \nI believe it makes sense to standardize these parameters across clients for a better block auction across proposers and builders",
