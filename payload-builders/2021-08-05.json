When people start expecting the current block to be larger than 50%, they expect the next block to have a higher base fee, and so they want to get included in the current block. In fact, they will be willing to pay the miner a higher tip, sometimes even up to 1/8 of the current base fee, to get in the current block rather than the next one. So current block becomes 100% full.\nLikewise for empty blocks. When the current block is expected to be less than 50% full, everyone expects the next block to have a lower base fee. So everyone waits, and the current block becomes empty.",

It's true that people in the same block no longer pay different base fees. But unless you are willing to pay the current base fee (which the average user will often find too high), you need to estimate a base fee that will get you in soon enough. Suppose you don't care about waiting up to 2 minutes, and set a maximum base fee of x. It will sometimes be the case that you get included after 30 seconds and pay x, but you would've gotten in after 90 seconds if you had set a maximum base fee of x/2. If you don't value getting in 60 seconds earlier, you have overpaid by x/2. This is pretty similar to pre-1559 when the average user ended up paying for a higher position inside a block that they did not value.",

This is because block 91 ended up being less than 50% full, so the base fee became cheaper in block 92. And yet 92 was not full, so they could've gotten in at 92 while paying a lower base fee.\nBut of course, when block 91 was being mined, there was no way to know that 91 was going to be less than 50% full. So the user might have expected 91 (and the next few blocks) to be more than 50% full, and wanted to get in before fees increased. He guessed wrong, so he paid for faster inclusion that he did not value much. This is not that different from the type of guesswork that users had to do under FPA pre-1559.",

For regular ETH transactions, a user would probably be fine with this increase because their base ETH value is increasing to offset this higher transaction fee. \n\nHowever, for someone that's doing a transaction on an ERC20 token, they would not enjoy the same ETH appreciation at all but face constant upward pressure on transaction fees.\n\nEventually, token activity will die out as seen by recent failed \"deflationary\" memecoins.

And virtue of the fees being burned, the cost of them paying high gas prices is increased, as there is also less supply of eth than before.\n\nWhen the ETH price becomes higher, willingness to pay the same gas price at that price point may also decrease accordingly. Which will give downard pressure to the basefee.\n\nI do agree on your point that if this persists it is not good, but i dont see it persisting to be honest, and we can probably see it in a week or two.\n\nAnyways, using L2 rollups is cheap and available now.",

But it might not be a big deal because people understand its being burned and so wont complain. But it could have long term effects.. Its hard to say ;D\n\nFor example someone could clone ETH and remove EIP1559. It would be interesting to see if users would eventually transition to that chain because it should in theory be cheaper to use even with the same demand.",
