I was finding that trying to get the EIP to be correct was proving difficult without a compiler and tests to validate the spec itself, so switching to Python ended up being easier.  I would have preferred TypeScript, but I figured Python would go down smoother with others... if I was wrong let me know and I'll happily rewrite it in TypeScript (the type system is much better than Python's type system and thus able to express things better/more clearly).",
