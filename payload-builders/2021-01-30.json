        "content": "If you are a small pool with 1% hashing power and you mine ea block that isn't 2x full, you can choose to either include a payout or not include a payout.  In either case, your revenue from the rest of the block remains constant (there is no opportunity cost in terms of other transactions that could have been included).  You do have to pay the `base_fee`, but your decision here will affect how many transactions the *next* block can include because if you include a payout it will increase the `base_fee` for the following block slightly, which means slightly fewer transactions will be valid for the next block miner.",
