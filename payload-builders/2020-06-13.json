Because it seems critics amplify the 5% (e.g. \"but users will escalate!!\" \u003c\u003c that's me 🤪) or downplay the 95% (e.g. \"status quo works too during that 95%\").  OTOH proponents would amplify the 95% (e.g. \"dat elasticity dough\") or downplay the 5% (\"well you get what you paid for, just wait the BASEFEE will come down\") ... so the debates go in circles.",
