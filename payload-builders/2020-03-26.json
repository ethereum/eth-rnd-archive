I am working on a simulation environment for EIP 1559, I have some code and a notebook (also serves for me to explain how this works). It's too long while some parts are underdeveloped but if you want to see how it's shaping up feel free to take a look here: https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eip1559/eip1559.ipynb",
