Just the consensus protocol will change.\n\n\u003e  and what will be the block reward in eth 2.0 which will go to stakers?\nNot 2 ETH per block if that's what you're wondering. The reward issued to stakers will remain the same as it is now (see e.g. https://beaconcha.in for what rewards are currently issued). \n\nIssuance goes from ~4% inflation with PoW to ~0.5% with just PoS after merge iirc. (Currently we have both in parallel, so ~4.5%)",
