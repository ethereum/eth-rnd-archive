I wrote a simple PR to the builder-specs against the staked builder api to define a whitelisted builder configuration spec across clients: https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/pull/144 this has been inspired from: https://hackmd.io/@tchain/payment-config\nWould love to get a check from clients on:\n1. Whether we want to deprecate MEV-Boost in glamsterdam. I think we can have a discussion on how it would be to absorb mev-boost into clients. \n2. Whether we need to specify the cnofiguration passed to clients to keep it standardized across implementations.",
