Current perfnet for crazy scenarios which will expose much more clearly some issues around processing single tx types or about block building - high gas limit, short slot, current state as is.\n2. More mainnet aligned perfnet - with shadowfork from mainnet one to get it's state, 12 sec slot and initially 60MGas. Here we will try to get as much interesting cases as possible to ensure we are fine on 60 - once we will stabilize the set of tests we will let you know about more details and once agreed that current set is \"fine\" we will start moving higher step by step - 70, 80 etc\n\nWe also got few issues on Nethermind's plate based on perfnet findings and will analyze everything once more to give some more details for each team - and happy to get any insight from all of you about what was already spotted by you based on your analysis (I know Geth, Reth and Besu at least connected to perfnet and had some interesting findings already).",
