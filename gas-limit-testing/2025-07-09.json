Think pretty important right?\nI was playing around with this yesterday in geth, this might be a good starting point: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/32174\n\nEssentially tried out a few different methods:\n\n- ModExp using GMP where object allocations are done on the C side and a go struct stores pointers\n- Same as above, but using a sync.Pool to re-use GMP allocations\n- A modexp method written in C that uses GMP, so there is only one cgo call\n\nTLDR; There was at most a 2x speedup on the benchmarks with GMP vs big.Int and GMP was expectedly slower on small bit sizes",

Can try it out with the branch linked to confirm though",
