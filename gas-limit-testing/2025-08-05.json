Reth crashes (3 times over a whole test cycle) - sent some details on our TG group already.\n2. Besu is very slow at \"Mod\", \"ModArith\", \"binopsimple\" test cases (below 15MGas/s)\n3. Nethermind does not work at all for now (genesis hash mismatch for some reason)\n4. Geth and Erigon looking pretty good and nothing new found - Geth slowest on modexp (slowest 15MGas/s), Erigon on point evaluation precompile and then modexp (above 35 Mgas/s)",
