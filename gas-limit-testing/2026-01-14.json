The issue I see is that over http with newPayload, it could cause issues. Using blockchain tests I see that even with 2 Ggas/s, it is still taking 85 seconds to execute.\n```\n\nethereum/evmtool/build/install/evmtool/bin/evmtool  block-test ~/fixtures/blockchain_tests/benchmark/compute/instruction/account_query/extcode_ops.json\nConsidering tests/benchmark/compute/instruction/test_account_query.py::test_extcode_ops[fork_Prague-benchmark-gas-value_100M-blockchain_test-opcode_EXTCODECOPY]\nBlock 1 (0x89b7d332bc3c0f8c7a8d11e1b54ef90545ba8f60ec1ed5e1dddf57491a35ffff) Imported in 85132.72 ms (2170.79 MGas/s)\nBlock 2 (0x39ee3dc039b6f7d11605564d703f640f522ffc \u003cclipped message\u003e",
