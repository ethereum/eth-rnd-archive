Direct linking to the corresponding blocks. Reach out if you've got questions or want help digging into the data.\n\nThere's a filter for reference nodes, so we can use this as a way to figure out which exact blocks are bad on reference machines on mainnet and then convert those into new benchmarks and eventually stateful tests.\nthis is great. we will try to see whats needed ti integrate ethrex asap",
