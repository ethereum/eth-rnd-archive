But I've ported evmone's code which uses uint32`/`uint64 to Erigon. A quick check locally shows 0–14% mgps improvement.\nKamil had the exact numbers on how much it improved geth -- 0-14% sounds like a reasonable speedup where the higher numbers are likely on smaller modexp operations, since the ratio of gas calculation to modexp calculation would be smaller",
