We could similarly ignore all CPUs less than 64 cores and IOPS less than 1M and figure out how much of a gas limit we can handle, but that isn't useful information.  We can trivially crank up the gas limit by just cranking the hardware requirements to server class, or DC clusters.  If we don't bound the discussion to some set of agreed hardware, it is a pointless discussion, even technically, I think.\nno one is arguing for hardware spec's only possible in a datacenter and no one is treating these issues trivially. the whole point of this chat is to make gas increases rigorous, unlike all of the gas limit increases of the past",

It is frustrating for those of us that want to express thoughts/opinions on the \"should we\" topic because at best we are told to go somewhere no one is listening to shout into the wind.  The reason these \"purely technical' channels keep attracting \"should we\" discussions is because people have learned that is the only way to get heard.  FWIW, I have been on the other side of this discussion in the past (long ago), arguing that we should keep some communication channel purely technical and telling people to \"go somewhere else\" if they want to voice their philosophical disagreement, so I can appreciate your frustration with people like me showing up with \"should we\" comments.\nSo you don't think we should test the software to find bugs and fix them; as its potentially against the direction Ethereum should go?",
