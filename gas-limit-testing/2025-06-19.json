(Or just run the tests, I would like to double check that the repricing gets us safely to 100m for the modexp)\nWe can do it two ways:\n1. Prepare a \"proper\" fusaka-performance branches - a bit more work here as we have some smaller issues which we need to tackle anyways but won't be super fast\n2. Hacky way as @marcin_d_s did - custom branch which applies repricing now so we can check the outcome.\n\nTBH the sooner we will make it the better as yesterday Marcin mentioned that there is some chance that it may still not cover all the paths properly but it may be then more about client improvements rather EIP repricing further.",
