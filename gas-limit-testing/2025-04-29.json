        "content": "I would also point out that there is a big difference between having a network with (e.g.) constant 4 second slot times, and changing a network from 12 second slot times to 4 second slot times at some arbitrary point.  The idea that slot time is a constant is implicit across not just the consensus nodes but the ecosystem as a whole, and changing it at some point could cause significant knock-on effects.\n\nIf it were down me I would look at increasing the per-block gas limit and tweaking the slot intervals to give more time for block propagation and attesting (e.g. 5s for production, 5s for attesting, 2s for aggregating).  The latter is something that has already been discussed and wouldn't be as big a change as it would \"only\" require changes to consensus nodes.\n\nIf there is a desire for shorter slot times it would seem that putting this into something like beam chain would be a better option, where either a lower constant can be selected from genesis, or the design built with variable slot times in mind.",
