Saw your teams PR to gas-benchmarks - that is great!\n\nI added it, not yet pushed onto machine but now during my other tests i triggered ethrex and see it fails pretty fast for EEST test suite with Invalid Sync status for newPayload:\nhttps://github.com/NethermindEth/gas-benchmarks/actions/runs/16802148694/job/47585829416\n\nI see it receives paylaods properly but does not do any processing?\nHi Kamil! Here's a fix for this: https://github.com/NethermindEth/gas-benchmarks/pull/53 It was a very small benchmark script bug on our side. I tested locally and eest tests seem to be running correctly now. Thanks for taking the time to look at it!",
