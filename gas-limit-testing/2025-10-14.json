The EIP isn't saying much about how breaking could it be to cap to this specific value. Also we came across [this doc](https://eips.ethereum.org/assets/eip-7825/analysis) which states that 100k transaction went above the proposed limit. This sounds like a lot, and it's very difficult to make sure that preventing them wouldn't irreversibly break stuff. Would appreciate any clarification, thanks in advance!\n\ncc \u003c@687974325072035882\u003e \u003c@792404665068158998\u003e \n\nPS: sorry if it's not the right channel.",

Blocks with such txs are the worst-case blocks, even if we can parallelize execution (after glamsterdam and eip 7928).",
