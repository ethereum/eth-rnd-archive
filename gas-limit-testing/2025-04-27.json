Can we please keep the conversation specifically on optimization related topics? Else I suggest mods to adjust the channel rules/participants for the goal of the channel. We are talking about 1) data collection via devnets/benchmarks 2) techniques we can use to make our software faster or identify breaking points.",

We have a grantee looking into what state growth does to our db implementation (pebble) and encourage other clients to do something similar\nI do agree with Marius here, State growth is not only about disk growth, but also about other aspects (db degradation, snap sync effect). We need better data here",
