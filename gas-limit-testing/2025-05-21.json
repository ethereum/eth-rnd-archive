The lower you go, the more exponentially difficult decreasing the slot time is and returns get exponentially lower\nfor human interfaces there are huge diminishing returns once you approach 100-200ms. but before that can make the difference between something feeling interactive or not\n\nfor MEV many forms of MEV scale as sqtr(slot_time) so 1s would cut the value extraction by 2.4x compared to 6s\n\nfor interop lower slot times will make the L1+L2 feel like one unified chain because L1\u003c--\u003eL2 interop will become lower friction. also any use cases taht use L1 as message bus between L2's\n\nlowering the slot time will definitely be labor intensive but I don't think we're anywhere near diminishing returns and so I don't think anyone can say with certainty where the diminishing returns will start to really kick in",
