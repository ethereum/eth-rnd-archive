We have a working prototype but found multiple pitholes in that approach without structure of EOF. Still experimenting with some mitigation strategies, static compilation (and distributing dll's), and few other stuff.  The lack of structure in EVM bytecode is very problematic, because you can emit huge functions but if they are huge no compiler will optimize them.",

We used to experiment with this back in the day but then found that any JIT optimizer will have to deal with pathological codes that make it run very slow.\nYeah this is just running the Evm opcodes in advance to PGO them (Profile-guided optimization); and then pick up the second compilation after they've been re-optimized.\n\nNot doing smart contracts (which is different project we are doing; and made harder by contracts being 28kB of unstructured random jumps; something something EOF something)",
