IMO there's a lot of value to be discussing these improvements in an open way, as it is one of the most requested things by the community. \n\nThat said, I realize there are some more sensitive/speculative scenarios we may want to discuss privately. I'd propose having a separate, private, chat for just EL devs to go into these details, but default to have everything that can be public here.\n\nIf people are OK with that, I can create a separate chat and change the group names to make it clear which is which 😊",
