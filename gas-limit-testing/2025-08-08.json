Saw your teams PR to gas-benchmarks - that is great!\n\nI added it, not yet pushed onto machine but now during my other tests i triggered ethrex and see it fails pretty fast for EEST test suite with Invalid Sync status for newPayload:\nhttps://github.com/NethermindEth/gas-benchmarks/actions/runs/16802148694/job/47585829416\n\nI see it receives paylaods properly but does not do any processing?\nHi Kamil, thanks a bunch for including ethrex in the tests. We hadn't run the EEST test suite in this context, we'll fix this ASAP.",
