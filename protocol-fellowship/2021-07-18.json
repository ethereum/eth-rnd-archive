With just plain openssl and without any tweak but optimizing my code I managed 270ms to hash that state vs 290ms of fastssz. Using something like bitcoin's implementation of hashing two blocks at once with sha extensions I get less than 250ms, that's now considerably faster than fastssz. My cpu can do 4 at a time and modern intels can 8, this is without any parallelization, only one cpu. I was hoping to implement 4 at a time on mine and benchmark against nimbus and lighthouse before my kids holidays (which means forced holidays for me as well) but couldn't. Next week I'll post those results. My project requires at least being at par with the existing clients and beat them in the parts that it doesn't follow the spec. At least in this topic I know I'm hashing at least 25% faster than prysm. This doesn't include cache algorithms that's what actually matters, but I'll get there. \u003c@539495253418180618\u003e I'll bug you to explain me how to benchmark lighthouse",
