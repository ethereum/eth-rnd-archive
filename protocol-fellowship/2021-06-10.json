I get that in this round, there were far too many applicants to evaluate technical merrit beyond just looking at githubs. However, I think you should reevaluate that for the next round, if you want to entice experienced developers that want to start contributing to open-source code. \n\nTo use myself as an example, I have more than a decade (closer to 2, actually) of programming experience. However, 99% of it was closed-source, and mostly under NDA. Typically, large corporations like Google or Microsoft also have contracts that prevent real open-source contribution without jumping through hoops, as by default any of my ideas were owned by my employers.",
