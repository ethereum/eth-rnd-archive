But I can not use it as a variable input for the trace_transaction api since the api uses a TxHash object as input. I have tried to find TxHash object definition or examples for Json but no luck, any idea ? All info found so far is general. Thanks a lot ! This is in nethermind. \nAny info please DM. I will keep digging",
