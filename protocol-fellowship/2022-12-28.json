Each call will be dedicated to discussion with a mentor from different team or research area. They are open to answer all of your questions, so I would like to ask you to prepare some questions in advance. \n\nThe first AMA on Tuesday is going to be with Piper Merriam! If you are not sure who Piper is, trust me, he is an Ethereum legend. He has been contributing to Ethereum since early days, created this very fellowship program and recently, he pioneered Portal Network. I hope you will treat him with some interesting questions 🙂 \n\nCheck call details here: \nhttps://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/issues/239",
