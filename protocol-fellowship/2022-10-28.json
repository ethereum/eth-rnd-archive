I am working on reading the go-ethereum protocol and find if I can work with some mentors who are familiar with this part. For my brief idea is that our team has already found the attack happening in Ethereum mempool, so I want to harden the admission rules. I would appreciate it if any mentors can give me some advice on it.\nAlso, If anyone is interested in this work, fill free to join us.",
