POAPs are event based NFTs which prove your participation.\n\nThe only requirement: write up your **showcase profile**! This is important for wrapping your participation in the program \u0026 informing how we approach future cohorts. The deadline will be **Nov 15**, so please do it soon - especially if you received funding support 🙏 \n\nSee Piper's example and add yours here: https://github.com/ethereum-cdap/cohort-zero/tree/main/showcase",
