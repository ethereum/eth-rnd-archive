Please make sure to check the mentorship guide first https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/blob/master/program-guide/mentors.md\nGenerally we recommend doing your own research about the topic before reaching out to mentors and also, as the program did not officially started (we are still in week 0, preparation/learning phase), mentors might not be available yet. Please feel free to post your question here and tag corresponding mentor or reach out to me for some initial feedback and based on that I can connect you to the right mentor.",

In this pull request I created a pie chart to display how many nodes are on the network and which clients they are so trin, fluffy, ultralight and unknown. Before it had a linear runtime complexity with respect to the number of rows that are in the database which means it would take longer and longer the larger our database grows. But I have fixed this issue with the code to solve the linear run time complexity by first creating pier sql that solves this issue then converting it to sea-orm there are still more changes I need to complete before this can be merged . Just thought I would give a update and now I thinking of other interesting data that would be interesting to display through different graphs.",
