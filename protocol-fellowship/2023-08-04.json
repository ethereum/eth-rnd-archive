Next two Office Hours calls will be dedicated to presenting your project proposals. It's a space to share your proposal with other fellows and also invite mentors to see and feedback your goals. Please aim for 10-15 minute presentation with some space for questions, we are hoping to have room for 3-4 people in this call. If you plan to present, please just leave comment under the issue  https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/issues/137",
