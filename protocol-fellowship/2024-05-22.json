See abstract and bio below.\n\n https://stanford.zoom.us/j/99145577374?pwd=LzJaUzRtMTBRMWhrZHJCVGFLcEEzZz09\n\n———————\nAbstract: Designing good Internet protocols is hard. Designing protocols that actually get deployed is harder. We take a look at some protocols that have been widely deployed (e.g., TLS 1.3, QUIC, and the WebPKI), and some others which have been less so (e.g., IPsec, SCTP, and DNSSEC/DANE) and draw some lessons about the factors that lead to protocol success and failure.\n\n\nBio: Eric Rescorla has contributed extensively to many of the core security protocols used in the Internet, including TLS, DTLS, WebRTC, ACME, and QUIC. He was editor of the TLS 1.3 protocol, which secures the vast majority of Web traffic and co-founder of Let's Encrypt, a free and automated certificate authority that is now the largest on the Internet.  He is the former Chief Technology Officer for Firefox and Internet Platform at Mozilla, where he was responsible for setting the overall technical strategy for the Firefox browser and Mozilla's participation in Internet standards and global policy.",
