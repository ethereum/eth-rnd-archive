Because a lot of things might just involve reading articles / papers and maybe building a PoC (if required).",

        "content": "Hey, thanks for the question! \nSure there are many domains to explore which are only suitable for research and cannot be properly implemented yet. It depends on what you are researching - potentially you can work on implementation of a proposed solution or maybe you need to propose a completely new solution to existing problem, therefore write a paper, create specification. It might require building PoC or some naive implementation as you mention, some maybe other hands on challenges like data analytics, benchmarks, math..  Checkout discussions at ethresear.ch and projects from previous cohort.",
