        "content": "Hey, network simulation is exactly what I do - Using shadow (https://shadow.github.io/) to simulate various configurations and then comparing them with the captured metrics (bandwidth, consensus stability across the network, etc). Up until now, I put my focus on PeerDAS, but with the discussion about blobs going on and the importance of IDONTWANT being discussed again, I started some simulations to compare the bandwidth requirements of 3/6 vs 4/8 with a varying number of nodes using IDONTWANT. I hope to have the data out before next ACD.",
