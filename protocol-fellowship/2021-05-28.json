Most of my dev work has been done in JavaScript (vanilla JS, Node.js, and React.js) and I’ve been diving into TypeScript recently.  I’ve learned a bit about computer science concepts on my own, and I’m happy to do a deep dive on whatever area of the Eth protocols that I can have the most impact.  I look forward to working with you all!  Aloha.",

I was a machine learning engineer for a couple years, but couldn't resist building the cypherpunk future and I am currently building an mvp for a new defi product. I like python, c++, rust, and also play around with some functional languages for fun and (non)profit. I'm also a surfer. Cheers. Excited about the program and hope to meet some cool people",

If now a transaction \"swoops in\" and sets the storage slot to something different, you can't predict which state will be modified by your program",
