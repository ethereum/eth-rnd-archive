        "content": "My goal:\n\nI want to enable multiple SCW implementations in the chrome extension that I am making. For this, every SCW implementation will have to write a walletAPI. An example of such wallet API - https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/SimpleAccountAPI.ts#L28\n\nSince these implementations can be arbitrary and can be written by anyone, they must run in a safe environment, for this purpose I intend to use SES. I am not sure what is the best way to integrate with this API.\n\nMy first thought was to create a Compartment in the background script \u0026 then load the wallet API in a compartment in the background script. But currently, since Manifest v3, eval is not available in the background scripts I see this issue - https://github.com/endojs/endo/issues/1380 which states that we cannot have a compartment without unsafe-eval in CSP. \n\nIf someone here can help me with the best design for implementation it would be super helpful.",
