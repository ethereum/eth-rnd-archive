Also its given this way (in the form of (m,n)) further in the yellow paper (attaching screen shot), came across it later today. And n does not seem to be the nonce (I had assumed it was too), i tired reading the proof of work function, but it seems like i'll need a phd in maths to understand it fully.

And I agree with your second point - I went back and read the equations 168-171 again and it seems like n _is the block header nounce_. These 4 equations also use B instead of H to denote the block headers, which made a little more confusing for me as B is used to refer to the whole block in previous paragraphs (equation 19 on page 5).",
