Historically, the protocol has limited each topic/subnet to a message payload of common interest for everyone subscribed to the topic/subnet. \n\nIn the case of danksharding, however, there might be multiple custody columns/rows distributed in the same subnet and not all subscribers would be interested in all columns/rows distributed. Would it in this case make sense to add some context to the `message-id`? Can this problem be circumvented in some-other way (like playing around with the custody requirement size and the number of columns/rows)?",
