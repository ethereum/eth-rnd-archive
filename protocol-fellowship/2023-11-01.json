EPF requires projects to be licensed as Free and Open Source Software. It's really just a minor task of choosing one and adding the license doc to your repo. I noticed some of your repos don't have a license so just a reminder to be aware of that. \nJust reach out if you are not sure or check out licensing tips from FSF https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html",
