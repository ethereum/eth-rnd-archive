I can probably grab Szymon who is the original author of this code too.\n\nNote that we are leveraging excellent run-time reflection, including code generation in .Net here. Which is not that easy in some other languages/frameworks/platforms.\n\nAt least until now, this was explored with a purpose to ship it in Nethermind client as we are focusing on applied engineering rather than just research.",
