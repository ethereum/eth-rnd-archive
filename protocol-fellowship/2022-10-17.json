My aim is to get a deep dive into the protocol, get used to the codebase, toolings, etc, also document my journey and why not end up contributing something through a coding project. I've seen some of the resources listed on suggested reading within the cohort repo and I'm still wondering what would be the best way of getting onboarded into core development. Should I go straight to yellow paper, there's a beige paper (might be outdated compared to the latter). I also found this course https://ethereumstudymaster.com/courses/ethereum-2-0-studymaster-program/. Do you find it relevant?",
