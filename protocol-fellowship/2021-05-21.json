I started out programming for satellites in C++/Python (1 launched running my code in 2018, another launches via SpaceX next year), then moved to doing corporate DevOps specializing in air-gapped environments, then launched a social iOS app, then realized decentralization is the future of finance so now I'm here! Looking forward to contributing and learning with everyone.",

I was doing a masters in maths here before I left to start a VR technology company, where we developed a novel deep learning architecture to generate photo-realistic 3D avatars from a single 2D photo, along with a custom renderer that allows for rendering photo-realistic virtual worlds on mobile GPU's.  We also integrated Ethereum into our platform (ERC20 and ERC721 tokens), allowing users to tokenize their virtual worlds and in-game art, which is what made me fall in love with Ethereum. We were acquired recently. I'm super interested in working on the EVM changes that need to be made for ETH2.",
