        "content": "https://purified-web3.box has resources focusing on it including a TG group. the initial scope for EL boils down to:\n\n- add logs to ETH transfers\n- implement the 7745 log index\n- when building/receiving payload for CL, use SSZ\n- when hashing, use SSZ\n\nGeth is currently farthest with 7745. The SSZ scope was prototyped in EthJs.\n\nThe idea is to keep extending the devnet until it is complete, so that Helios / Nimbus / Corpus Core can verify the entire RPC API efficiently. Those tools can then be integrated into wallets and dApps to improve security and privacy, and also help reducing the need for external indexers and gas fees e.g. when verifying a log from an L2 receipt on L1.\n\nWhich EL are you interested in looking into?",
