        "content": "since there are multiple people in the fellowship interested in verkle tries I wanted to share that there is a in-progress repo of Verkle tries in Java:\nhttps://github.com/Quadratic-Labs/VerkleTries_Besu\n\nIf anyone is interested in helping on this please ping me, project only started. To give you a context: The purpose of this repo is to have a standalone verkle tries library in Java which will later be used for Besu execution client. \u003c@353136597522448385\u003e (he's leading the verkle tries implementation) mentioned that Besu implementation is a high prio and Besu team is lacking resources right now.\n\nWork is sponsored by OnlyDust, so when your PRs get accepted you should be able to claim rewards. Cryptographic primitives will be used as a JNI wrapper either from rust or go (ipa_multipoint or go-ipa libraries). So we only need verkle trie logic, there is no need to get deep into polynomial commitments. Since we only started, it would be useful to onboard new people.\n\nNote that I'm not leading the java project, but would be happy to help anyone interested. There is also a tg group, there are people from Besu happy to help too, so feel free to ping me to connect you.",
