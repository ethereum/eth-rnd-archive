To my understanding, this would include efforts that are too high priority, efforts where there is little work left to be done, efforts where the technical barriers to entry are too high, or efforts that were abandoned in favor of stronger alternatives",

        "content": "I have a cool project (1 or 2 days) for someone with experience in web development + web3\nSo for the testnets we usually deploy a forkmon e.g. https://forkmon.ethdevops.io/\nWhich shows the state of the network/ which node is on which fork etc.\nI just implemented a new RPC call `debug_burned` which shows the amount of ether burned by EIP-1559 which is scheduled for the upcoming London fork and I would love to have a site similar to the forkmon which just shows this for the last 10 blocks individually and for the overall. \nThis would be really cool for the testnet forks (and maybe later for mainnet)\nSo if you're interested in working on that, ping me. I'll try to assist as much as possible, but I am not good in webdev\n(edit: CDAP link https://github.com/ethereum-cdap/cohort-zero/issues/51)",
