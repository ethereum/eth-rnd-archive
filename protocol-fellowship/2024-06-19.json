        "content": "I got some questions regarding servers for fellows we mentioned yesterday and there was some discussion in the specs thread so I wanted to elaborate on this.\n\nWe can provide an aws instance or similar from EF devops for certain projects. It's mainly meant for EPF projects which require running a server throughout the fellowship, e.g. fuzzer and crawler in last cohort. It's not quick on-demand setup, needs to be requested in advance so if you just want to try something out or test your work on client codebase, you should use a local testnet. \n\nI believe there is no need for a public or powerful machine for vast majority of development on clients. You shouldn't run a mainnet node for development and not even big public testnet unless you are testing for some specific long running case. Use tools like Kurtosis to run dev environment and test your changes. If you need a public network, use Ephemery testnet which is tiny and syncs instantly. If you need access to RPC for mainnet data, you can reach my Prague archive node at https://bordel.xyz. Dan also offered some form of access to nodes so I believe we got this covered. \n\nI can also suggest some cheap providers where you can get fast on demand vm anonymously for crypto if you still want a vps to have a remote server with public IP on your own. If you need anything or have any questions, please feel free to DM!",
