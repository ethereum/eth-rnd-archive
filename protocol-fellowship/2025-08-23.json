        "content": "Hi everyone, \nThis might be interesting for people who need to read specs. \nI created a knowledge graph visualisation for fulu consensus specs. It has helped me understand fulu a bit better and acts as a visual aid while going over any fulu entity by showing which other entities it relates to.\n\nSo you can search for any entity you want in the search bar and it will show you that node. Once you click on a node, the node and its neighbours get highlighted. If you hover over any edge, it gives details on the relation between the entities, e.g. `DataColumnSidecar` *`uses`* `signed_block_header`.\n\nI plan to do this for other forks/specs too once this version is improved.\nWould love to get any feedback on this.\nhttps://githubgitlabuser.github.io/specs-knowledge-graph/fulu_real_knowledge_graph.html",
