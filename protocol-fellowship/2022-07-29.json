The gap should grow steadily with each block, then suddenly jump closer when a new epoch is finalized, then start drifting apart again.  Since Sepolia is a closed validator set is there any way for us to \"chaos monkey\" the validators to cause the  2-finality or even 3- or 4- finality scenarios described in https://eth2book.info/altair/part3/transition/epoch#finalisation ?\nhttps://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/692062809701482577/1002668292449771611",
