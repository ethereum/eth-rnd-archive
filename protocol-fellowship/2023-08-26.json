I'm just learning more about the Portal network in general but added initial thoughts on how this implementation can help achieve this in a prototype way. https://github.com/sogolmalek/EIP-x/issues/5. I'm genuinely excited about combination of this component with our other state provider component, which generates and propagates a zk proof of last state to the LCs . In case of cache inconsistencies or failures, participants can fall back on the ZK proofs of the latest state to validate the correctness of cached fragments. This integration ensures network resilience and the ability to independently verify state accuracy.  https://ethresear.ch/t/implementation-overview-of-partial-state-caching-mechanism/16483",
