My name is Eamon, I work as nurse, but have been rooting around down here in the crypto rabbit hole for a while now and was starting to re-learn my basic networking/web dev skills (from an old associates program years ago) to get into the developer side when the pandemic started. Have tried to continue to but, work... I’m super excited to have heard about this on Bankless podcast and am thrilled to get a chance for consideration on learning and transitioning out of nursing and into blockchain technology with this program! Thank you for the opportunity! Reading a bunch of the messages about everyone’s skills and knowledge is exciting: to get to potentially work along side you all and ensure Ethereum’s place in the growing global digital economy and the benefits of decentralization that it brings to humanity would be incredible!",
