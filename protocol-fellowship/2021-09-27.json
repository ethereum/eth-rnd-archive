I'm not sure if anyone is actively working on this.  The \u003c#595701319793377299\u003e channel is probably a good place to start.  I know that the `trin` implementation of the portal network would be interested in having a rust-based implementation of a beacon chain light client.\n\nThe portal network is the active initiative for light clients for the execution chain.  That effort spans across multiple teams.  You can find the dedicated discord in the \u003c#796057759858425866\u003e channel.  The `trin` implementation is reasonably saturated with contributors.  I would look into the Fluffy, Geth, and Javascript implementations if you want to help there.\n\nI'll also highlight this document I wrote on how to help with open source projects which is probably a good read for everyone: https://github.com/ethereum-cdap/cohort-zero/issues/78",
