Glad to see initiatives like this one, find communities willing to help people learn and get involved into the protocol development. I'll be exploring the discord and channels in the meantime, have learned already a ton of things just by poking around inside conversation threads. Cheers!",

I started out learning about bitcoin blockchain, and how blockchain tech works, but where can I learn more about eth protocol? (i've read white paper and started yellow) what does the eth protocol consist of?",
