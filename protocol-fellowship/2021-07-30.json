        "content": "any assembly wizard here? I've implemented my code in AVX2 and it's good enough to benchmark on my AMD RYZEN CPU. This CPU natively supports SHA extensions so naturally the AVX2 version is slower. But still, it works at par with Lighthouse for example using SHA extensions.  And this is the problem, I want to benchmark against clients in the same situation, so I want to benchmark against LH without using SHA extensions.  However, if I run it on my laptop, which does not support SHA but does support AVX2, the code segfaults. Now here's the catch: if I compile without optimization and debug symbols it does not segfault, so is not in the assembly itself, but rather in its interaction with the C++ code. This is the kind of horrible things to debug that brought me to math instead of coding in the first place.",
