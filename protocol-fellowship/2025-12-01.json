Just kidding, imagine a Monday with no call! 🙂 \n\nHope you all got some rest and decompressed after Devconnect, it was amazing meeting you all in person. Thank you so much again for all great presentations and incredible work you did in past few months. \n\nI just wanted to remind you that we are always here for you and you can reach out if you need to discuss something. This is the last time you are getting notified with your EPF role, you are going to become alumni now. We also have a telegram group for alumni, please DM if you are not there. \n\nAnd last reminder to publish final report, I merged all pending PRs and the table is almost full but few of them are missing. It's in your own interest to have something to show for, please publish some report while it's still in your fresh memory",
