It's super hard for me to come to the stand-ups due to my day-job and children, but I'm posting dev updates here: https://github.com/ethereum-cdap/cohort-one/blob/master/development-updates.md#taylor\n\nTL;DR I'm hyperfocusing on zk-rollups that incorporate smart contracts. and the architecture/workflow. Delving into improving tech documentation that helps support L2 adoption and usability. Also, looking into tooling needed for L2 adoption like solidity-\u003ecairo compiler tools (like the  Warp project here: https://github.com/NethermindEth/warp)",
