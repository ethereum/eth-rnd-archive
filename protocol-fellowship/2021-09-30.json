Is there any example that applied similar export functions? How to create a local dev environment that can run on a laptop or a similar environment? After diving a little like this, I will zoom out and reconsider my high level understanding of the ongoing projects.",

Its goal is to understand light client for beacon chain. We want to start from first principles to understand what is missing before beacon chains are implementable on Eth2 clients.\n2. It is a place for us answer each other's basic questions. Feel free to ask super super basic questions. Even if you could find out the answers yourself, it could be helpful for us to explain them to each other.\n3. We will look to have a few live \"study sessions\" in addition to asynchronous messages.\n\n\nPer Piper's suggestion, we will be using #light-client channel for this study group. That channel has not been active for a while.",
