What I have found out so far is that, in the case where `CallStipend` is set to 0, it breaks transactions that were initiated using `.send()` and `.transfer()`. I will be doing deeper analysis on this topic and document it in the next development update.",

        "content": "I did a lot of research into use of general purpose storage networks for stuff like this and back when I did, I ran into the same problem in swarm and IPFS.  The content address they use is not the same content address we use.  For example, the block hash, which is the content address we have available for block headers, is `keccak(rlp(header))` but swarm uses it's own scheme for hashing objects into a content address.  So there was no clear way to use their network for since we don't have the right kind of hash to reference the content within their network.\n\nIPLD seems to solve this by allowing for not only custom hashing schemes to arrive at a content address but also custom ways to structure the data so that you can do more complex addressing schemes that end up being necessary if you want to do things efficiently such as storing merkle trie data.\n\nAnd then the 3rd part is, that you have to actually have access to the data.  In my case, I was looking for ways to be \"lightweight\" but to get access to swarm in a Peer-2-Peer manner, you had to basically implement the full SWARM/IPFS protocol or have some sort of light version of those protocols that you can implement.",
