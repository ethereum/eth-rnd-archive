It would not have been possible like this without everyone's support, and also huge thanks to all the fellows who kept us motivated to keep going and keep learning 🚀 \n\nAm glad to share that me \u0026 \u003c@785811170387951616\u003e will be joining Nimbus as core devs from January. Again thanks to \u003c@686695036733227017\u003e  \u0026 \u003c@914307919699406908\u003e  🔥  for all the support, without which this would not have been possible 😇",

From being a permissionless participant, to being a fellow, and finally getting hired by a client team, the journey was truly magical for me. Excited to be a part of this new journey and give the best of my abilities to the Ethereum Foundation!",
