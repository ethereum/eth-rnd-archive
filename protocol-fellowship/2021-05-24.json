In 2020, I got busy with my day job and I could no longer contribute. I've recently quit my day job and I have decided to take a deep dive in understanding the Ethereum protocol. I recently got to know about this programme from Piper and thought that this exactly what I was planning to do. \nMy primary interest is in understanding the EVM. Although, I'm no stranger to the protocol, I am by no means an expert. I aim to have expert level knowledge about each and every Opcode.\nI'll be starting my research again from 1st June(Currently serving my notice period).\n\u003c@!543900561460822016\u003e  As per Pipers suggestion in \u003c#688075293562503241\u003e about getting eth1 spec'd like `eth2-specs` I wanted to let you know that I'm very much interested in this and I will get in touch with you after 1st June.",
