I found in the link below a comment that says\n\n\u003e Why does the contract at address 1 not have any source code? etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 is the source published somewhere? \n\nand the answer is \n\n\u003e They don't have EVM bytecode: their source code is in the clients themselves, for example Geth\n\nHow come a precompiled smart contract don't have bytecode? are they not executed in the EVM?\n\nIn appendix E of the yellow paper it seems that all precompiles have a predefined gas cost denoted with g_r. Is that right?\n\nSo, in my understanding is that for precompiles the gas is not defined for each opcode but for each contract as a whole. Is this correct?\n\nhttps://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15479/list-of-pre-compiled-contracts",
