I thought having a Turing-complete language like Eth does introduced more flaws than benefits. I didn't see too many use cases for smart contracts either. Eth seemed like Bitcoin but with lots of extra bells and whistles but lacking in novelty. I also worked in cybersecurity briefly in university and read about security vulnerabilities in smart contracts and such.. That began to change once we got into last Summer and saw many DeFi projects built on Ethereum which began offering services typically done by traditional financial intermediaries as well as reading about Eth 2.0 which seeks to streamline many aspects of the protocol which began to convince me that the developers of Eth really were serious about building something that worked, was secure, and revolutionary.",
