By this time you should be finalizing your project proposal and start executing on it. Please open a PR to add your project based on the template to `/projects` directory and use the second table in dev updates file that has dedicated cells for links to your projects. I will provide feedback in the review but feel free to reach out if you have additional questions. \n\nYou can present this and next week at office hours to share your project plan and get extra feedback. Sign up https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six/issues/113\n And also don't forget to share your regular updates here https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1391677419408326656/1391677429998944348",
