        "content": "The core of Teku's argument is that it's more valuable (also for the network) to start attesting early than it is to backfill - this is certainly true for the individual staker, though it also depends a little bit on how far you're willing to trust the initial state that you're given, and how much you value the \"gentlemans agreement\" that we have in place today to _always_ provide blocks as part of the work done to get a reward - ie is it an \"absolute trust\" kind of relationship or more of a \"trust but verify\" - backfilling first ensures that you have checked the signatures and hashes of the blocks that led up to the state as it was given, upping the game to create a \"fake\" world a bit. The UX here also depends a bit on  how efficient we can make backfilling - is it a minute? a day? it's already a lot more efficient to backfill than to process (one hash and one signature per block)",
