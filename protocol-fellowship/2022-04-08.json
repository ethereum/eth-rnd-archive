I felt like it might require a certain degree of engineering background or years of engineering working experience. I am reading through the guide on GitHub page, I could understand it, but not fully understand every point of it. It seems pretty hard to come up with ideas for a certain problem. So I don't know if this program is meant for some professionals.",
