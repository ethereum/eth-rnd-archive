I just haven't found the time to dive back in yet. So happy to collaborate on it! What are you working on? 🙂",

The are some tests that are generated just for a single fork, for example the bls ones: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/tests/generators/bls/main.py#L533-L538 . I assume this means that the functionality/test doesn't change across forks. But on the other hand these tests is repeated for all forks: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/tests/generators/ssz_static/main.py#L84 and as far as I can tell, there is no difference between the tests, they just seem to be repeated?",
