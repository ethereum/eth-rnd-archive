        "content": "My take on this:\n\nThe simplest way to find optimization points is to run a node yourself. While syncing the client, observe the system performance. Take Geth for example, you can profile the software using the standard Go profiling library. You can also look into operations performance (i.e. block commits, block validations, etc) via Prometheus and Grafana.\n\nFrom what I know, there isn't a document for the performance benchmarks of each client. Though occasionally the respective client teams might post some performance benchmark increase on their own X accounts. I believe the reason is that it's hard to get a universal benchmark as they run the nodes on different hardware, and the clients regularly post optimization updates.\n\nIn the past, I tried to look for optimization points as well (primarily on Geth), but it wasn't easy. Most of the core operations are already optimized heavily. To significantly improve certain operations, there might be a need to rearchitect certain modules, which is usually not recommended because it'll break a lot of stuff. Of course, this isn't a discouragement to work on performance optimization work. If I were you, rather than looking at the entire node architecture and finding small optimization points, I'd focus on specific modules and figure out ways to improve them. For example, EIP-4844 was recently introduced and clients have developed a separate mempool for it. Since it's relatively new, there may be more opportunities to improve the overall architecture.\n\nHope that helps 🙂",
