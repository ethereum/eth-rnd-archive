We hope to connect with mentor \u003c@602753420033785856\u003e  and \u003c@361447803194441738\u003e  to figure out how we could help and collaborate with the main implementers at Lighthouse. Would it be useful to have a discord channel for this?\n\nWe think the Prysm design document the other group has done here was a great idea: https://hackmd.io/@pavignol/SJh-plvNo and we'd like to create one similar to this for the Lighthouse 4844 implementation.\n\nThanks and keen to hear your thoughts 🙏",
