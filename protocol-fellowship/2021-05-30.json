I basically work with Java, Python, Javascript and C++. \nAlso have practical knowledge about Solidity and created few DAPP's by following the online courses like CryptoZomibies. Now I want to give my best in improving the core Ethereum protocol by whatever way I can. Going through the yellow paper, it is way too complex but finding my way through by referring few other resources.  Good luck everyone!👍",
