There seems to be some benefit in trying to isolate the consensus critical stuff (block propogation for eth1) from the non consensus critical stuff (sync, history, maybe even tx gossip).  The security requirements for these two categories are very different so having them bundled puts too much overhead on the non-critical stuff and also exposes the critical functionality to problems that arise from the non-critical stuff.\n\nIn a world where the two are separate, issues with state sync, history sync might prevent new clients from joining the network but the network would continue onwards.  In the same vein issues with tx gossip could cause congestion or UX issues, but the network would continue onwards.  I'd love to see the DevP2P `eth` protocol get slimmed all the way down to only the propogation of new blocks, and to move all of the other functionality into different non-critical sub protocols.\n\nI think the other thing that this does is allow for more rapid development and experimentation in these non-critical sub protocols, something that has and continues to be difficult in the current protocol.",

Given the merkleization algorithm my intuition would have been to collect the fields that change the most together. And mostly to the boundaries of the container. This doesn't seem to be the case. Same question applies for serialization. It does seem to me that the ordering of the members actually has an impact. cc \u003c@203220829473996800\u003e who surely thought about this.
