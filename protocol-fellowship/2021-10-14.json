Junior/Senior 🤷   Engineer/Developer/Student/TruckDriver 🤷‍♀️  Person/Dog/Dog-Person 🤷‍♂️ .  You may be able to get some extra credibility by using this program as a way to acquire a fancier title or new resume item.  But this may also backfire on you.  It turns out people do sometimes check references.  Everything in CDAP happens in the \"open\" and it is pretty easy to come and look at the work you've done (or not done) as part of the program.  The best way to succeed here is to just do the work and do it well.",
