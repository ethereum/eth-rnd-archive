There are teams working on compilers for Solidity, Fe, Vyper, then there are zkevms and zk native VMs with their own langs but that would go outside of EPF scope. You can also checkout some EVM related EIPs and who worked on them because there are different people contributing towards it, not just Ipsilon, e.g. Uniswap labs..\n\nBut generally, you don't need to know what team does what, the goal now is to preperly research the topic and there can be various people who can help you during the project execution.",
