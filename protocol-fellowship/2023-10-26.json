        "content": "Hi guys, one question related to the EVM. I'm analyzing EVM bytecode taken from ethereum sepolia testnet and I find a lot of opcodes that do not correspond with any known opcode.\n\nThey are not valid opcodes, I think it's possible to upload a contract that has invalid opcodes and the EVM should revert when it finds a not known opcode. Then I found out that there is a specific opcode that is 0xFE which is the INVALID opcode.\n\nWhat is the difference between INVALID 0xFE opcode and all others not known opcodes? I mean, the EVM reverts in all cases, but, a part from that, are there any other differences? And also what is the rational behind having the INVALID 0xFE opcode?",
