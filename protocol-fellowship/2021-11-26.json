Got two more potential use cases(patents/copyright)\n\n\nGot some better view/feedbacks/ideas around the same during discussion in #general at Ethereum Cats \u0026 Herders.  Next Im planning to explore more on getting the `Understand the relationship between ideas and patents` and understand the infrastructure/architecture and in-depth study of `NFTs`.(NFT use case is somehow related to use case of my proposal)\n\nAlso had a bried discussion/chat with Anett Rolikova founder of Ethereum Magicians. She's currently working https://www.nftstandards.wtf/\n\u003e Wiki of NFT Standards and everything related to Non Fungible Tokens, infrastructure, vulnerabilities, ideas, metadata\nI will be helping her in improving the documentation of NFTs also which will help me gain better understanding of NFTs.\n\nNothing much for the week. I am occupied in shifting to a new place, since the offices here have reopened post COVID.",
