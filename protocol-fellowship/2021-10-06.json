I would like to participate and help with this. \n\u003c@364458974906548225\u003e I do have two concerns: since I was not selected for the funding/salary program cohort 1, is there a problem if I participate on this and try to get a job out of it by the end of the program ?\nLast one: is there a conflict if I am an investor ? \nThanks !",
