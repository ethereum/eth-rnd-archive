        "content": "Hello All, Happy Sunday!  I'm delighted to share my Week 1 update! I've been working on Stateless AA architecture /Flow and had a great conversation with S1na. we came up with a brilliant idea to introduce a new entity \"**trustless State provider**\" that allows transactions participate in alt-mempool without needing to hold the entire state. To give some highlights please check my post : https://ethresear.ch/t/proposing-new-entity-for-stateless-account-abstraction-trustless-state-provider-allowing-txs-to-enter-alt-mempool-without-hodling-the-whole-state/16128 Additionally I've *** added first Issue on Github, elaborating the idea for this entity***: https://github.com/sogolmalek/EIP-x/issues/1 .  This week, I'd dive deeper and examine feasibility. I'd be very happy to have a discussion with **ZK- experts** here  who are interested to help me develop and evolve with entity! i believe this State provider  can generally unlock more use cases in the context of Ethereum statelessness. 🤩",
