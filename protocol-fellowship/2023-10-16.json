I have most of it done, but there's something I don't understand:\n\nOne of the conditions for returning `{status: ACCEPTED, ...}` is: \"Ancestors of a payload are known and comprise a well-formed chain.\" However, the spec doesn't seem to specify the course of action when this condition isn't met, but all other conditions are. This is the `??` red block in the bottom right corner of the diagram.\n\nWhat should I put in that block?\n\n(Also, any other feedback is greatly appreciated `:)`)",
