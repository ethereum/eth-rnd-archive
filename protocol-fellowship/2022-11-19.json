        "content": "it's not that black and white imo, and there is a difference between private and exclusive pools too. Private pools with strong guarantees with respect to how the user transaction is dealt with might be the only way to ensure that the value exposed by a user transaction is rebated to the user in the first place. the problem with exclusive pool (in my definition) is that they will use their information monopoly to extract as much value as possible for themselves\n\nthe public mempool is great for transactions that don't induce a race to extract value from them, e.g., a transfer or interacting with a contract where transactions are \"parallel\", they don't fight with one another over some limited resource, e.g., pool liquidity, but when there is a complex allocation problem (e.g., who gets which assets at which price) i've become more and more convinced that it's not a good solution",
