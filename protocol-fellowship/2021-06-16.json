I made really rough notes in a few new \"issues\" in the cohort-zero repository.  I'd encourage everyone to check those out and to listen to the recording of today's call (see \u003c#739145593762611250\u003e channel and maybe ask \u003c@!601121887141232672\u003e ).  Some need for proo-of-concept implementations of things, some stuff that's data analytics on the current chain.",
