I’m running Ephemery on my local machine — Lodestar works well, but Geth can’t find peers. Before this, I tested my PC with a mainnet full node, and everything worked fine — ports and firewalls are all properly set up. I’ve also tried some solutions suggested by ChatGPT (o3), but the issue persists. I am not sure whether is caused by parameters or the network. I’d appreciate your help with this! Here are the logs and config: https://gist.github.com/brucexu-eth/820ef6abdfaf134199c67a178d510f69. Thanks a lot!",
