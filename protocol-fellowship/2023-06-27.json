Just dropping in to say hi. \nI will try to participate in the community in the coming days.\n\nBTW I want to hopefully add an additional resource to the yellowpaper reading list at this link (https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/blob/master/program-guide/reading.md#yellow-paper)\n\nCan I create an issue to discuss this?",
