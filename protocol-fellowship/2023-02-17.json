        "content": "Hello world! 👋 \n\nCould you tell me if the office hours call (https://meet.ethereum.org/epf-office-hours) is open to literally anyone, please?\n\nI'm interested in starting to explore the Ethereum ecosystem in a more technical details, and eventually be able to contribute in a non-trivial manner, and potentially apply to one of the future Fellowship cohorts.\n\nAlso, I wanted to ask if there's a link somewhere to the ongoing projects from the current cohort, because I would like - on my own time - to attempt working on some of the project ideas (https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md) which haven't been picked up by Fellowship participants.\n\nAlternatively, instead of a link, could you tell me if the \"Security System based on Machine Learning\" (https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md#security-system-based-on-machine-learning) has been picked up by anyone, and if not - if it would be okay for me to start thinking (again, on my own time) about possible ways I could contribute along the lines of such project (outside of the context of the Fellowship programme)?\n\nThanks very much for your time and understanding! 🙏\n\nP.S.: Apologies if this isn't the correct channel/server for my question(s). If that's the case, could you please provide a reference to the correct one, so that I could move my questions there?",
