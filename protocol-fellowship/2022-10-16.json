If we make an AA wallet, I would personally want to override that, since now `eth_sendTransaction` should internally do a `eth_sendUserOperation`. \n\nI am interested in knowing if you had a plan on how do you want to make AA wallet with MM-snaps.\n\nWe can add a new RPC method `eth_sendUserOperation` but then Dapps will have to add support for it \u0026 I am not sure if that is an efficient way for adoption of an AA wallet.",

If I understand correctly, EIP 4337 proposes new RPC methods and does not replace the existing ones - `eth_sendTransaction` and `eth_sendUserOperation` also differ in the parameters. dApps should probably anyway update the frontend logic to support AA since now you can bundle multiple transactions and do not have to wait for the previous one to finish.",

        "content": "If we want AA based wallet to become a 1st citizen wallet, then you cannot send transaction using `eth_sendTransaction`. Because when you do a `eth_sendTransaction` the `from` address is your EOA and not your AA wallet. That means when a Dapp calls `eth_sendTransaction` they require funds in the EOA.\n\nThis will lead to confusion because the funds will be AA wallet and not EOA. EOA should just be used to sign \u0026 authorise transactions from AA Wallet.\n\nWe want the user to only have a single wallet not two wallets. Hence for those reasons it will better to have  `eth_sendTransaction` from a AA wallet should internally do a `eth_sendUserOperation` \n\nYou can checkout how this is being done in the `@account-abstraction/sdk` at https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/ERC4337EthersSigner.ts#L27",
