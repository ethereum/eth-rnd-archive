The single threaded version is in https://github.com/potuz/mammon  I want to benchmark a multithreaded version and it seems that I am getting quite an improvement (I understand that this may be useless but still I'm kind of obsessive). I am a little conncerned that my implementation might just be too horrible: hashing a complete mainnet state from today takes 430 miliseconds. Could you benchmark with your rust implementation please? (when you've done the merkleization part). I'd like to know how off-base I am.",
