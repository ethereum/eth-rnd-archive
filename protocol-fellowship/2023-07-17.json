I would assume summing the total of every account would be an impossible task and would thrash the disk IO. So I'm thinking a running total calculated after each block would be better. It would need to be kept in the database so it can survive restarts. IDK exactly how the database works, can I put arbitrary keys there? The initial value would need to be calculated somehow and this could be a challenge without said disk thrashing. It could be calculated with a resync, but that doesn't sound very friendly to the node operators. Has someone done anything like this? Or any ideas that can send me down the right path?",
