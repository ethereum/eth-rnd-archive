My personal preference would be either go or rust as they're both performant and I know them relatively well.\n\nA lot of the work will be honing in a spec though, which should be done using OpenAPI. Ideally it will look and feel somewhat similar to the beacon REST api. It might be best if you try to spec out a couple different methods and then ping me to review so we can talk more about the design and make sure we're on the same page",

I have spent quite a good amount of time in the last few days reading about both of them from various articles and ethresearch posts to gain context and clarity over the topics. \n\n1. eBPS Design and Prototyping - As the broad description of the task involves a lot of things (starting from reviewing the literature to implementing in Prysm), it would be great if someone from the Prysm team (or any consensus research/client team or RIG team) could help me with some next steps. \n\n2. Single slot finality - I believe that this project is quite research heavy as of now and also has some dependencies (like validator economics and aggregation protocols like horn). Hence, I am not sure what would be an ideal expectation from such project as it can be to continue the research, or build PoC for some consensus client or something else. It would be great if someone from the consensus research/client team can guide me on it. \n\nThanks!",
