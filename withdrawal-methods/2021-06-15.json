This is a bit contradictory because it allows pool nodes operators to have full rewards which will help concentrate their power with leveraged stake. \n\nIf you share the MEV rewards then you give the node operator only their share of rewards while also providing additional rewards to pool participants which helps them increase their ETH to have the option of becoming a solo staker.",
