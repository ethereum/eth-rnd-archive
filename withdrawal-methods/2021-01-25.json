To me, trustless staking is enabled as soon as  smart contracts can be set as the withdrawal address -- I consider \u003c@!291925846556540928\u003e's proposal to enable \"trustless\" staking since no one  needs to custody the withdrawal key (this is what pools like RocketPool are waiting for). \n\nI think you have a higher standard of \"trustless\" than this, right? Your proposal goes further in that it is concerned with distributing the validator keys themselves, right?",
