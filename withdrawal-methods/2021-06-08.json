Simplicity: minimize complexity, even at the cost of some losses in efficiency\n\n    0x02 proposal removes a hidden/underivable feature (that the “withdrawal” address isn’t always *the* withdrawal address). Sure, side-channels will still exist, but a complexity is still reduced.\n\n2. Resilience: remain live through major network partitions and when very large portions of nodes go offline\n\n    0x02 or adding the functionality to 0x01 doesn’t violate this\n\n3. Longevity: select all components such that they are either quantum secure or can be easily swapped out for quantum secure counterparts when available\n\n    0x02 or adding the functionality to 0x01 doesn’t violate this\n\n4. Security: utilize crypto and design techniques that allow for a large participation of validators in total and per unit time\n\n    This type of security might be provided by the security one gets with less avenues to hijack their coinbase payments without them knowing\n\n5. Decentralization: allow for a typical consumer laptop with O(C) resources to process/validate O(1) shards (including any system level validation such as the beacon chain)\n\n    0x02 promotes more decentralized validators (maybe this is opinion) or at least discourages low eth stakers from going for the easy centralized route that also offers higher returns",
