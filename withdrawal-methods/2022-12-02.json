This would likely require some form of proof that a given amount of ETH was transferred to the contract from a given validator, and if the amount of ETH was very small then the gas to prove the transfer could eat up a fair chunk of the rewards.\n\nThere are alternatives, such as having a separate contract for each validator, but that burns a chunk of gas in creating them as well as losing out on some more interesting options for contracts with pooling and the like.",
