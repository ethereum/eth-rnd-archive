As long as we use the constraint I suggested ( https://ethresear.ch/t/dirt-simple-withdrawal-contract/8218/9?u=technocrypto ) of having the DSWC be the sending address for the funds, the timing is already controlled by the exit process so there is no inherent security requirement for anything else.  Of course there are lots of possible designs that could *use* something else, but they could wait for the full metadata version.",

Or is there a reason that wouldn't work that I'm missing?",
