        "content": "\u003c@539495253418180618\u003e I came here to post precisely the opposite view to you for the same arguments. The proposed change is simpler than the current implementation. We need to implement a sweep anyway for partial withrawals. So putting all withdrawals in the same footing has less cognitive cost and is simpler to reason both at the spec and production level. Having said so, I would favor any decision on this, be it implementing it or not, rather than delaying. I'm about to implement this in prysm tonight since I got the feeling that we had a slight majority leaning towards implementing it. But now I'm not sure",
