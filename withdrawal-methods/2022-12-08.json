Once your validator has exited you no longer have attestation duties, but still have to wait 27 hours before your 32 ETH becomes withdrawable.\n\nIf you have 0x01 withdrawal credentials (an address), the withdrawal will happen automatically when it's your turn in the (partial _and_ full) withdrawal processing loop, this can take a few days. If you have 0x00 withdrawal credentials (a hash of a BLS withdrawal pubkey), you will be skipped over, and your balance stays as-is.",
