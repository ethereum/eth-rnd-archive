        "content": "I want to run this here which seems more appropriate than the ethstaker's discord. The proposal is for excess transfers and it seems to me that's with small changes to the spec.  Add a `earnings-recipient` to the `Validator` class. It consists of a validator index which by defaults initializes to the owner's index. Then either in calls to `increase_balance` (or in this function itself and change the name) pass `earnings-recipient` instead of the proposer/attester index. A validator would be allowed to change its `earnings-recipient` by sending a message signed with its withdrawal key. Pools can set up validators and accept deposits from small stakers this way, and no need to involve any eth1 address at this stage",
