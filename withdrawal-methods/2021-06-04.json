Please continue to contribute to the discussion - having multiple perspectives can only strengthen the ultimate solution.\n\nTo reiterate the problem we have encountered: decentralised staking pools (such as Rocket Pool) that promote independent node operators are unfairly disadvantaged compared to centralised pools (which control their own nodes).\nAs isidorosp said in the PR comments:\n\"the concern around network/ecosystem health from any possible increased incentives for side-channeling payments for block production should be weighed against the concern of a non-decentralized staking landscape, and the latter is more important, especially when considering the ethos of Ethereum in general.\"\n\nFor evidence on why this latter point is compelling: \nhttps://twitter.com/sparkpool_eth/status/1395662646951641090\n\nWe feel this is an important issue to be addressed for a variety of reasons, but we are supportive of the eth2 implementors' efforts to minimise scope creep to ensure delivery. *If* the solution was refined and agreed we would not require it to be part of the merge. Similar to 0x01 we would be fine with a promise. We would assume that when withdrawals are implemented (approx next hard fork after merge) it would be an opportune time for 0x02 to be implemented.\n\nMany thanks again and we look forward to discussing the proposal further.\n\u003c@!301186049323958275\u003e \u003c@!425572898787426305\u003e \u003c@!291925846556540928\u003e \u003c@!755590043632140352\u003e \u003c@!219015859182632960\u003e \u003c@!273808422753796097\u003e",

Then I'd argue that solo staking is just for the altruistic person that wants to help the network. Thinking on the interests of that solo staker: he is currently presented with two options, either forfeit MEV earnings that may be a relevant part of rewards, or move to a centralized pool. I'm afraid that the lack of this solution or a similar one will cause solo stakers to move to a centralized pool instead of a decentralized one which is the lesser of two evils.",

And so value for the out-of-band transactions would drop, more transactions would move in-band, and the pendulum swings.\n\nIt's definitely a dynamic system, and I don't think that out of band transactions will go away, but I also don't think that in band transactions will go away and so I continue to see benefits for the `0x02` credentials.

This will certainly happen as it benefits both parties.",

And the network statistics such as client diversity, uptime, history, etc are transparent for inspection. To your point earlier, DAO staking indeed does help Ethereum from an economic security standpoint. without decentralized pools, DEXes and other DAOs are forced to pay Coinbase and Binance for security while CEXes use MEV to extract value from DEX customers and 1559 burns the gas that DEX customers spend. It's a really messed up mechanic that doesn't encourage and enable DEXes to stake especially given the fact that DAOs / DEXes have the highest interest in maintaining the security of the network. At least with competition among dpools, DAOs will be able to choose how to allocate their capital and by accruing governance tokens over the pools, influence the development of decentralized pooling protocols",
