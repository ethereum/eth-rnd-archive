        "content": "Question re partial withdrawals. I saw a proposal to automatically partial withdraw every N epochs, and a concern that this might get a little too concentrated. Has there been discussion of making it automatic every N epochs, using the validator index mod N to spread it out? Something like \"partial withdrawal check happens in every epoch X for all validators where validator index mod N equals X mod N\". N could be 20,000 - roughly once a quarter - or 32,768, because it's a power-of number and those are generally liked.",
