        "content": "Hey! Thank you for the reply Danny. We have spent a considerable amount of time analysing the options and we concur with your concerns.\n\nWe still feel that the 0x02 credential would be beneficial and we would use it, if implemented, but we understand that it would add complexity to consensus without fully solving the problem. We have explored our options and we believe we have a crypto-economic mechanism that gives us the same protection as 0x02 and we are in collaboration with Flashbots to be part of the MEV solution. Many thanks, all the best, and hope to catch up soon.",
