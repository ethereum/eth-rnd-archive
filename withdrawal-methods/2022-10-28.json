What would be the problem of only keeping in the state the `state.next_withdrawal_index` and a proposer will put withdrawals up to `MAX_WITHDRAWALS_PER_PAYLOAD`  starting from that index, including both full or partial withdrawals. When we process block operations we can deterministically check that these correspond to our view of the state and validate the block correctly if these withdrawals correspond to our validator set",
