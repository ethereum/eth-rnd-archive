Please work on a solution 🙏",

Also my host knows I was conned because the conman then tried to pretend to be me to withdraw the funds and they knew straight away it wasnt me because they knew I would never have asked the questions the bad actor asked, they sent me screen shots of the conversation, the conman tried to con us both at the same time. Please ETH Devs, think this out more, while I am concerned of course for my finances, imagine some entity wants ETH 2.0 to fail, are you fully prepared for that. Please watch Cyber Polygon 2021, they warn that all IT systems may be breached. ALL, its no joke they are seriously concerned!",

So it goes like this at withdrawal: 1) You initiate withdrawal 2) The withdrawal process waits x number of blocks to ensure there are no additional conflicting withdrawal requests to different addresses 3) At the end of the period if there is only one requested withdrawal address the validator is exited and funds transferred. If not the validator continues and keys are locked until a court makes a decision. The interesting bit is we build a smart contract for legal purposes and that is the only way to unlock the keys. The only difficulty then becomes defining who \"the courts\" are. But if that challenge could be overcome then the problem is mostly solved. I mean, what are the chances your attacker would even show up in court?",

        "content": "Dear emptymind, I am grateful that you are considering ways around this situation, this is my point, if a key was breached or stolen, the bad actor could not prove it was theirs in court, \u0026 as you say more than likely would NOT show up in court becuase they would probably go to jail once the judge realised the person was a thief, but why can EF not create an option A: where the the server side key \u0026 withdrawal key can be used together to initiate an option to block external withdrawals \u0026 make withdrawals possible only from the server side . Lee Sutton explained to me before this could create an issue with the host, but if this can only be activated with both keys, whats the issue? If the host is having difficulty identifying the rightful owner then phase B: is initiated where the node stays locked until the rightful owner is identified, this achieves multiple things, 1: gives the host and key holder a chance to work together or resolve the issue in court, 2 it gives the rightful owner a chance to get legal ownership of the node back, 3 locking the node means the network doesnt have a withdrawal making the network stronger and doesnt burn the ETH which is a bad idea anyway sorry, 4 it mitigates any resentment from investors who get robbed who most likely will initiate court cases because we could be talking serious sums of money at the point of withdrawal, \u0026 lastly 5 it protects the reputation of EF. To me it is unthinkable that EF would turn a blind eye to fraud within the POS network, especially to investors that basically helped launch POS. I truly do get the ethos behind decentralisation but there has to be logic which protects users, otherwise the system is flawed. Has anyone wondered if people would like a way to register their key ownership? if a second person tried to register the key, straight away, the user could go to step A or if the host is not willing to help, go straight to step B and lock the node? I am very grateful for all your efforts ETH Devs 😘",

Its a silly comparison but you get my point.\n\nI think its great that the problem is being discussed, there is quite a bit of time to find a solution, and the space may change quite a lot by the time withdrawals are allowed. I am grateful for everyones times, I really am, even those who are being gently firm, the reality is I F'ed up, the scam was a good one because I am not that dumb, but sadly feel I am probably the stupidest on this discord chnnel hence my comment above about feeling unworthy to post here.\n\nI bid you all a nice day and thank you for considering to ponder the situation. ❤️",

I have just sent an email to the CEO of my host, I would like to ask to what extent they have breached keys, how common or rare it is, the other problem is some may not know the keys have been breached, I dont quite understand how the CLI setup works, but does it create a log on the computer with sensitive infrmation that can be hacked?\n\nI know I am a nobody, but in my tiny brain, I still think a way for a key holder to work with the host, where the withdrawal key holder authorises the host to block external withdrawals and then the two parties can work together stress free to either withdraw and setup a new node, or just leave the node running if there is no fear for an external threat is the best option. If I had to, I would travel to California from Europe so we both input the keys at the same time to inistiate the withdrawal, this option does not have to affect any users, only those who are uncertain if their key were breached or sure they were, it gives the key holders a chance to resolve a breach, learn from their mistakes, and with luck, continue to be part of this exciting project protecting the Ethereum base layer, the more the ETH increases in value the harder it will be for people like me to be involved in securing the network, so for a decentralised point of view, protecting the little guys does makes sense.\n\nIf my host tried to screw or blackmail me I would sue them, I just cannot see that ever happeing, my host for example has $2B value of nodes, I am sure they would never consider hurting their customers or reputation, my understanding is they are prepared to go to great lengths to protect us.\n\nSorry to put my awe in again, over and out.",
