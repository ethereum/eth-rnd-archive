There are a few moving pieces in the life cycle of a pool, from creation to operation, to rewards/ penalties, to liquidation and anything in between. \nIf one part is highly centralised it can compromise the entire network. For example, if you tokenise the stake and have a contract which manages that but that contract is controlled by a centralised entity than a big part of that network is centralised.\nAnother example will be enforcing network actions on individual pools like liquidation.",
