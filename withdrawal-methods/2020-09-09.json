        "content": "Having a \"system withdrawal contract\" at a fixed address to call to perform eth1 withdrawals (and to receive withdrawn funds from) sounds like it would solve a lot of problems. And makes a lot of sense given the symmetry with the VRC.\n\nWould it make sense / be possible for validator balances to be pushed to the system withdrawal contract while updating some mapping of `withdrawalAddress =\u003e balance`? This way, we could design contracts which simply pull their allocated balance within the scope of a single transaction (and the caller would pay all their own gas costs). All we need to know ahead of time is:\n- The address of the system withdrawal contract\n- The method signature of its \"withdraw\" method\n\nRe: not knowing which validator funds are coming from - could we maybe specify an interface which validator contracts must implement, which gives them this information? Something like `function receiveValidatorBalance(bytes memory _pubkey) external payable`",

        "content": ".\nEven if a system in which withdrawals are performed atomically isn't possible, it would still be nice to have the funds come from a known, fixed address. This way, we can implement a `payable` method which reverts if `msg.sender != ETH2_WITHDRAWAL_ADDRESS`. Then we have confidence that funds are actually coming from a withdrawn validator and not from some malicious actor trying to trigger our withdrawal logic with an incorrect balance.",
