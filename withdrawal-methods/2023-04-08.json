Is there any chance that in future, devs will considers this and adjust the process for validator exit and funds withdrawal. i have the validator keys and  and passwords, but cant find the mnemonics. After 2.5 years of contributing to the blockchain, I got stuck with this. There many others like me. Would it be possible to send the funds to another address in the consensus layer after exiting validator duties. From there, with the new address and known mnemonics, the bls can be changed. I know it sounds stupid. Sorry for that. I am not a dev, just an excited ethereum fan who locked his funds 2.5 years ago. 😦",
