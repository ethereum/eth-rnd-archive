The idea is to allow the stakers to import this JSON file to the `SignedBLSToExecutionChange` pool of their beacon node (BN) with BN commands.\n\nWe are seeking client teams' feedback on the process and data schema design 🙏\n\nDiscussion thread is here: https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/issues/312\n\n/cc \u003c@755590043632140352\u003e",
