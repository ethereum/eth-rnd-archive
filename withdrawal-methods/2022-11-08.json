Just wanted to clarify that adding the extra % and the semantics of the loop variable to be latest_validator_index, will still withdraw validator 1 first. The only way to start the fork at validator 0 would be to change also `upgrade_to_capella` and this is my objection that I wouldn't want to do that",
