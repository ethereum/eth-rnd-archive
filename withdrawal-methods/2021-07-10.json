It may happen at the same time as the merge, I suppose.\n\nThe spec change itself could be pretty minor: a restriction stating that credentials must go from `0x00` to `0x01` would avoid a lot of the DOS vectors, and the operation would be relatively simple (existing credentials' public key, new withdrawal credentials, signature).  Implementation would touch a fair number of areas (new p2p topic, altered beacon block body, transmission and validation, perhaps inclusion fees) so it would have to be considered in terms of priority compared to everything else that is trying to be added.",
