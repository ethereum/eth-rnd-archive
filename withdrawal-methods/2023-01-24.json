        "content": "Consensus Layer Withdrawal Protection (CLWP) is now accepting set withdrawal address submissions [using ethdo, but we we hope to support staking-deposit-cli submissions too] via GitHub. The automated review process can tell you within ~2 minutes if your withdrawal address is valid for mainnet or goerli validators. Once the Capella hard fork happens (no official date, still estimated for March-ish), our community of volunteers will help broadcast to many beacon nodes the CLWP submissions - giving you the fastest and more secure way to set your withdrawal address. Happy to help anyone who needs it. https://github.com/benjaminchodroff/ConsensusLayerWithdrawalProtection/ We greatly appreciate any suggestions, help or volunteers.",
