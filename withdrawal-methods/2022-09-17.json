I download the new cli, usb transfer it to the airgapped, put in mijn pre April2021 mnemonic and my withdrawal address, sign it, put the  signed message on the usb back to the connected computer and publish it. With that my pre April21 validator with a 0x00 address becomes a 0x01 address and I can then partiality withdraw to the withdrawal address?",
