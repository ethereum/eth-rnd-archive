I'm not sure if it's the best solution (we could perhaps process withrawals in the same loop as effective balances) but adding a validator registry size loop is not something we're happy about. It'd be nice if we could get some indication that a change like this would be accepted cause we're already implementing state transition. CC \u003c@680234424037670912\u003e",
