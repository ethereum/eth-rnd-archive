Of course, the deposit contract would need to be redeployed to support that, but I found the withdrawal method = \"the creation of ETH out of thin air with no connection to the deposit process\" somewhat weird. If people keep hoping in and out, and in and out of staking, the deposit contract will nominally acquire an ever-increasing amount of ETH. I know that the arguments for your proposed method are \"reduced complexity\", but it seems also to create technical debt.",
