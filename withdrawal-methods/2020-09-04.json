I can see some benefits to automatic, such as integrations into defi platforms where a human wouldn't be required to action the process and it \"just happens\" when the node logs out, but generally a pull method is safer and better understood among dapp developers.",

If it's pull then there needs to be some way of ETH1 querying and updating ETH2 state, which seems like a harder problem to me.\n\nThis does, however, assume quite a bit about how ETH1/ETH2 interactions could occur.  I'm not particularly pushing for one method over another, but if one has simplicity (and hence time to deployment) benefits it probably makes sense to move in that direction.",
