Changing your keys sometimes might be good for security reasons. It's fine if you can only do it while proposing a block, I guess it shouldn't be extremely hard or expensive, it does not affect the security properties of consensus.",

        "content": "in theory, its doable but would lead to some consensus complexity -- you can get the same effect by simply exiting as a validator and re-entering the validator set w/ new keys if you need to rotate and this solution skips having to bring the rotation logic in-protocol",
