        "content": "\u003c@539495253418180618\u003e I have a quick question about withdrawals in newPayload. In engine spec we have:\n\"- `withdrawals`: `Array of WithdrawalV1` - Array of withdrawals, each object is an `OBJECT` containing the fields of a `WithdrawalV1` structure.\" https://github.com/ralexstokes/execution-apis/blob/add-withdrawal-operations/src/engine/specification.md#executionpayloadv2\n\nHowever, in EIP-4895 we have:\n\"The execution payload gains a new field for the withdrawals which is an RLP list of Withdrawal data.\"\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895#new-field-in-the-execution-payload-withdrawals\n\nShould EL expect objects or rlp enoded array (like transactions)? I assume objects, but we want to be 100% sure 🙂 \ncc: \u003c@912415191067676693\u003e \u003c@792822129019584562\u003e",
