This EIP facilitates proof of consensus. That is, a zk rollup proving that decentralized sequencer nodes came to consensus on the order of blocks. At present, this EIP focuses on consensus protocols that rely on a threshold number of signers signing a block header (think QBFT and PoS on top of QBFT). I haven’t thought through how this would need to change to prove other consensus protocols that might be used by decentralized sequencer blockchains. Feedback would be appreciated.",
