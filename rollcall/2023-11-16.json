We'd love to get your feedback and collaborate on this proposal.\n\nIt's one of 3 RIPs - the AA transaction, the aggregation transaction (still WiP), and the mempool validation rules (identical to 4337).\n\nLooking forward to your feedback in the discussions thread and in the PR. Also happy to discuss it in person if you're at DCxPrague.",
