Hoping to expand the audience beyond the based sequencing calls.\n\nWe have a lot of time (1.5h) so I hope to cover significant technical ground and answer questions rollup team members may have :) (re @kalmanlajko: Will the topics of this call be similar to the \"Shared sequencing and preconfirmations\" calls? Or because it is a rollcall, maybe it will be more rollup focused?)",
