IIRC, there are 15 reputable people (all of whom are doxxed) on zkSync's multi-sig, and you need at least 8 of them to sign for the longest timelock. \n\nObviously, this is a very imperfect solution, but I personally prefer it to having a completely centralized upgradability. Of course, I'd like to see immutable contracts, and they'll get there, but this is an understandable intermediate step.",
