        "content": "I am assuming security levels are different since there are significant differences in designs (and use/liquidity/degree of decentralization).  But I think that's a step we should worry about when we are capable of connecting the two mechanically. And it's not much related to the standards as the latter concerns with just categorizing and abstracting different L2 layers for the purpose of building adaptors.  For example right now, BTC can go over a bridge and land on Ethereum but security levels of the two networks are not supposed to be equal.  But Ia m sure Ren has made models of BTC and Eth networks first (standard), then has tried to connect them together (adaptor).",
