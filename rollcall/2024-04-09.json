For G1 not a problem, endomorphism acceleration is even not needed beyond 2^10 sized MSM, the overhead is too large. This is the pragmatic approach. (no change to EIP)\n2. enforce subgroup check. This is the misuse resistance approach\n3. provide subgroup check, and clear cofactor separate primitives, so people can do it themselves, this is the performance and modularity approach, (re @ralexstokes: PTAL: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-2537-bls12-precompile-discussion-thread/4187/65?u=ralexstokes\n\nim not sure ill be able to join the call tomorrow but we should get these questions sorted)",
