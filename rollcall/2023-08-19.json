        "content": "No risk there. The centralised exchange verifies that they have received the funds on L2 before paying them out on L1 - this can be done quickly and securely because the exchange is running an L2 node which validates the transaction (and all L2 blocks). The downside is you have to completely trust the exchange because they may take your L2 funds and not pay out on L1. \n\nFor a decentralised bridge, it’s L1 that has to verify the tx was sent on L2 and it can’t verify every block and transaction on the L2 so you need some other mechanism like fault proofs or ZK proofs to allow it to verify the L2 tx was sent.",
