We've seen these gas prices in the last couple of months when speculative activity subsides. Curiously, the 7D MA gas price bottomed out at around 20 gwei and is on the rise again. \n\nThere could be short periods where we fall below this target, but in the long term there'll very likely be higher demand induced by low fees, as Micah says above. We'll see new usecases and applications emerge on rollups that weren't possible on L1.",
