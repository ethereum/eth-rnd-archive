Optimistic rollups have bigger and/or more blocks than L1\n3. For each L2 transaction, the sequencer posts compressed transaction data on L1\n4. Doesn't this already consume more space on average than L1 transactions? Even for 12-14 bytes/L2-tx, most L1 tx don't allocate new state (or that state is short lived, e.g. acquiring a token before getting rid of it).\n5. In order to complete a fraud proof against the rollup, validators (those expected to submit fraud proofs) need to keep the L2 state\n6. Because there are more TX/s on L2, this state can in theory grow larger than L1 state fairly quickly, and keep growing, making it hard to validate optimistic rollups with commodity hardware.\n\nWhat am I missing here? From the above it feels like rollups only solve the scalability issue but only insofar that we have the following properties:\n\nA. We can have more tx/s on L2.\nB. Optimistic rollups inherit the finality properties of L1 (once the fraud proof delay is passed)\nC. L1 stays easy to validate with commodity hardware.\nD. L2 is hard to validate with commodity hardware.\n\nThat does feel like a hybrid model where L1 transaction are very secure and L2 are secure as long as the sequencer is trustworthy and/or there are trustworthy validators, but it's hard for plain Joe to check that (essentially the it's the Solana/Polygon/BSC model + \"more decentralized\" ETH-L1 finality guarantees).\n\nI guess it's better to have the choice, but that's not how these rollups are sold/presented. Unless (hopefully) I'm missing something?",
