L2s can have additional fees too. Happy to chat in more detail.

        "content": "\u003carikgal\u003e Thanks - reached out to discuss further - understanding it's probably a future looking discussion.\nLooking at today's situation - an L2 might be \"EVM compatible\" and have pre-london gas calculation or separate fees for Execution/Data and this is one of the places where divergence of implementations is one of the most diverse in EVM compatible chains (as far as I see them). So some level of agreed upon categorization here might be interesting/useful.\n\nI'm assuming CommonCore would calculate the basic post-london fork way, right?",
