Should certainly have backup committees (or even a backup consensus mechanism) in case Solana fails, but why should a validium not leverage this? You could probably do Solana-like throughput while being more secure than Solana native smart contracts given state root transitions proved to Ethereum. Building in forward compatibility to Ethereum data shards as a bonus. Of course, we have to get to ZK rollups first and saturate that.\n\nCelestia is also pretty interesting, definitely paying attention to a new breed of L1s that are focused on data availability",
