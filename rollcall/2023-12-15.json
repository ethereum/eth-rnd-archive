Don't know where I got the idea that mempool clients would only forward txs for known paymasters.\n\nIt's permissionless but I can see where the confusion could come from.  Paymaster rules are more nuanced:\n- If the paymaster doesn't need to access its own storage (only the account's), then it is accepted (and the UserOp is propagated). It has no way to DoS the mempool so it's equivalent to an account.\n- If the paymaster does access its own storage, it could DoS the mempool by changing its behavior when used multiple times in the same bundle.  So it is only accepted and propagated if it locked a stake.  The stake serves as a sybil resistance mechanism, allowing nodes to keep a reputation and throttle paymasters that cause mass invalidations.\n- A group of nodes may choose to form their own alt mempool where they waive this requirement and choose to trust a certain paymaster after auditing it. But this can't be done in the canonical mempool because the protocol is not opinionated about any specific paymaster.\n\nI guess the confusion came from some people talking about the 3rd case.\n\n\u003e Either or.
