But to get back to your original censorship question, it seems to me like if you can force the chain to advance you can force it to make the L2 state root commitment on L1, which would then let you make the L2\u003c-\u003eL2 message.",

        "content": "Yes, so what I'm looking for is if the receiving L2 sequencer set censors (which might be the case for small L2s), then you can force it through L1, but that will be expensive. And I think that via a DA layer, you can force the rollup to look for txs on the DA layer, and receive them. This is what Celestia does to some extent.",
