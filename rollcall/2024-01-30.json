It was previously suggested in this channel to do the following:\n\nCreate a PR in the RIPs repo\nDiscuss with rollup teams to see who would consider implementing (directly or via Eth Magicians?)\nPresent on RollCall\n\nIs this still the process/order you would recommend? Should we post in Ethereum Magicians first?",
