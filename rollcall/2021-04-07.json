There are many L2 implementations and deployed systems but they generally can't talk to each other.\nI imagine solutions such as starkware are effectively standards.  Are there more examples?\nThen we'll need adaptors for inter-standard interoperability.  Adaptors exist such as connext.  But the work of adaptors will get harder and harder absent standard L2 implementations.  There should be standards for each type of L2 (e.g. stark, optimistic, etc), and then adaptors for each pairs of them.",
