(re @adietrichs: As discussed, the breakout call this week will be on L2 fee markets! this one will be a bit more experimental, as this is more of a research topic - we will have to see to what extent a breakout call is a good format for making progress on this.\n\nYou can find the announcement \u0026 agenda here: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rollcall-breakout-2-fee-markets/18381\n\nAs usual, zoom link will be shared here shortly before the call. Looking forward to seeing (some of) you on the call!)",
