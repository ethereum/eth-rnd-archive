As far as I understand it, you can either trust the rollup's sequencer or wait for the batch to make it on chain. Once that happens, it's pretty secure against double spends and other reordering/cancellation attacks.\n\nFor an ORU, to be 100% sure, you still have to verify yourself or wait for the fraud period to elapse. Most of the time, you won't actually need that level of security though.\n\nI'm less familiar with zk-rollups, but as far as I understand it, generating the zk-proof can take some time, so you probably want to wait for that?",
