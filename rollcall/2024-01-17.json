Following up on the working group calls announced on last week's RollCall (sorry for not doing so sooner!): It took a while to sort out the details, so we decided to postpone the first topic (\"Precompile RIP explorations\") to the end of the call series. With that, the confirmed schedule will be:\n\nJan 17 (today): No call\nJan 24: EIP-4844 readiness check\nJan 31: Fee Markets for L2 EVMs\nFeb 07: Precompile RIP explorations\nFeb 14: RollCall #3\n\nAlways same time slots as the usual RollCall. I will post an agenda and zoom links before each call. Sorry again for the late announcement of today's postponement, and see you next week for the EIP-4844 readiness check!",
