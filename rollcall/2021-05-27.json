I know that I am oversimpliyfing it. \n\nthanks for the answer Micah, awesome bowtie 😅",

There are gene therapies available today that you can get to increase your fitness (evolutionary use of the term), but they are quite expensive.

Also with eye care, I could get LASIK today to fix my decaying vision, but I know that we are a short number of years away from far more advanced rejuvenation techniques (already tested in animal models).",
