(re @eliastzr: Is there a chat for rollup core devs to talk about their common hardships?\n\nExample: integrating https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flood into a rollup’s integration test suite and running into issues such as mentioned in https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flood/issues/57 (running flood on non-L1 envs)\n\nI think it could be really nice I don’t know if it exists yet.\n\nOther examples where it can be super useful:\n- challenges on some edge cases on L1 data formats (fee market \u0026 base fee, block hash computation choices, etc.)\n- ethereum foundation tests choices and tradeoffs)",
