But we can't force bundlers to do so, and thus can't force them to share the saved cost. (re @kristofgazso: instead of deciding globally how big to make these privilidged ids and all we could make it so there is just a standard interface for decompressors (a one function interface in all likelyhood) and they are deployed to different addresses. then its actually the bundler who maintains their own proxy contract that they send ops through, where the bundler themselves decides how to store the decompressor contracts in storage)",
