If the attack transaction does a DELEGATECALL from a proxy to the attack contract, to call the victim contract, then the msg.sender observed by the victim contract is the proxy contract (and not the actual malicious attack contract). The call stack breaks this evasion by exposing the DELEGATECALLed addresses in the call stack.\n\nFor instance, this defense can be circuimvented by having a single tx where there is firstly a contract deployed and then called. This could be done through private mempool not giving enough time for anyone to react. Even if it is done on an L2 (which at this moment dont usually have private mempool), the first-come-first-serve which employed by most of the rollups today would still let this transaction into mempool faster than any off-chain service for malicious contract detection could blacklist the sender (re @Andrew_Beal: Hi RollCall Community - Just a reminder that OpenZeppelin/Forta will be presenting RIP-7614 on tomorrow's RollCall #3.
