I’m working on Unstoppable Rollups under an EF grant and our first Community Call unfortunately conflicted with Rollcall!\n\nI would love the opportunity to give my presentation to the Rollcallers who missed it. The topic is “The Religion of Stage 2”—an argument that the viewpoint that Stage 2 rollups meaningfully secure user assets cannot be rationally defended.\n\nHere is the video but I’d love to do something live to enable Q\u0026A and debate! Thanks!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DdFrUo1T5A",
