In particular L2 tx statuses and their drfinitions. \n\nMeeting zoom link is here:\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/81599021689?pwd=VmxPVUNCVmE5RkkweGY1YmN1OWMrZz09 (re @eliastzr: I think wallets and block explorers should be able to convey similar levels of heuristics about a tx status (though block explorers display a lot more info)\n\nEvery rollup has on their block explorer some notion of soft finality vs. strong finality \n\nMaybe we could unite into an RIP and name those 3 to 4 states a tx goes through so wallets accurately help users navigate this security space (could simply end up being the color of the ✅)\nSame for etherjs and similar tools that rely on logic such as block mining to confirm a tx \n(this also paves the way for supporting preconfs on L1))",
