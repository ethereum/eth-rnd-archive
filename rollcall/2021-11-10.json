We should avoid discussing (on the bad meaning) about that, because any terms that becomes popular will star being used by marketmen. As being a decentralized community it's tough to have someone take the authority to set what technologies should or shouldn't use a term.",

But all these sorts of solutions may be bypassed by the same user using hundreds of different accounts to fake as hundreds of different users. Then we'd need to throw privacy away to be able to identify when the same user is using multiple accounts.",
