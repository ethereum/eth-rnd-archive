Still a complete n00b so highly appreciate if someone could point me to the right resources.\n\nI assume fraud means some invalid transaction (e.g. a hacker spoof a tx to double spend my USDC elsewhere on L2). \n\nIf there is no fraud, no one really need fraud proof.. If there is indeed a fraud, it takes up to 7 days to be detected. When the fraud is detected, what's going to happen? Revert L2 to pre-fraud block? But that seems both unlikely and ineffective. There are many other transactions unrelated to the fraud committed after the fraud tx that would have to be reverted. Even if everyone is ok to revert everything, the money is likely already gone - withdrawal to an CEX onramp or swapped away to another L1 via liquidity bridge.. Yes it didn't get committed to L1 Mainnet but that seems no longer useful.. Anyway, I'm quite puzzled.",
