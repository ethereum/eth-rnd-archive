Sharding on the current roadmap is purely for data availability (what was previously Phase 1) - these data shards will be used to accelerate rollups, you won't be able to do any transactions on them. My speculation is that we'll never see the old fraud-proven execution sharding model (what was previously Phase 2), and instead head straight to zkEVM on L1 in a few years' time.",
