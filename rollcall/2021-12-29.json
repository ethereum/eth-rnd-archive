Some questions I have so far:\n\n1. Where exactly does EVM execution happen after sharding is introduced? Looking here https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/sharding_proposal it seems that a shard block is just a data blob.\n2. It's probably dependent on my previous question, but what shard information do I have available when executing txs. IIUC the beacon block has the headers of all shard blocks, but I'm not sure what this means for execution\n3. Assuming 2 is approximately true, would I have access to all historical shard headers?",
