(basically each bridge transfer for end up as a `withdrawal` after being validated by the CL).\n\nAnyways sounds like I need to look at the OP stack, I didn't realize it uses the engine API, and this is the 2nd time in 24h someone has directed me towards that diff link. :). Thanks for the pointer!",

        "content": "Yeah withdrawals would provide the ability to mint so maybe there could be some simplification from that. The other part of deposits is that they can be a full tx (call contracts etc) which is important for censorship resistance and the gas for them is paid on L1. Might still be workable to have a withdrawal for just the right amount and a normal tx included in the block. \nThere are some other details that require modifications currently (like the CL being able to force inclusion of transactions).",

But I doubt we’d ever get to using a completely standard execution client just because it wouldn’t be a priority for L1 dev.",
