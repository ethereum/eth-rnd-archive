(re @ethrnd_rollcall_bot: \u003cajsutton\u003e [reply]: It's way more efficient to submit as much data in a single tx as possible, so 6 blobs is the cheapest option if it gets included on chain reliably/fast enough.  If nothing else, for each transaction you pay 21k gas which is amortised over the number of blobs in each tx.)",
