But quick answer: Canyon has been deployed to all testnets and governance approved, Delta is a small follow-up upgrade with batch efficiency improvements that was activated on devnets, but will still need public testnet work and a new governance vote. And for 4844 there is a draft in the monorepo, this may be going into Eclipse, the next upgrade after. We’re aiming to develop more iterative small upgrade proposals. Can’t comment on timelines.",
