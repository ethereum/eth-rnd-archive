It's a rough model, but my process thus far is:\n- Linear regression on Ethereum gas fee revenue to predict 2023 annual revenue\n- Assume 80% of transactions occur on rollups, and that all rollups utilise DA services (is this reasonable?)\n- The bit I'm struggling with is estimating what % of of this 80% of gas will be spent on DA services, any suggestions on how I could make this an educated estimate?? \n\nTy!",
