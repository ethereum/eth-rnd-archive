Optimism, Matter Labs and Offchain Labs have clearly announced that they intend to scale past L1 over time. Whether this is a good idea or not - and I'm well aware of your opinion on the matter - is a different matter, but we *will* see rollups scale past L1's ~1.1M gas/second limit. \n\nI'm intrigued to see Fuel's approach with UTXOs, though!",
