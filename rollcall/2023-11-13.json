Bandersnatch is chosen to be \"zkfriendly\" with the BLS12-381 proof system, but there's no \"zkevm\" project using this curve because of the missing pairing precompile, and many proof systems are moving towards small FRI field, which is not compatible with bandersnatch/wagon, so its a fun topic to discuss. Happy to meet anyone who wants to talk about this in-person during DevConnect",
