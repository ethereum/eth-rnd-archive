You might know that Optimism recently paid the largest bug bounty in history (2M$) for an infinite money bug.\n\u003e But if the bug had been exploited, the withdrawal period would have allowed us to rollback the chain to mitigate the damage.\n(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\n(from that thread) This is only a viable strategy if you have a centralized/permissioned system with an intentional delay baked in and the ability to *rewrite history*.  You can build such a system with a zkRollup just fine, *or* you can build an actually permissionless system with a zkRollup.",
