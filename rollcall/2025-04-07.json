I would expect that there will be more clarity over the next ~3 months on topics like the future of the L1 execution system and the relationship with L2s around that.\n\nWe plan to re-assess the situation of RollCall and the RIPs (and common core) effort once that reaches stability, to see how this group can be maximally useful going forward.",
