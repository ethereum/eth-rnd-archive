        "content": "Micah's point is that if fraud is rare the apps _won't_ be generating revenue from fraud proofs, and in fact are likely to lose money supporting the staff and infra to keep the fraud proof checker online, so the checker might be shut down.   Basically the lack of fraud leads to the lack of checkers, which in turn makes the chain a good target for fraud.  Sure, then once there is fraud (presumably found post-fact) checkers will come back online, but only after some fraud has actually occurred, so there will be windows of opportunity to commit fraud periodically.\n\n It's an inherently asymmetric issue as well, as an attacker I can always commit a \"small fraud\" to see if any checkers are online, if they aren't then I can proceed w/ my \"big\" fraud.",
