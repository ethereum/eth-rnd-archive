I've gone through Vitalik's great post (https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html), but I still have questions. \n\nMostly I'm wondering how both ZK and Optimistic rollups work without keeping track of the merkle tree. In both cases the L1 contract does not store the merkle tree which is the state for the rollups, right? So then for ZK do you really just need the root hash, batch, and zk-snark proof to verify that the merkle root provided is correct? Surely you would need the merkle tree? \n\nAnd similarly for Optimistic, I don't understand how the fraud proofs work. You provide the batch, which corresponds to a partial merkle tree (right?), and then you need to provide the hashes for the parts of the merkle tree which you did not provide leaves for right? But if that's all you provide, the contract can't know whether one of those hashes you provided (without the child leaves) is correct. You could just put any random hash there?",
