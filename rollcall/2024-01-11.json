All RIPs are optional by definition, and in many cases one L2 will prioritize a feature and write an RIP for it while other L2s have different priorities and would implement the same one at a later time.  Therefore we don't require it to have two implementations, just to be relevant for more than one L2.

Because we don't want 7 RIPs that propose 7 solutions to the same problem, each implementable in principle by all 7 proposers but in practice no two actually doing it in \"the same way\" (for values of \"same\" that don't mean sharing code, but do mean interoperable.
