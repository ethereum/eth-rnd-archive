But does the rollup also post proofs for all other state that settles on the L2? Like does Optimism need to post proofs for a token like OP, which originated and settles on Optimism?\n\nFrom what I understand, a rollup \"inheriting security\" is mostly the rollup ensuring valid state transitions on the L1 assets on the rollup, and the L1 doesn't necessarily have any concept of the tokens originating on the L2. Please let me know if im incorrect here.",
