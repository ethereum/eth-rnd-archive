We explored the idea of remote participation, but were not happy with any of the proposed solutions. While we appreciate this may be a major disappointment to many of you (I know is it for me), we feel it is unwise to try launch a standards effort when many participants will be unable to attend. \n\n## How we will be proceeding:\n\nWe will be canceling the in-person RollCall #1 - Devconnect Istanbul, but many of the people who planned to attend will still be in Istanbul, so informal meet-ups are highly encouraged. In particular, it'd be great to still have discussions and make progress on some of the specific topics listed above and more generally on how RIPs can be governed and run. We can then formulate these as more concrete written proposals for wider community discussion on EthMagicians, and in upcoming RollCalls. Both myself and @adietrichs will around and would love to chat so please reach out to either of us.",
