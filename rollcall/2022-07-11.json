It has a committee of 20 nodes and a trust assumption of at least 2 of them being honest. Instead of posting full transactions on L1, the committe posts only \"Data Availability Certificates\" (= signing of transaction batch hashes?) and exposes servers to download the data by hash. If less than 19 committees are honest, the chain falls back to a normal rollup. At least 2 of commitee members are supposed to be honest. The chain is meant for gaming and social applications.",
