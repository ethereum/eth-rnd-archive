        "content": "Hi, as a solo staker for the past 28 months, I wanted to add my voice in strong support of EIP-7514 going into Dencun.\n\nBased on previous network tests, it sounds like Ethereum as it stands today cannot handle a validator count much above 1.5m. It also sounds like the failure case when approaching that number manifests as an increasing number of node operators, beginning with the most modestly-resourced nodes, failing to keep up with the head of the chain due to quadratically increasing P2P overhead.\n\nI think validator counts that are permitted to grow per the current churn limit increase schedule may become a dire threat to Ethereum's decentralization or even functioning, by freezing out an increasing number of solo stakers until only those with relatively powerful staking hardware can participate, or in the worst case, until Ethereum itself can't finalize. I personally am running on an only moderately powerful setup, and thus feel threatened by the increasing rate of validator count growth.\n\nI know that the current plan is to improve client performance as the validator set grows, and to \"keep one step ahead\" of that failure case. It's also possible that the current \"only up\" validator growth will peter out and reach more-or-less steady state before we start losing significant numbers of solo stakers whose rigs can't keep up. But I just think it makes a great deal of sense to give developers more breathing room, and to reassure our large base of solo stakers that they will be able to participate well into the future, by getting EIP-7514 into Dencun, not at some undefined later date (or never).\n\nThanks!",
