For others if you need to send a quick blob tx you can use: `go run cmd/blob-sender/main.go -r \u003cRPC node\u003e --random-privkey -b \"random::256\"`.  Obviously w/ a random privkey you're not going to actually send the tx but you can confirm you node returns insufficient gas (in my case I just wanted to double check that our proxy fronting our nodes that accept `eth_sendRawTransaction` was fully handling blob txs).  you can also use `-p \u003cprivkey\u003e` if you have a funded throw-away key you want to use.",
