        "content": "if multiple 32ETH validators are slashed initial slashing penalty will be the same as if those validators were consolidated. There is an increased slashing risk for consolidated validator vs non-consolidation but after some number of keys run by the same node the risk becomes the same, i.e. consolidating up to a certain extent does not lead to an increased slashing risk.
