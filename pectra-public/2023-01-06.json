        "content": "We have launched the fastest and safest way to set withdrawal address on your Ethereum validator using the Consensus Layer Withdrawal Protection community project (CLWP EIP-4736). We will broadcast these messages to many nodes in advance and during the Capella/Shanghai hard fork. Details can be found in these slides https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qV0NP2-5UZI51Ja7Vf_ANOR9AqIPvNpfuTzxbJVCn90/edit?usp=sharing and we are accepting GitHub submissions now at https://github.com/benjaminchodroff/ConsensusLayerWithdrawalProtection   Arbitration using Kleros will be available later this month. I would greatly appreciate any feedback before I record a video demo of the process next week. We encourage every staker who has not set their withdrawal address to use CLWP to set it (or feel free us ask questions if you want help to set it yourself). We greatly appreciate any volunteers who will help load our verifiable community list onto their nodes too.",
