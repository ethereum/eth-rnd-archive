It has basically nothing to do with the execution layer (no changes related to the execution layer at least).  It is all consensus layer changes/APIs and how they communicate the current execution layer state.  Am I missing something?  Is there something that *actually* impacts the execution layer in here?  cc \u003c@!554799849288105986\u003e",
