Once the EL enables the Engine API ... either with announced TTD or possibly earlier, watch Thursday's ACD for that discussion ... you can connect the CL to it. The CL can be checkpoint synced in seconds. You may see ELs ship with a light client CL embedded just for RPC/consensus purposes in future, but for now, any of the five CLs will do just fine and it isn't a ton of effort to set up.",
