The Merge is coming up as the next major network upgrade which will change from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, but that isn't likely to have a direct impact on available blockspace.  There is active research into a number of things that may help reduce demand or increase supply of block space, but none are available in a censorship resistant way yet (Layer 2 solutions are available, but not censorship resistant).",
