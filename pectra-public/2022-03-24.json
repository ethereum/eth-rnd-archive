And checkpoint sync is not enabled by default; to enable it you need an already synced node or Infura? So a new node joining the main net will have to rely on Infura to avoid very slow full syncing? This doesn't sound particularly decentralized to me.",

        "content": "TL;DR Because of the weak subjectivity (an inherent PoS property) one must verify the block root at the weak subjectivity checkpoint when bootstrapping or starting a node after being offline for a while. This verification can be done in many different ways, asking your friend about the root at the checkpoint, double checking with services and block explorers. Ideally, you do several ways to prove the same checkpoint to make this process BFT. Without WS checkpoint verification syncing with the network is insecure in PoS disregarding whether it's a sync from genesis or from a state at the WS checkpoint.\n\nYou also might want to read this https://notes.ethereum.org/Mp5Iv4N0Qb-d6KZvNuBspg",
