Could someone please confirm my understanding that blocks during the merge will be produced like this:\n1. pre-merge we get normal PoW blocks with difficulty != 0 and total difficulty \u003c TTD\n2. at some point we get the last PoW block with difficulty != 0 and total difficulty \u003e= TTD\n3. and finally, all other blocks from here will have difficulty == 0 and total difficulty equal to the last PoW block\n(with difficulty and total difficulty I mean whatever the JSON RPC interface gives me for blocks, I guess technically they don't exist after the merge)",
