This happened in her linux machine in the brave browser. I believe to have solved this issue using padding on the words of 0.5rem, but I am unsure, since I cant test it myself. Joshua Minimalsm and I tried recreating it, but we couldnt in both of our devices. I have committed and pushed my code into a fork, but I am wondering if people could test it. If the cut out words still happen I am planing on increasing the width of the SVG as that should solve the issue too.",
