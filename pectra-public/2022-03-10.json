        "content": "Regarding those two points:\n```\n4. Consensus Layer client software **SHOULD** poll this endpoint every 60 seconds.\n\n5. Execution Layer client software **SHOULD** surface an error to the user if it does not recieve a request on this endpoint at least once every 120 seconds.\n```\nShould this be done only  pre merge or post merge as well? \n\nAnd I see potential issues by using `SHOULD` instead of `MUST`.\nConsidering the following setup:\n1. the CL client does not call the endpoint at all (which is within the spec)\n2. the EL client expects the endpoint to be called every 2 minutes (which is within the spec)\n\nThis would result in the EL generating an error every 2 minutes, even though nothing is wrong. As a user this would be misleading, because seeing an error regularly pop up would imply that something is not working correctly.",

The general idea of this endpoint is to provide ability to pull configuration from EL to be sure that it's ready for the merge. I think that user will investigate into the reasons of behaviour you have described and figure it out that CL client doesn't support this feature. I do also expect that all CL clients will implement it as it is recommended",
