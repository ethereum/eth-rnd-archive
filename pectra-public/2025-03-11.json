        "content": "In a nutshell - serious cat herding to get validators back online, if need be by using a centralized CL that ethpandaops offered. CLs were using special rescue builds all along to make sure they were on the right chain.\n\nNow that we have a finalized block everyone can run the vanilla client images again, and syncing against a recent checkpoint in minutes works well.\n\nSomewhat obviously this isn’t feasible if we ever have such an issue on mainnet.\n\nI am hoping to see:\n- Regular extended non-finality testing to harden clients for that. I believe pandaops said they now would, although it’s expensive.\n- R\u0026D into a better recovery mechanism should we have a correlated, consensus impacting, \u003e2/3rd bug on mainnet. It’s not as unlikely as was maybe thought. But also, figuring out a recovery mechanism that can’t be gamed by a genuine attacker is fiendishly hard.",
