        "content": "Thanks for the help... I got validator  up and launched (Prysm) and deposited 32 Eth to the deposit contract using the Ethereum Launchpad Ropsten version (thanks again).  My beacon node (Prysm) is running fine and my EL (Geth) is also fully synced \u0026 running fine.   Problem now is my validator appears to be stuck as the deposit is not yet recognized by the beacon chain.  It's confirmed successful on the ropsten etherscan, and when I go here: https://beaconchain.ropsten.ethdevops.io/validators/eth1deposits  - I see my deposit on the eth1 side with my validator public key.  But I'm stuck with this in the validator:  INFO validator: Waiting for deposit to be observed by beacon node pubKey=\u003cmy pub key here\u003e status=UNKNOWN_STATUS  -  And Looks like is just not yet recognized on the beacon chain side here: https://beaconchain.ropsten.ethdevops.io/validators/eth2deposits .  Is it just a matter of waiting it out now?  Or has something gone wrong?  Anything else to do but wait to be inducted?",

As I am already validating on mainnet with my Geth+Lighthouse Clients, I would like to try out the upgrades on a different machine with other client instances and not touching my existing setup. Does that make sense? Or is it recommended to stop validating on the mainnet and fully transition to Ropsten?",
