        "content": "Fork choice poisoning is only possible during the merge transition. The root of this attack is in having two sources of chain data at the same point, thus, two data availability problems. After these two sources of data get merged into one this issue disappears. Worth noting that even without a safe net in place fork choice poisoning has low probability to be employed. With a safe net that is currently in the spec the probability is negligible.",

        "content": "It's not only a matter of optimisation. The reason why CL must share current head of the chain with EL is in how some EL clients are syncing. Considering fast/snap sync, state trie versions further than 128 blocks behind the head is getting pruned, thus, making impossible for EL clients relying on these sync algorithms to get synced with an older state. And CL client have to gossip and serve optimistic blocks via req/resp to avoid descoring/disconnecting and keep an ability to stay online to receive data required to keep syncing.",
