        "content": "I think this would only make sense if withdrawals were done earlier, say beginning of December 2022 (2 years after Beacon Chain launch). There are some clear pros + cons to this approach though:\n\nCons-----\n- Upgrades are generally planned for every 6 months, so doing withdrawals earlier would break this cadence\n- Would need to do 2 forks during a time when only 1 was planned, to not delay other EIPs (e.g. 4844)\n- As per Tim, core devs are burnt out from the merge sprint, need some well deserved time off\n- If Tim + co agree to take a 1 month break from ACD/CL calls after the merge, then that doesnt leave much time to plan / implement a December hardfork\n\nPros------\n- Withdrawals will in theory boost Ethereum's decentralization, security and censorship resistance;\n-- Withdrawals should help reduce the dominance of staking pools, as it gives users the ability to exit staking pools and become solo validators (e.g. via rocketpool) or choose other pools (\"the great reshuffling\" as coined by Anthony Sassano)\n-- Some of the short-term censorship mitigation techniques Justin Drake discussed on Bankless require withdrawals to ensure that users have a fair chance to get out before a censoring staking pool operator is penalized\n-- Enabling withdrawals should lead to more stakers / more ETH locked up, as the vast majority of the execution risk of being a staker is gone, making it more costly to attack Ethereum\n\nI think rushing the devs is a non-starter, i.e. the strongest argument NOT to do withdrawals early. But curious to get devs' perspectives?",

        "content": "The single biggest risk of not allowing withdraw is actually what ETH foundation is trying to battle against - centralized validator failure like lido. If a staker got punished when delegated validator goes offline, a staker lost money if validator  goes bankrupt, and a staker’s only liquidity is to sell in liquid market, then there is no reason for a staker to use small validators, and it’s only rational for everyone to crowd lido - where you got Liquidity and operation scale. Then if lido becomes defunct or sanctioned at protocol level, it will bring the whole ETH down with it. From this perspective, allowing validator withdraw or change shall be the most urgent EIP to implement after merge",

There were numerous reasons **for a casual user** to NOT run a home validator when the beacon chain launched 2 years a go.
