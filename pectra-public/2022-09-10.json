        "content": "If chain slows down or some validators could not propose, take some time to fix it. If block reorgs or chain crashes or hangs, pause it and fix it. Does not sound that hard. But I think all CEX and bridges will pause for a few hours watching for PoS chain to get stable and ETH prices might get volatile during that a few hours. Fun to watch",
