I’m slightly familiar with ETH networking. But i’m very interested in all vectors of censorship in ETH. So I would just follow the channel since it’s my interest. Starting from the channel, folks like me could dive deeper into block-construction, etc, if it’s related to censorship.\n\nIn any case, if you don’t want to make it, it’s fine and just tells us a bit ETH policymaker priority. Which is: having a channel for “verkle trie migration” and none for “censorship resistance”.\n\nI will shut up since the discussion is off-topic for merge-public.",

It really is rather focused on R\u0026D (core development). It may feel hostile, but it e.g. isn't the place to ask \"what is Ethereum doing about \u003cX\u003e\", or to have general discussions on the topic (\"Ethereum _should_ be doing \u003cX\u003e, or maybe \u003cY\u003e\").\n\nI would say \u003c#824798757618188339\u003e the last few days is a good illustration of what this server is for; developers/researchers asking rather specific questions to other developers/researchers and figuring stuff out together. There are shades of grey of course.",

I'm also mostly just a lurker, but I have been around during some noisy periods and then it's just annoyingly hard to keep up.
