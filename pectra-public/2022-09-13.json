How does it work to protect against censorship with say a OFAC geth fork if real-asset-backed applications such as USDC decide to side with OFAC geth essentially making USDC worthless on any other fork, even a majority socially agreed upon one, aside from the OFAC approved chain. isnt this a serious weak link in censorship resistance? Whats the solution here?",
