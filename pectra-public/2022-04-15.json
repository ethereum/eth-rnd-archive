The upgrade on the execution chain (Paris) is happening at a certain amount of total difficulty in about 2 weeks after that, probably 10 days after Bellatrix. Client software (both EL and CL) will be upgraded before Bellatrix, I guess 4 weeks before the fork is usual time when clients are released.",

This opcode will thus be a stronger, albeit still biasable, source of randomness for application developers to use than BLOCKHASH.",
