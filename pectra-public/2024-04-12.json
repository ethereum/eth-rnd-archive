If you set compounding creds then you get 62 ETH validator which rewards won't be skimmed automatically until when the effective balance reaches 2048 ETH. But you can use partial withdrawals to withdraw any amount unless the balance goes below 32 ETH. So in this case 30 ETH can be partially withdrawn, but this withdrawal will go through the exit queue and is a subject to withdrawability delay\n3. There are two ways as per the today's spec: 1) top-up a validator with 0x02 type but the same address 2) consolidate one validator to another -\u003e target's creds are automatically switched to 0x02\n4. No ceilings, but if they were, everything above 60 ETH would be automatically skimmed",
