I read through the EIP-4844 and noticed it mentions  the blob tx contains `[chain_id, nonce, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, to, value, data, access_list, max_fee_per_blob_gas, blob_versioned_hashes, y_parity, r, s]`. I am wondering how is the \"blob sidecar\" sent to the CL node?",
