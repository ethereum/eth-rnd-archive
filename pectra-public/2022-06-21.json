In regards to \n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/892088344438255616/988633836193742888\n\nI think less than 256 bits would generally be better for proving time:\n\nAs an analogy, in a 64 bit architecture, the word size is 64 bits, so if you have a datatype which requires more than 64 bits to encode its information, then you'd need multiple words. Like a u65 would need 2 64 bit words. Also adding a u65 would have more complexity to it than adding a u64 or something than is less than 64 bits.\n\nFor zk proofs, we usually have a word size that is just less than 256 bits, so to encode a 256 bit number we would also need 2 words/field elements. If its not used too often, it might be okay I think, I'd need to check the exact system/usage to determine whether the blowup may be significant.\n\nReasons I would not go for 234 bits would be because it may reduce the security of the system as a whole, If we are using 234 bits or even less in other places, then this may not be a valid concern though.",
