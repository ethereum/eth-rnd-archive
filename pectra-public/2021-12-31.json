We’re still sitting at ~7% staked and seems like that percentage has not really moved up meaningfully in recent weeks \n\nI understand the appeal of having ether be deflationary, but does it make sense to increase rewards to stakers to get us closer to a state where the merge is actionable? Right now we’re barely over halfway there",

The deposit Merkle tree can be significantly compressed by discarding old deposits and transmitted to newly syncing nodes during weak subjectivity sync.\n\nI've implemented this in lighthouse and Zahari has implemented it for Nimbus.\n\nNow we want to write something up to explain how to implement this, and get the ball rolling on standardizing the data structure used to transmit the deposit tree, and standardize the beacon API endpoint to fetch the deposit tree.\n\nMy question is where do I write this? Does this need an EIP?",
