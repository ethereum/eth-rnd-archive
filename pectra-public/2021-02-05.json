ETH1 needs them. I am almost certainly in the minority on this next comment, but I am actually for increasing the block reward (even exponentially if needed) in the days leading upto the merge to ensure a smooth transition to PoS.. we cannot afford to hashpower drop-off and potentially expose the chain when it is the most vulnerable right before the merge...  for the record, I am not a miner, nor am i mining.. quite the other way around..  RE gas limit, i do hope that feature is brought across as post-merge anything that can be done to help w/ transactional flow is (in my eyes) on the critical path..",
