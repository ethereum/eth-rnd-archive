I'm thinking for things like running a fleet of eth1 API servers it might make more sense for the consensus layer on each instance to be a light client connected to some internal \"full\" consensus instances?",

Also, light client sync data has `BeaconBlockHeader` and using it as a consensus client would require a corresponding block body request to obtain the execution payload. So, in general it can work but this kind of scheme has implications.",
