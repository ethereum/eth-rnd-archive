        "content": "Awesome!\n\nI have few questions regarding EIP 7002: \n1. Will there be any time difference between exit triggered from execution layer vs voluntary exit?\n\n2. Since, there is a limit on number of exits that could be processed in a block, is there a preference given to one way of exit over the other? In the modified process_operations function :https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/7bf43d1bc4fdb91059f0e6f4f7f0f3349b144950/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#modified-process_operations \nThe voluntary exits are processed before the execution layer exits. So, is there a possibility that no execution layer withdrawals are processed in a block if the number of voluntary exits meet the limit of validators that could be exited? \n\nThanks!",

EL triggered exits incurs a fee which is as a spam protection mechanism and are processed after VoluntaryExits as you've pointed out in 2)\n2. EL exits/withdrawals are processed regardless of a number of VoluntaryExits in a block, but they are queued after VoluntaryExits of the same block.",
