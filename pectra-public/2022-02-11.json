The spec defines transactions array as follows:\n\u003e `transactions`: `Array of DATA` - Array of transaction objects, each object is a byte list (`DATA`) representing `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction` as defined in EIP-2718\n\nI.e. the spec reflects transaction representation on EL side",
