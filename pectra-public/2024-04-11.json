Custom ceiling: If I set a custom ceiling at 60ETH and I deposit 30 on top of the already present 32, the 2 extra ETH will be withdrawed in the next withdrawal (without setting compound credentials)\n2. What happens in this case if I set compounding credentials?\n3. How will the process for setting 0x02 credentials look like? Similar like setting 0x01? So just another withdrawal credential update?\n4. If a user activates compounding and set a ceiling at e.g. 60 ETH -\u003e if the ceiling is reached after some time will everything above 60 ETH withdrawed again?",
