For the existing networks, will Goerli/Prater get some new combined named, or will we need to run our CLs w/ `--network prater` and ELs w/ `--network goerli`?  Actually for that matter will the CL networks that are created for ropsten and sepolia have unique CL-style names or will they simply be `ropsten` and `sepolia`?",
