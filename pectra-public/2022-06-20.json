With every delay of the merge (for security reasons, ofc 😉), resulting in delay of Shanghai and 4844, L2s will be forced to switch to third party DA layers instead of eth L1 to settle data txs, to cut down on fees. Third party DA layers which are \"centralised/controlled\". And once again, we will blame these third party protocols for being less safe instead of looking in the mirror and reflecting that the core L1 roadmap being unable to deliver on time gave rise to these insecure outsourcings in the first place",
