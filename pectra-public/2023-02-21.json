Maybe part of this friction is innate to writing better specs, and we should just grit our teeth and bear it?\n\nI saw the recent call for EIP editors from the CL side, and while I appreciate that, I wouldn't really want to volunteer as an editor myself because I've got enough going on and the EIP process is pretty peripheral to most of the work I do. If it were more integral (i.e. the CL had a culture of using EIPs) then I can imagine that position being more appealing.",

I think it's maybe fair to say that my EIP is in the top 5 *most standard conformant* EIPs that have been written (all sections included, pythonic reference implementation, test cases that the implementation passes, etc.) and despite all that effort, I still had to deal with quite a lot to get my most recent PR through.\n\nAnd that was with the support of other prominent devs and editors going to bat for me (lightclients, Pooja, etc.).\n\nGranted the incident did lead to a policy change and was kind of a flashpoint that the process needs improvement.\n\nFrom my experience, the issue was that you needed basically unanimous support from the editors. So even one or two people with reservations can be enough to significantly slow down or stop the process.",

I agree that having input from a wide range of stakeholders is important though. At risk of bike-shedding I would be down to talk about reducing friction in the EIP process.\n\nI sympathize with this, and appreciate the general feedback! Worth noting that we've added a CL EIP editor (\u003c@792822129019584562\u003e 👋 !) to help make the process easier for you all! Also, \u003c@689161464829050960\u003e and others have been doing a ton of work over the past year to make things smoother. \n\nRe: the specific points:\n\n\u003e - I wasn't able to include test cases as an artefact alongside the EIP, they needed to be in a separate repo or inlined in the text (very impractical). As a result, my EIP doesn't even link to the test cases, they just got passed around out-of-band.\n\nThe EIP repo isn't the right place for most tests, but we've loosened the rules on adding links (rules where there to prevent link rot), so if you want to write an EIP to describe a change, and have the tests in, say, consensus-specs, that should be possible. \n\n\u003e - The emphasis on writing in a \"timeless\" manner is frustrating for an evolving technology. I had to remove any reference to any extant client or implementation because these were considering too liable to bitrot (concept rot?).\n\nThat seems like something we could probably improve on 🤔 Would need to understand better. \n\n\u003e From my experience, the issue was that you needed basically unanimous support from the editors.

Seems like something where the constraint could be relaxed if so, though!",
