Its gonna take some time to do it right, half the work is educating people so they don't enter a random URL in the CLI. \n\nAs a stop gap, we'll work on one that the EF runs for now, so people can actually use WS sync reliably and make it better as we go forward.

A Centralized point of guide for everyone. (I think these already exists and sufficient to some extent). Bonus if there's just a quick checklist for people to check with depending on their needs, e.g. if u're a staker, u need x,y,z,etc\n\n2. A  socialization campaign across social media. (Not just through EF official account but also maybe through some coredevs with large following, and you too Tim!) I would like to see it also on reddit and crypto centric subreddits and even ethmining subreddit if possible.\n\n3. Sustained call to action - we need to remind people consistently so if we're doing it through social media, we probably need people to repost things consistently for quite a while",
