Anything that assumes about 13 second block times is likely already broken anyway. \nThe only thing I can think of is if a contract was intended to lock some funds up until a point in time and then inexplicably decided when that time is based on the block number instead of time stamp. But even then the contract is doing exactly what the original code intended so I can’t see how it could be considered broken.",
