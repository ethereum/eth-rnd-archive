So, once TTD is reached by the mainnet, a beacon chain proposer will produce a block containing execution payload with transactions from the mempool.\n\nWhat I have referred before is mev-boost (https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/) which will be activated an hour after the merge transition is finalized.",
