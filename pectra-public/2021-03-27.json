        "content": "Very high level yes. As I understand the current state of the design discussion, there would be an application client: An adapted version of the current \"eth1\" client. That connects to a beacon client for consensus. The application client runs the EVM, and does maintain a separate chain, but consensus for that chain comes from the beacon chain. The rough steps as they were laid out here recently were:\n1) Consensus Upgrade\n2) Eth1Data follow distance cut\n3) BEACONBLOCKROOT opcode\n4) Validator withdrawals\n5) Merge chains (app with beacon)",

That doesn’t mean some clients won’t provide combined packages that run them both in the same process but conceptually it’s likely that we will always run separate consensus clients (beacon node) and application clients (eth1). \n\nYou have a single chain already as soon as 1 is done because the application layer state root winds up in the beacon block so it includes all the eth1 stuff. That chain just has some weird properties like following itself for deposits but 2048 blocks behind which we need to clean up. 🙂",
