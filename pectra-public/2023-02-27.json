If your validator seed phrase has not been stored securely at all times, please consider using CLWP:\nhttps://github.com/benjaminchodroff/ConsensusLayerWithdrawalProtection\n\nAfter 2/28, we will still allow submissions via Kleros curate moderated list - which requires staking 0.474 ETH (refunded after one week if valid):\nhttps://curate.kleros.io/tcr/1/0x479083b5343aB89bb39608e3176D750c8A6957B5\n\nWe will stop moderating Kleros submissions 14 days prior to mainnet Capella, but submit early as community members may start loading the GitHub submissions earlier. Feel free to check if your validator is compromised by searching the 1724+ submissions for your index number.",
