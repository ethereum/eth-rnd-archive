Blobs aren't just a simple byte array that's passed around, they're 4096 field elements in something something mathy whatnot thing (Dankrad tried to explain the full math to me twice but it was my 5am so...). There are two big advantages for this, firstly it sets the groundwork for data availability sampling that's planned for full danksharding which reduces networking requirements and improves reliability.  Secondly, it allows a small part of a blob to be loaded and proven. If you use a simple keccak or sha256 hash to verify the data you have to post it all, but with the kzg commitments used you can post a proof of just the smaller slice of data.  This is a big advantage for things like fault proof systems which in a dispute may need to access some of the actual blob data in the EVM (and thus post it as calldata during hte dispute process).",
