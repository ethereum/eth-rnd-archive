But the second epoch post-merge has a lower participation rate, and devs are looking into why that is. Could be because of something as silly as the monitoring systems having a problem, or something more nefarious, too early to tell. \n\nYou can follow via this URL: https://sepolia.beaconcha.in/charts/slotviz and here: https://sepolia.beaconcha.in/epochs\n\nFirst post-merge epoch was 3600, you can see it finalized with 94.52% participation, compared to 94.57% pre-merge (epoch 3599). As per Danny Ryan, consistency is key here, so that's promising! But second epoch (3601) participation dropped to  68.48%. That's still enough for the chain to finalize (need to be more than 66%), so that's good, but obviously that number should be higher! Will wait for more info from devs!",
