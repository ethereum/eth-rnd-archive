Assuming `eth_blockNumber` is on the list, will it work to implement the ping feature? Or does this feature require `engine_` method to discern from regular `eth_` calls?",

        "content": "I thought about this a little more, first about using alternative RPCs like `eth_chainId` or `eth_getBlockByNumber(\"genesis\", false)` but then realized that while these or `eth_blockNumber` show that there is an EL listening, they _don't_ prove it's _configured_ correctly.  I think the main benefit of a specific `engine_` method is it would indicate that the EL you are talking to is correctly configured to receive `engine` RPCs, which might not be the case (e.g. w/ current `geth` one has to run w/ `--catalyst` to expose the engine API, would be ashame to miss the fork because you forgot to do so).\n\nSo, IMO the _best_ hearthbeat would be an RPC, _in the engine namespace_, that ensures that the EL is configured \"correctly\".  This is where my knowledge of the CL/engine API breaks down, but I could see that including:\n\n- what chainId is the EL running? (is it the chainId that the CL expects to be docking w/ this beacon chain?)\n- some amount of \"genesis\" information (for example the `eth1data.deposit_root` mentioned here: https://github.com/parithosh/consensus-deployment-ansible/tree/master/kintsugi-testnet/custom_config_data#kintsugi-devnet)\n- the EL's terminal total difficulty\n- the EL's \"state\" (e.g. current head and distance from TTD)",
