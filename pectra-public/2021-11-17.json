The step after this one is to rename `coinbase` to `fee_recipient` on EL which probably doesn't worth the complexity as it also involves JSON-RPC (which names this field as `miner`) and the `COINBASE` opcode.\n\nI am just thinking about renaming `feeRecipient` to `suggestedCoinbase` in the Engine API as the easiest path forward. Though, I don't understand the `coinbase` term hence don't like it, everyone seems to be pretty familiar with the thing it denotes in the context of EL block.",
