At that point, the deposit contract state could be modified to show a 0 balance and deposits could use a more native system capability. Or if  nothing like that happens, that addr could just be considered inaccessible and subtracted from total supply calculations\n\nSo yes, if it isnt directly addressed in some.sort of clean up state change, accounting for total supply would need to explicitly take this into account",
