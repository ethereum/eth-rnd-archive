We will broadcast these submissions at the Capella hard fork. This may help you win against an attacker. We are accepting submissions until 2/28. Over 750 validators have used CLWP - happy to help anyone who has questions. We would greatly appreciate any node operators to load the CLWP submissions on their nodes to help protect others. https://github.com/benjaminchodroff/ConsensusLayerWithdrawalProtection",
