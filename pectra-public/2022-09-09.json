I think the reason it bothers me so much is because we (core devs as a group) have not come to any consensus on releasing withdraws in the HF after the merge.  It has been discussed a bit and certainly some people want it, but discussion for \"post merge HF planning\" was shutdown many many months ago, prior to any actual consensus that I remember.  Some people (I don't know who or how many) have been publicly telling people that withdraws will happen in the hard fork after The Merge despite there being no consensus on that fact nor even the opportunity to discuss it.  Now we are opening up discussion and using the argument \"well, we already promised people\", but those promises were made by individuals without any sort of consensus.\n\nThis rubs me in a very wrong way because it feels like a mechanism for subverting governance (whether intentional or not this time around).  If people with a large social reach can just assert publicly what will be in the next HF without any actual discussion, and then use the argument during consensus making that \"we already promised people this will be in the next HF\" it is a huge attack vector against our consensus based governance process.",

Withdrawals having merged specs on the CL and a CFI'd EIP on the EL was the \"bar\" where I thought mentioning it as \"likely to be introduced\" made sense",
