        "content": "On MEV-Boost at merge: \n\nCurrently many parties across the eco-system, from r/ethstaker to staking pools are gearing up for the merge and deciding whether to implement/guide users to use MEV-Boost.\n\nWhile the small delay at the merge before MEV-Boost is activated is certainly helpful,  there is still a large risk to block production post-merge if much of the network activates MEV-Boost and there is a problem.\n\nI am writing this to ask the EF (e.g. \u003c@552133098075193354\u003e) and CL teams to consider putting out guidance on whether they suggest  that users activate MEV-Boost prior to/at the merge, or if it would be better for the network to phase in MEV-Boost usage over time after the merge is complete and the MEV-Boost flow has had time to demonstrate its stability.  \n\nWithout any such guidance I fear that many users will assume that MEV-Boost has been tested/engineered to the same standards as the rest of the merge infrastructure, which I do not believe to be the case.",
