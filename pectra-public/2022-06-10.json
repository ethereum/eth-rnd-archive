It seems both goals are completely orthogonal and can/should be tried in parallel. Am I missing something?\n\nUnless the merge is no longer the highest priority (but client diversity is the highest priority now), then its fine, but we should state it clearly instead of artificially delaying the merge or artifially pressuring newer EL teams to be on par with geth maturity.. With a few exceptions, it seems pretty clear from the last all core devs call that the newer EL teams don't feel confident to claim (in soonish timeframe) they are ready for production use with high stakes validators / CL's connected to them. While the CL seems ready to go. To be clear: this is not a criticism towards any clients, I'm just trying to understand the decisions taken.",

So many protocols have been hacked or suffered issues even if they passed multiple audits. I suspect there will be things that go wrong and despite so many checks there have been issues on merge testnets. So best we be as safe as possible which is what’s being done.",

        "content": "as far as I can tell, the most important client diversity wrt PoS transition is diversity in CL clients, which we already have. For EL, status quo is already geth and thus far I don't see a technical reason why it should change with PoS. IMO we should persue EL diversity, but as an orthogonal matter (and not pre-requisite for merge).  One could also make the argument that you'd have less chances of things going wrong by using the most battle-tested EL first, and then over time transition to other clients as they mature and get better tested (after the merge). The risk of running into  EL bugs in the newer clients is not zero and shouldn't be underestimated either.",
