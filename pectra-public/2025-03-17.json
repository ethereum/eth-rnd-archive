        "content": "Yeah I'm aware, many of the problems come from the basic assembly on the hashing library. An unfortunate series of events led Prysm to use a goassembly version, which when it went to production shipped with a pure Go fallback for not-supported processors. The older hashtree version does not have a fallback and it does not have assembly for Risc V. Nimbus fallsback to a different library. Prysm only has the goassembly version that should fallback nicely to Go, but I think the bazel tooling doesn't work with Risc V. I need to get a board or setup an emulator well to dig into this, but I honestly don't have time for any forseeable future",
