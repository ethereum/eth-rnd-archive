Playing with blinded block proposal flow, between bellatrix activation and before Terminal Block reached, I found strange asking a simple question:\nHow we define  `ZERO` version of `ExecutionPayloadHeader` and `ExecutionPayload` relate to eachother? in the spec they are referred as `ExecutionPayloadHeader()` and `ExecutionPayload()` and when transitioning to Bellatrix the state will get `ExecutionPayloadHeader()`, but this do not correspond to an header of derived from  `ExecutionPayload()`. This because the hashRoot of an empty list do not correspond to the `ZERO` of Bytes32.\nLooks like an inconsistency, A consistent Header should look like:",

Correct me if I'm wrong. So the test `State.LatestExecutionPayloadHeader == ExecutionPayloadHeader()` will fail.",
