        "content": "Also I hope someone who truly understands ETH 2.0 development threads can clarify my confusion. From my understanding, ETH 2.0 will introduce POS with all the scalability benefits vs POW. My understanding is that ETH 2.0 will implement Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) not Correct By Construction (CBC). To call FFG a POS distributed consensus algorithm is stretching the truth and therefore over exaggerating ETH 2.0 scalability benefits (without Layer 2 that could be used with ETH 1.0 POW anyway). FFG is at the core POW with POS overlayed to achieve finality in epochs. It wont achieve any scalability because at it's core it is POW. CBC is true POS as implemented by the renegade Casper network. Isn't ETH 2.0 on this basis just propaganda and the whole Beacon/FFG thread is a waste of time. Please help my confusion.",
