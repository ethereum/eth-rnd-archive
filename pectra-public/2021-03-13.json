        "content": "What may be missed here is the role profit switchers like nicehash play. If there are multiple competing coins to mine pre-merge you will see a lot more hashrate on profit switchers which makes the pre merge situation more dangerous as someone is able to quickly concentrate hashrate to attack. I fully expect someone to attempt an attack pre merge or at least to consider arranging one. So if there’s even a chance it should be eliminated.\n\nAnd not to throw flak on any single entity but there is a pool famous for its massive manipulation of crypto markets which also owns most of the asic farms that will suffer greatly from a merge.\n\nA side chain with a slowly increasing difficulty bomb to de-incentivize an attack is a great way to mitigate this risk but I think additional measures are needed as well to encourage decentralization of hashrate. Also I wanted to add that a side chain you can test new developments on may be attractive. I know one of the justifications for rolling out 1559 now is to test it on PoW. \n\nEth is getting more centralized not less every month.",

        "content": "Paying out miners for keep building the PoW chain after the merge and let difficulty bomb killing it seems to be a reasonable way, considering pay outs on the PoS chain. It shouldn't change the game significantly as rewards increase near the merge could do. And it uses a built-in mechanism (difficulty bomb) to stop mining.\n\nThere are potential improvements of that strategy. Pay for empty blocks only and speed up difficulty bomb. But if we target difficulty bomb to make it near impossible to keep mining 3 months after the merge it could be enough.\n\nThe questions are. Should those payments be made in a trustless way? How much of engineering efforts would it need to bring this trustless channel on?",

        "content": "\u003c@273808422753796097\u003e The way I think about it is that miners have \"something at stake\" right now because they have hardware that is worth $X per operational time without Ethereum PoW mining and it is worth $Y per operational time with Ethereum PoW mining where `Y ~= 4X` right now.  At the moment, their hardware's value amortized over its life is `(x + y) * lifespan`.  One block before the merge, it is worth `x * lifespan + 2eth * share_of_hashing_power`.\n\nThis means that one block before the merge they effectively have epsilon \"stake\" in Ethereum's long term success.  Right now a miner with a 4 year amortization on hardware has something like `(2eth * 16,000,000blocks * share_of_hashing_power - y) * lifespan` (caveats here for PoS launch coming before their hardware reaches end of life) at stake in the future success of Ethereum.",
