If kept loosely coupled it seems like this could allow parallel evolution more quickly...\nAt this point in time I think we have this nice separation between the two for most/all clients and perhaps there would be advantages to formalizing that going forward?\nI guess this would also mean dictating logic flow and separation to clients though...",
