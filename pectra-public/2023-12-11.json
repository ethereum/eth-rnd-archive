I just learned  (thanks Ben!) that `excess_blob_gas` is a running delta (w/ a lower bound of zero) and thus theoretically can grow unbounded (if the network stays saturated forever).  I saw that geth (and I suspect most other clients) is storing it using a uint64.  Seems like each block `excess_blob_gas` can grow by at most the gas of 3 blobs (specifically `MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK - TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK = 393216`).  So _in theory_ the uint64 would overflow in roughly `2^65 / 393216 ~= 9e13` blocks, or just over 34 _million years_ of blob congestion (given a 12-second block time).  \n\nSo anyways if my math checks out we're totally safe unless we _really_ raise the per block blob limit in a later fork.",
