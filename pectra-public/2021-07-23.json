In the past it was discussed that when a validator exits, the funds are put on hold for a bit to let anybody who has evidence of a slashable offense submit one.  My question was then, if that same validator gets their miner tips for blocks they proposed in the execution layer, and spends them right away.  Does that not defeat partly the purpose of being able to penalize and withhold said funds from said validator",
