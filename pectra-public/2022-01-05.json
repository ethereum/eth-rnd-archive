That should tell you the fork info and you can ensure that altair indeed happened. \n\nA bit more tedious, but accurate way of finding out what's going on would be to get the block at that slot and check the contents to make sure it checks out. `curl \u003cWHATEVER\u003e/eth/v2/debug/beacon/states/\u003cslot number\u003e | jq '.data | keys'`  would tell you the block keys (in data). First i'd ensure that `current_sync_committee` even exists. \n\nAn altair block looks like this:\n```\n[\n  \"balances\",\n  \"block_roots\",\n  \"current_epoch_participation\",\n  \"current_justified_checkpoint\",\n  \"current_sync_committee\",\n  \"eth1_data\",\n  \"eth1_data_votes\",\n  \"eth1_deposit_index\",\n  \"finalized_checkpoint\",\n  \"fork\",\n  \"genesis_time\",\n  \"genesis_validators_root\",\n  \"historical_roots\",\n  \"inactivity_scores\",\n  \"justification_bits\",\n  \"latest_block_header\",\n  \"next_sync_committee\",\n  \"previous_epoch_participation\",\n  \"previous_justified_checkpoint\",\n  \"randao_mixes\",\n  \"slashings\",\n  \"slot\",\n  \"state_roots\",\n  \"validators\"\n]\n```\nIn terms of comparing genesis files, to make sure your genesis files are the same as what we use on current testnets, can you use this tool (https://github.com/skylenet/ethereum-genesis-generator) and compare the output, after editing the config variables of course.",
