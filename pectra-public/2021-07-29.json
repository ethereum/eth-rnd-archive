But for regular users maybe we can try to expose the `block_number` as the main number. This \"discounts\" the importance of the Consensus layer a bit as slot number would not be seen as *the main number*, but overall it looks like a solution that would not confuse regular users. There still would be some UI/UX challenges, for example, explorers maybe should show only non-empty slots by default (nice sequence of `block_numbers`), however, there should be an option to see empty slots too. Anyway, I think somebody could try to reach regular users and ask which way looks less confusing.",
