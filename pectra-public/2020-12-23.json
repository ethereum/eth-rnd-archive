        "content": "question.. once we have the \"docking\"... I am curious how missed blocks will be handled. In PoW, it is a race condition to produce a solution to the block given the difficulty. Thus if miner A is not avail, miner B (or C etc) will beat him to posting a solution. In PoS, a validator is assigned.. so if that validator is offline, what happens to those transactions? are they all just punted to the next block? or will an alternate step forward? or will (or even should) each block have a primary and a backup validator? (appreciated in advance).",
