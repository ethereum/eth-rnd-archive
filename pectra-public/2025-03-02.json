I.e. my attestation reward isn't influenced by the overall attestation rate. It might be interesting to consider an attacker (with a large amount of validators) deliberately forking the chain during an upgrade, while most operators had their attestatoins turned off. But even that should not be such a bad scenario. Node operators just turn attestations back on, let's say after 24h, on the chain that they believe is the canoncial one. and we will easily finalize.\n\nBut yes, the attestation rewards during an upgrade compensate in no way for the risks taking during the upgrade, so turning off attestations during the \"critical phase\" seems rational.",
