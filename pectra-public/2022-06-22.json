        "content": "Dear Community, Good afternoon,\n\n- Running a merge network with custom `config.yaml` without pre-allocated validators(without `genesis.ssz` ). Network has been started with pow in geth and beacon `powchain` service has observed deposits from `eth2-deposit` contract's event logs.\n- Network is currently running on bellatrix fork.\n- Now i am trying to start a fresh node(prysm/lh beacon with geth) and try to sync with network but beacon can not sync with our network. \n- After investigating beacon logs, beacon has not created genesis state yet. And geth can sync to TTD block then it is waiting for beacon's switch over. \n- And beacon client is waiting for min genesis validators and min genesis time which has already passed few days ago in our network. But before TTD, we have deposited more than min genesis validator count. But unfortunately  new beacon can not observe those deposits.",
