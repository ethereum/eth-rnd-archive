Asking this because I can't find any recommendations other than the one we have in the Kintsugi spec:\n\n\u003e Thus, CL client software MUST use headBlockHash value as a stub for the safeBlockHash parameter, and EL MUST simply ignore safeBlockHash.\n\nIf we won't have `get_safe_head` on CL side at the Merge I'd suggest to explicitly specify `headBlockHash` value to be passed as `safeBlockHash` parameter in CL spec.",
