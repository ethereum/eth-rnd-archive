Is there an option that doesn't require maiming the consensus on the eth1 side?\nWe could have a hard fork, where we just say: \"eth2 is trailing eth1 by `N` blocks, and a hard fork will occur at block height `h`. The `h+N` blocks of eth1 are considered non-canon, although block producers will strive to replay txs in the `[h;h+N]` range.\nWhat I would like to ensure is that if a problem occurs during the transition, we want to be able to fall back to a functioning main chain and try again.",

I agree with you regarding the hard fork that we probably need to leave a room for a step back, I was a little bit thinking about the transition process but it's out of the scope of the document I am working on.",
