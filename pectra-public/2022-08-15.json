It's nothing more than a temporary arrangement of convenience. If some mining pools begin to censor it is relatively easy for a miner to switch to another and the offending pool loses its hashrate and power to censor very rapidly. For example if Ethermine decides to start censoring the US sanctions list, it only takes a few seconds for a miner to switch to a non-compliant non-US based pool. And pools aside, with 15 second blocks, solo mining on ETH is still viable even for small miners and their identity is easily hidden with VPNs. Whereas PoS staking pools are generally custodians that hold the keys. Nevermind the fact that withdrawals aren't even enabled yet, but users will generally only be able to request a withdrawal and then if they have \u003c32ETH (which is a very significant amount of money right now) they face the very questionable choice of whether they're willing to trust some off-shore custodian with their stake.  With 32ETH they can solo stake, but if they want to validate those censored blocks they then run the risk of committing financial crimes themselves, and the withdrawal of their stake from the KYCed custodian draws a straight line back to their real world identity - making this a very, very bad idea for someone who doesn't want to risk federal prison. PoW miners can't be tracked like that. Through chain analytics its not going to be that difficult to identify solo stakers based on transactions made many years ago. With respect, PoS absolutely makes this condition worse. Mining pools hold tenuous power here, but small stakers NEED staking pools in a way that miners don't, and in this context, a solo staker is going to be far more incentivized to adhere to sanctions than a solo miner.",

I agree with `lightclient`’s replies to your tweets essentially.\n\nIn terms of censorship-resistant ways forward there are several:\n\n1. Enshrine a new non-flashbots relay as the recommended relay, which operates in a non-US jurisdiction. Currently the OFAC sanctions don’t apply in Australia so I’d have no issue running a relay myself (at least while the law remains as it is). I think we can expect to use the open source code that Flashbots are planning to release, or worst-case write a new relay implementation from scratch.\n2. Promote local block building using MEV variants of clients. If users could get 80-90% of the MEV without using a builder that would be amazing, although I’m not sure how feasible this is – would it require brute hardware, know-how, or both? (an altruistic MEV builder could help with this part, for the good of the protocol)",

If a censoring relay is installed as the default at the merge it will be significantly harder to change later.",
