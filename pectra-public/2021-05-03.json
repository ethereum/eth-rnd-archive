        "content": "I discussed priority fees with Blox Staking over the weekend. In their architecture, the execution engine and consensus engine are run centrally, and remote signers hold the validator keys. It'd be immensely useful if the remote signer could signal `coinbase` to the execution engine - assuming that's where it gets set - when it's that validator's turn to propose a block. That way, the priority fees can go to a different `coinbase` with each block, depending on which validator's turn it is. Understood that the remote signer is called by the consensus engine, so some intermediation between remote signer and execution engine would likely have to be done by the consensus engine.\nA fixed `coinbase` specified at start of the execution engine would not work well, since a single execution engine would handle hundreds of validators, owned by different people.",
