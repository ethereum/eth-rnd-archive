No chain could not establish finalisation due to the participation ratio 55% and 45%. \n- Waited for finalisation 5 hours but they could not merge automatically. Then i manually restarted the nodes with shortest chain.\n- Question is how would the network get the finalisation automatically without manually restarted the nodes?",
