        "content": "GSF5 is back to participating at ~95% now. Post merge we saw some nodes unhealthy(yet to triage why exactly) but they all self-healed in an epoch or so. Once that happened we stabilized at about ~86% - i.e: 4 or 5 nodes. 1 prysm-erigon seemed to just return syncing on fcu's but was stuck at a block, I'm going to assume it wasn't able to find it from a peer in time (even with static peers) but this self-resolved after like half an hour. 1 nimbus-besu node was out of disk space, it was resynced and is fine now. The remainder of a nodes had a problem that I'd let the Nethermind team bring up once they are done debugging, the fix for some of them was resyncing the CL but I think marek had an alternate fix that would've allowed the nodes to self heal as well. \n\nAll in all, its been a great shadow fork. We still have to drill down as to why proposals sometimes have few to 0 tx's in them - but I think both the Erigon team and Besu team already have working theories and potential fixes. We'll re-evaluate this once the fixes are deployed.",
