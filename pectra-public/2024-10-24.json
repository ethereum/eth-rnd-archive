But there are other business rules on the consensus side that have to be met to check a withdrawal request is valid. Once the request is received by the CL, this is what happens:\n1. first the request will be processed and, if deemed valid, a partial withdrawal will be added to the queue of pending withdrawals;\n2. When processing withdrawals from the queue, some other checks are performed and; if everything is fine; the withdrawal is actually \"applied\";\n\nSome references from the consensus spec side:\n- [process_withdrawal_request](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#new-process_withdrawal_request) \n- [get_expected_withdrawals](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#modified-get_expected_withdrawals)\n- [process_withdrawals](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#new-process_withdrawal_request)",
