        "content": "Would it be plausible to introduce a 'maturation delay' to block rewards quite a while before the merge, and have it's duration increase over time (so when the merge date is proximate the delay will be quite long). \n\nIn Bitcoin, a miner cannot spend their block rewards for 100 blocks (https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1991/what-is-the-block-maturation-time). \n\nThis seems like it would only protect against existential threats, since miner expectations that ETH prices would recover long term would leave them no worse off for attacking. \n\nA downside is that it would affect miner cashflows and decrease security leading up to the merge (with rewards still going to be paid out eventually).",
