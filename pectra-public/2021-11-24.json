Exposing it alongside the `engine_` at the same port won't make this dependency tighter.\n\nEngine API spec already has the following statement:\n\u003e To facilitate an Engine API consumer to access state and logs (e.g. proof-of-stake deposits) through the same connection, the client **MUST** also expose the `eth` namespace.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/specification.md#underlying-protocol",

For instance, current Engine API spec suggests EL clients to expire payload building process after 12 seconds has passed since the slot in question. Does anybody have more use cases for CL params reads from the inside of EL?",

I think this can be useful when spawning up bigger testnets. I intend it be quite complete, including tooling, like block explorers (EL/CL), faucet, a website to download the genesis infos/configs(could reuse the launchpad website) so that you can join the network if you want.. etc. It also collects prometheus metrics from all clients/apps. One command to create it all.",
