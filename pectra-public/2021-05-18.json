Assuming a successful merge and a successful pow fork, they would just both exist in isolation post merge. No danger to the actual protocol. Unquantifiable risk to \"brand\" or other soft features\nIn my estimation, the application layer will not do so well in a minority fork. E.g. unsupported oracles, defi collateral price collapses having ripple effects, etc\nAlso, difficultly bomb may or may not come into play on pow fork viability",
