We could make it update on demand as new txs come in, but it would need a little more logic to determine if the current slot's count should be added to excess or not. Also there originally wasn't a way to get the current fee so we thought that only changing per block might be a little more stable and reduce the risk that someone's request becomes stale. I don't think that is as much of a problem now",
