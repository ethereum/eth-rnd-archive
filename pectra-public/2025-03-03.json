Looking at some of the offline validators that have been down since the fork, they'll start reaching that tomorrow or Wednesday.\n2) Pectra's exit queue is not denominated by validators. It's denominated by eth - 256 eth per epoch. Which should accellerate the number of validators exiting as their balances bleed out.",
