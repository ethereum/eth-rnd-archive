We should be in a situation whereby the weighted overall risk of an attack is met with an appropriate level of response.

Someone doubling hashrate on one of the biggest and most decentralized crypto seems to score quite low in the feasibility of attack, but it is quite criticalif it were to happen.",

I would expect the tom foolery to only increase from miners as we get closer to the merge where profitability is so low that moving to a testnet for a few days does not matter. The solution is quite simple, if possible; change the testnet client TTD to a more smoothing calculation so it is relatively unaffected by large changes in hashrate. While this might be cheating, we know this part of the current TTD is solid and can be shipped with the mainnet release. This way we can move forward instead of spending too much time trying to figure out how to stop miners from slowing down the merge rollout until they figure out another way.",
