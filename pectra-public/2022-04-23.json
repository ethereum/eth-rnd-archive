Prysm was generating blocks very late causing a lot of missed head votes and low sync committee participation. Nimbus was producing invalid blocks.  Neither issue was related to the merge and both have been fixed. Just goes to show that all the best clients have issues with deposits - not sure why Lighthouse and Lodestar haven't caught on to that yet...\n\nThe actual merge went through fine despite those issues and having so many late blocks.  Now that both issues have been fixed we're seeing really high participation for attestations and sync committees. It's a very healthy looking chain.",

        "content": "There are also a few nodes still syncing the EL which has given us a good test of optimistic sync.  In particular some nodes had the CL in sync prior to the merge but the EL not yet sync'd.  It's not safe to optimistically import the transition block straight away (it's a whole thing, just trust me...) so these nodes *stop* optimistic import when the transition block is found and can't import any further blocks until its safe to do so.  By default that safety threshold is set to 128 slots, so they fall 128 slots behind the chain head, then go back to optimistic syncing.  Seeing that actually work in the real world for both the EL and CL involved was a good outcome.",
