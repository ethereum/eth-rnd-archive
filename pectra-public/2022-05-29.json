I had a thought/question about public testnet vulnerabilities post merge. An attacker/troll was able to mess with ropsten ttd timing at fairly low cost, because it's a testnet and normally has low hash rate. \n\nCould someone similarly throw a wrench into post merge testing efforts, by controlling a lot of stakeweight? If validator activation is often rate limited, they would need to plan ahead to build up stakeweight over time. But with very young beacon chains, there will be less eth staked, and this sort of attack will be much easier to do -- they just need to make sure they are a substantial fraction of all eth going through the queue during its relatively short life.\n\nHave you guys thought about this / how to mitigate it? Or maybe I just misunderstand something and this isn't actually something that can happen?",
