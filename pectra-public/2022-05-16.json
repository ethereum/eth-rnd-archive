I should definitely note that I'm using a very sad old macbook air with 4GB RAM, but according to htop there seems to be some space both with memory and processing power.  So is this a processing power issue or there some other reason that the beacon is running so far ahead of the execution layer?",

They started out different when the two chains merged and the beacon chain counts slots (including those without blocks) and the execution layer only counts blocks so they will actually diverge further over time.",
