        "content": "Hi everyone, if EIP-4844 enables a DA layer. Could this potentially provide file sharing/hosting as well? Even though blobs will eventually be purged cycled. I can see a sort of pinning service exist for keeping data available as long as someone pays for it, correct? At least arbitrary data can already be put into the calldata on L1 (see https://ethfs.xyz/). However this is still expensive. So, new dApps would 'exploit' this 'feature', right? So, there would be a possibility for L1 (eternal storage) and L2 (temporary storage + pinning) seems just like an inevitability or am I missing something? Thanks for sharing your insights",
