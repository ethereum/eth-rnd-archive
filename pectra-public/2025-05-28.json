        "content": "I got a question re the `0x02` upgrade for the validator withdrawal credentials. My understanding is that I can upgrade an existing `0x01` address to a `0x02` address by setting `source==target` in the consolidation request. What I don't understand is if I can also change the EL withdrawal address set from the `0x00` to `0x01` upgrade which is part of the `0x01...`. So for example, I have the withdrawal credentials `0x010000000000000000000000a684e47a0906f320960fa0487ace021535ad0e54` for a validator `X` and I want to upgrade that one to `0x02`. My understanding is that the `0xa684e47a0906f320960fa0487ace021535ad0e54` address cannot be changed for validator `X`, just the prefix. Is this correct?\n\nAlso, do current CL clients initialise new validator withdrawal credentials after pectra with `0x02` or `0x01`?",

To change the execution address you would need to exit and create a new validator, and that could be created with 0x02, or changed after it’s created.",
