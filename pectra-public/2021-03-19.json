It may “feel” early to start announcing any guidance; however, from my lens, estimating the avg lifespan of mining hw, the decision window to communicate to miners is now / rapidly approaching. \n\nSteps forward like the recent announcing the possibility of prioritizing the merge after an upcoming fork go a long-way to help miners make reasonable decisions. My hope is that the community can / will convey one layer further in specifics (more than priority) going to the targeted in X months for development and another Y months for testing (with huge emphasis on targeted but it is guidance nevertheless).\n\n(and yeah, there is the political risk to the foundation / community and more importantly to the security of the powchain if that guidance is waaay off)\n\nMiners have played an essential role since the launch. It is easy to crap on them today as being “greedy” when the situation that has played out RE high-fees is by-in-large not caused by them. With that in mind, PoS has been on the roadmap since PoW genesis, and no one has yet ever made / forced a miner to purchase hw or mine. Every assumption ever made for ** any ** investment decision always include inherit risks that assumptions may differ from what actually happens (e.g. 1559 and the merge). Of course, assumptions are based on the situation at the time and disclosures. \n\nMy objective with the above is that providing guidance when folks are making their investment decisions will help. It is of course not without risk to Ethereum. If done too early, the hash power for PoW may start to fall too soon due to lack of capital investment in hw mining. Though where the PoS chain is, along with overall state of “the merge”, the timing is quite close to “right”. My $0.02",
