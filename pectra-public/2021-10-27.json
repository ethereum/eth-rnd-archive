        "content": "Interesting. Do you see that observing PoS chain and simply taking a snapshot is more an arbiter activity than deciding which deposit contract to observe on PoW? I'm here mainly focusing on the case when exited validators build alternative chain and I don't see that it's an arbiter thing. That's something client devs can solve easily avoiding extra headaches for users. But I started to think now that maybe others are more concerned about the network split because of other reasons (say client bugs) as then it's really unclear which chain is a canonical chain.",
