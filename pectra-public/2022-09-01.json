If it's P2P nodes, then it's not necessarily that relevant, because the distribution of number of validators per node on CL node is highly unequal, and the part that matters is having enough validators, not enough nodes. Post-merge, because there should be \u003e= 1 EL node per CL node, one can at least reasonably infer that far from the EL charts, but each EL node might still correspond to basically arbitrary numbers of validators. People with lots of validators have absolutely been paying attention to this, whatever individual people running Ethereum miners might or might not be doing.",
