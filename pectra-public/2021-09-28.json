My understanding is that if `get_pow_block` only returns pre-merge execution blocks, then it's only ever going to return not-`None` on the first iteration. If `get_pow_block` returns post-merge execution blocks (i.e., not PoW) then it could run any number of times (bounded by `len(pow_chain)`).",

So, it should return `PowBlock` structure in response to whatever block hash is requested (if the corresponding block exists). The existing `eth_getBlockByHash` method is suggested as an implementation of `get_pow_block` abstraction.",
