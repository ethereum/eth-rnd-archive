Regarding the transition trigger, now the first `NewHead` event is regarded as the trigger for `PoW` -\u003e `Transition`. However when the first `NewBlock` event received, the local chain needs to verify the block with new rules since it's the first PoS block. Can we use the first `NewBlock` event as the trigger in the implementation wise?",

While `NewHead` could be sent only if a block has been processed successfully from all points of view.\n\nWhat if an updated client code would listen and accept `NewHead` from the very beginning upon deployment? Wouldn't it be easier to get implemented?",
