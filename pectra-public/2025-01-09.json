        "content": "Hello, I have questions regarding MaxEB. Let's say someone has 1000 ETH:\n1. Will partial withdrawals happen automatically every ~10 day and subtract earned amount since they deposited 1000?\n2. If partial withdrawals won't happen automatically can validator initiate it at will? For example when validator has 1050 ETH, can validator withdraw 100 so he has left 950?\n3. If partial withdrawals won't happen automatically, does that mean that validator will grow its effective balance and thus have \"more and more chance\" to be a proposer, if he isn't doing manual partial withdrawals?\nThnx",

Will partial withdrawals happen automatically every ~10 day and subtract earned amount since they deposited 1000?\n\n\u003e Partial withdrawals won't happen automatically, they are a separate execution request operation. However, if a validator has changed into a compounding validator (maxEB = 2048 ETH),  any ETH above 2048 will be withdrawn on the regular sweeps (similar to what happens since Capella).\n\n2. If partial withdrawals won't happen automatically can validator initiate it at will? For example when validator has 1050 ETH, can validator withdraw 100 so he has left 950?\n\n\u003e Yes. Creating a partial withdrawal 🙂\n\n3. If partial withdrawals won't happen automatically, does that mean that validator will grow its effective balance and thus have \"more and more chance\" to be a proposer, if he isn't doing manual partial withdrawals?\n\n\u003e The maximum effective balance of a validator with compounding credentials is capped at 2048.\n\nHere are some good resources related to MaxEB and withdrawals:\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwW6dNi9VCY\u0026ab_channel=EthereumFoundation\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyDChjFQEkQ\u0026ab_channel=EthereumFoundation",
