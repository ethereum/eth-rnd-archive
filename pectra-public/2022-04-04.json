If block times are at 20s in August, couldn't we just ask miners to increase block gaslimits to 40-45m to compensate? I understand that there's a speed and time-to-inclusion/finality impact with very long blocktimes, but I would think we could use block gaslimit to give ourselves a bigger window if needed",

        "content": "I tend to agree but first we need to ensure that making LVH optional for when EL is `SYNCING` is safe in all cases. When EL isn't `SYNCING` it must set LVH in the case when multiple blocks have been executed as a part of re-org to let CL know which of these blocks are invalid and must be discarded. For clients that runs execution on `newPayload` and doesn't do this on `fcU` LVH looks redundant as it's always gonna be set to a parent block in this case.",

Miners generally follow the devs guidelines when setting whats safe we’d love to increase it 10x and bring gas to 5gwei or less while killing the use case for sol and Ada 😛 And of course there's the conspiracy theory that the limit is set low because if its too high then going to pos will be impossible because home validators won't be able to provide good enough equipment compared to current pow mining pools using server data centres 😄",
