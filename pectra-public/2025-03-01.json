A way to de-risk as a node operator is when a network upgrade (like pectra) happens, to turn off your validators.\n\nyes, you'll miss some duties, but iirc if you're back online for an equivalent amount of time you'll make that lost ETH back.\n\nThis is at least one way one could have avoided being slashed in holesky it seems. Ofc there can be other supermajority bugs and u cant account for everything\n\nBut I'm curious how this plays out from game theory pov. If all node operators follow this, then no one will attest to the blocks after the upgrade and the new fork wont finalize. And I guess there's no incentive to take on the risk either of attesting the new blocks",
