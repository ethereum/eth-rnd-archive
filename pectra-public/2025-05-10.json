Something does not seem right. And now Launchpad button for \"Stake more funds\" is grayed out\n\nEdit: the tooling just didn’t do proper status code UX management. Proper response handling needed at launchpad error handling needed when user doesn’t have 1ETH. And beaconchain/beaconscan should not scare the user with warning or words of invalid when depositing to type2.  And launchpad should query to check status instead of sending duplicate request when user accidentally tried to consolidate minutes later with same index.",
