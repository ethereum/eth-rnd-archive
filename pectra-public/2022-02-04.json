This value MUST be either equal to or an ancestor of headBlockHash`\nSo we should (after potentially reorging due to the headblock) verify that the `safeBlock` is in the canonical chain right? In this case, should we return `INVALID` or an error?\n- Imo we should assume the same for `finalizedBlockHash` (that is in the canonical chain after the potential reorg). This is not yet specified in the specs though (afaik). Also again should we return `INVALID` or an error in this case?",
