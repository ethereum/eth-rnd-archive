        "content": "From https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/slashing/#slashing\n\u003e Slashed validators are eligible to be selected to propose blocks until they reach their exit epoch, but those blocks will be considered invalid, so there is no proposer reward available to them. This is in preference to immediately recomputing the duties assignments which would break the lookahead guarantees they have. (The proposer selection algorithm could easily be modified to skip slashed validators, but that is not how it is implemented currently.)\nSo - if we slash the super majority all at once - Holesky will go back to producing very few blocks. Is that right?",
