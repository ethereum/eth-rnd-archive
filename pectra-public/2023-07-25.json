So your best bet it to rely on that `devnet-name/group_vars/all/images.yaml` file to know which branch or commit to target. \n\nAfaik your testnet-bootstrapper will need to rebuild images from scratch, so you can't reuse the ethpandaops images (they won't have instrumentation available). So you'll most likely need to pin the commit hashes for the git checkout and build from there.",
