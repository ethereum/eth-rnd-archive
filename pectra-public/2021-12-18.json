I’m sure there will be some quirks, but nothing fundamental.\n\nThat fork choice “poisoning” issue is the only thing that keeps me up at night. However it does seem like it’s only widely exploitable during the transition.\n\nI think we’re going to have to work around that transition edge case by making some assumptions about liveness/finality whilst providing manual intervention methods (eg CLI flags) if that assumption fails. My next task is to iterate and compare the options we have there and probably choose the simplest and cleanest one.",
