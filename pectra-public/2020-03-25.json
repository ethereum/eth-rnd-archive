It would unlock data availability engine use case with quite a big delay, but anyway it's doable. Then if you want to bring this up to a level of practical finality you'll have to significantly reduce the follow distance on both sides. IMO, the most reasonable way of doing that is to treat Eth1 as a shard and invalidate Eth1 blocks that are not satisfying a number of validity conditions (Instant finality scheme).\n\nDoing all these steps bring us closer to what exactly the merge proposal is. Just need to add a couple of steps and we're there. That's why I've made this high level roadmap. It shows that the two-way bridge at its finish line is very close to the merge from technical point of view.",

It more seems to be a roadmap.\nIf to speak strictly about the approaches to two-way bridge, there are two schemes with miners to include finalized checkpoints on chain described in the document above. Yet I haven't explored the idea based on light client proofs brought on Eth1 chain. I am about to do this in the short term. But Isntant finality + attesting to Eth1 as to a shard looks like the most promising scheme.",
