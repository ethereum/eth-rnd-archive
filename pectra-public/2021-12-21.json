And if it's not then EL should respond with error, it also involves the case when `SYNCING` turns to `INVALID_FINALIZED_ANCESTOR`, I am not sure we can piggy back on `INVALID` for this particular case as the semantics is different and CL will have to react accordingly to this new type of error. CL may not always ignore them, in the case when this happens with canonical chain it will get stuck and would need manual intervention; in the case when this is not for the canonical chain CL may drop a message to the log and keep functioning. I am not sure that the gain is worth the complexity of handling all the edge cases.",

In general case, it won't be possible to execute payload with the parent block that is beyond finality. It would be ideal to use `eth_getBalance` to get `feeRecipient` balance after the payload is applied, but this call only supports blocks from the canonical chain which isn't suitable in your case.\n\nI would rather consider extending `eth_getBalance` than `engine_executePayload` + `engine_getPayload`. Let's continue this discussion in the PR.",
