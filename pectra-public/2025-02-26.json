I assume updating will cause a slash event. I'm new to running a node, and finding it super interesting to see how teams are coordinating to revive holesky! Also starting to better understand where to follow things..",

Once it's implemented in clients it will likely be hard to go back to how things were before, where slashing was just assumed to be unavoidable in cases like this.",

As is, recovering holesky depends on the majority being willing to get back on the minority fork, and propose enough blocks so that their own slashings can be processed and get the chain back to finality. That won't happen willingly on mainnet.",
