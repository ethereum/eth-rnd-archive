I feel like I've already lost this battle but will rehash my argument one last time: There is no accepted/implemented standard of the `eth` namespace, I don't think any two EL codebases export the same `eth` methods.  Instead, I feel like the spec should list the _exact_ `eth` methods required, and probably a baseline behavior for those methods. \n\nAs for the specific proposed methods, the payloads of both methods are _highly_ client specific so I don't think they are good candidates.  If the intent is to reuse existing methods I would go w/ a basic one like `eth_blockNumber`.",
