I am wondering how realistic is this. For the record, I am not trying to argue as this is an open question for me and I would like to figure this out. If this is a real issue then the merge is a game changer in that regard and it must be considered. \nThe question is. Does the merge makes verifiers dilemma such critical that we have to look for a solution to it? My answer: rather no than yes but it definitely worth to continue discussion",
