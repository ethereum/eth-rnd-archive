Or at least not multiple testnets. Users need to know they have a working validating setup in case of validators and that they can send transactions and tooling works in case of general users/devs. This can be done on an already merged long running public testnet without trouble",

        "content": "Worth noting that we can merge the same testnet many times over because we don’t have to shut down the PoA/PoW chain as part of that process. And in fact it’s much more realistic testing to keep it running since there will almost certainly be some blocks created past the merge point for MainNet. I don’t expect the continued PoW MainNet chain to have any value or survive long term (it might but I don’t expect it) but there will definitely be blocks that keep coming for a while and we want to make sure that doesn’t cause issues for the merge.",
