        "content": "For a validator post-merge, would it make sense to run 1 consensus client, 2 execution client and a failure sensing MITM proxy in between to build a more resilient infra. If the MITM proxy heuristically senses a failure of an execution client it can switch to secondary client. MITM proxy can send PreparePayload requests to both exec clients and only request ExecutePayload on the primary execution client. MITM proxy can even use both exec clients in round robin to increase usage of less used client? Would it work and is it feasible? (I'm sorry if this channel is not right place to ask this)",

It removes the complexity of handling dynamic TTD in consensus clients and prevents some edge cases. Also, it simplifies the mechanism preventing execution client to follow the wrong chain after transition in the case when the consensus counter party has failed or was misconfigured. \n\n- The PR https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2605\n- Issue describing the complexity and edge cases https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/2603",
