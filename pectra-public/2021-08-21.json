        "content": "On the \"every validator should run an execution client\" thing: this is dangerously simplistic.  I can go for \"we should maximize the number of execution clients\", as that is a far more realistic goal.\n\nTo be clear: an execution client is a very heavyweight piece of code.  It takes up a lot of CPU, memory, network and disk resource.  As it is, many consensus clients use a centralized service because the requirements are too large for their home setups to handle.\n\nRunning anywhere near a 1:1 ratio for execution clients to validators is unrealistic for everyone.  We can argue as to _why_, but the reality of it is clear.  If coinbase was not available in the spec version of the API it would result in there having to be a non-compliant fork (no doubt only of geth and one or two of the \"big three\" consensus clients, reducing decentralization of choice and increasing operational risk).  It would  result in overall fewer public instances of execution clients, as fewer people would want to run and keep up-to-date with forked software.  It may well end up with a paid-for service, where ultimately most people go through the same gateway to fetch their execution blocks, reducing the number further.\n\nGiven that the choice for each staker, with whatever way they have decided to stake to date, is either to run an execution client or not the aim should be to find the ways to maximize the number of execution clients.  This is done by increasing the benefits compared to the costs.  The simple fact that there are a large number of stakers that run execution clients should be applauded, given that to date the benefits are near-0 and the costs a very significant part of the overall infrastructure.  Increasing costs, especially in such an obnoxious way as to cripple the functionality of a node for a purist view of how the world should be and contrary to everything that has been built to date, would be a most regrettable step.",
