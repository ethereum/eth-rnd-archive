        "content": "Hey guys, needed a little clarification wrt EIP-7251. After the pectra fork, the minimum activation balance will be 32 and all validators opting in for the 0x02 withdrawal credentials will have a max effective balance of 2048 ETH. Further, the rewards will keep getting compounded with the stake value until 2048 ETH after which the rewards will be sent to the withdrawal address with the regular sweep. Also, in between if the validator wishes they can do a partial withdraw of any amount which is excess of the 32 ETH.\n\nMy question is, is there a way to lower this max effective balance or say set a custom ceiling? So let's say I stake 100 ETH and set a custom ceiling of 105 ETH and any rewards after that would be sent to the withdrawal address with the sweep?\n\nIf yes how and where can I set this custom ceiling? Would appreciate any help, thanks!",
