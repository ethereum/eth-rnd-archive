If you then filled all the rest of withdrawal capacity with partial withdrawals (~2ETH on average for the first scan, then much less), you'd get 7200 blocks x 16 withdrawals/block = 115200 withdrawals per day, of which 1800 were full withdrawals, so (115200-1800)x2=226800 ETH in partial withdrawals. So ~300k total for the first scan.",
