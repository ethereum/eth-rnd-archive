We have created a blog post with our experience putting together Geth with Splunk monitoring: https://medium.com/splunk-dlt/geth-hosting-with-splunk-62045c615ab4\n\nMost importantly, we used the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect Geth information and hostmetrics in one pass. It all works really well.",
