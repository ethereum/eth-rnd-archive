It is derived from the recipient’s public address but looks completely different each time. The transaction is then sent to this one-time address, not to the recipient’s actual public address. This means that if someone looks at the blockchain, they cannot tell who the real recipient is.\n\nIt is not a very high level of privacy,  but it provides a basic amount of privacy at the protocol level with a new private tx type.",
