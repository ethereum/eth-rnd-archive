That may not be the ideal attitude, but it’s the reality.\n\nIf you want full privacy (=untraceability + unlinkability), mixing is unavoidable. It’s the only way to achieve unlinkability. You can add extra layers to make mixers safer for everyday users, but you can’t eliminate the need for on-chain SNARK verification.\n\nAnyone who has used TC or Railway knows it works well for preparing an account with private funds, but it’s not ideal when you need speed and low costs.",
