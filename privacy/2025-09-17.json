For Kohaku the work it's still internal/not a public repo or roadmap (still working on legal stuff so it's well positioned to make it public)\n\nThe only thing I can say is that it's based on a fork from Ambire wallet so perhaps there's opportunity to study an integration and then have that merged into Kohaku. \n\nI'll let Kohaku lead know about this idea",
