Is it something that PSE is looking at closely only for end users? I'd be interested in my validator attesting with broadcast privacy, but the latency constraints seem prohibitive today. Is having a latency bound low enough to attest (or soon provide a 7805 IL) something that PSE is considering for broadcast privacy?",
