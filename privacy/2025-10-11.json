We've got a decentralized solver network planned to handle private settlements with recursive ZK proofs, keeping things liquid and MEV-resistant. For compliance, weighted threshold encryption on the ciphertexts lets users decrypt their own notes solo, but requires a t-of-n quorum for any authorized access via onchain proposals.\n\nFor offchain privacy, we are implementing a Sphinx-style mixnet of relayers to hide IP metadata and sponsor fees privately, alongside PIR-based queries with OPRF for wallets (stateless) to detect memos without exposing viewing keys or patterns.",
