We currently operate a vault on StakeWise.\n\nI've been chatting with Nixo on and off about the staking queue mechanics. Excited to see both EIP 8061 and 8080! \n\nI'm curious as to the reason why the EIPs are limited to addressing the exit queue/consolidation queues only? Why not consider increasing the entry queue throughput? \n\nAre there still concerns around validator set security or putting upward pressure on validator count (and the P2P layer) if people are running a lot of 0x1 validators? Or, is this simply an effort to reduce EIP scope? \n\nThanks for any and all insights!",
