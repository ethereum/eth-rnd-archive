People/projects/groups can just decide arbitrarily on a block number and compute a trusted setup up to there (anyone can verify this). I am talking about a public bulletin board where people can post their own version of  g^(x^i)  (for kzg commitments) for all i up to the max degree of the polynomial (transaction size is big but who cares). (One would need to protect against sibyl attacks, so make any transaction cost crypto in another currency (proof of burn style)). People would run the miners just because they have incentive in maintaining the trusted setup blockchain (tor like service).",
