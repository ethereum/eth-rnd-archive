I'm looking to see if I should implement the bindings to BLST or even KZG itself in Go assembly. The latter seems useless since the bottleneck is in BLS operations anyway, but still I suspect that BLST will do better than killic. It may be even worth it to port BLST to goassembly. We got about a 500% gain for the same sha256 assembly because of the overhead of cgo",
