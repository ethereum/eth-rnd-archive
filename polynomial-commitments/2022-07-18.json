The cgo overhead is indeed a bottleneck for integration into go-kzg, but there's a chance the BLST authors integrate the necessary KZG functions into their library, so the call overhead is reduced a lot (from 1000s of calls to just a handful). That said, I dislike CGO in general, so research into alternatives is great too.",

Porting BLST to goassembly would be a clear winner at least to Prysm and Geth but that's a large project and already porting hashtree was a pain in the butt",
