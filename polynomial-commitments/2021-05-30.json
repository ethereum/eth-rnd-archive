[s^k]` is a `48*k` size vector and each participant adds entropy into it by their stage of calculations, so the combined entropy space is not just `32` bytes, but `48*k` bytes because every `[s^i]` is sort of random w.r.t. `[s^i-1]` and can be thought of as `stretching` the entropy of `s` on the entire setup vector. this can be used to estimate a bound on minimum number of participants (anyway intuitively more the participants, more safe is the setup)",

But i don't think it would be prudent to assume every participant will add `32` byte entropy, but a fraction of it, unless `entropy` is really collected by eeach participant and not just from pseudorandom function. and hence still a minimum participant count could be argued to establish some bounds on entropy",
