My experience registering a validator with LaunchPad was very good overall and I'm really keen to see an instance up and running for Medalla.",

However, didn't have a very positive experience once I had to reach the page that asked the user to install python 3.7 + and the deposit util. Will there be one-click binaries we can just download and run instead? From our experience with operating the Onyx testnet, this will turn-off a huge amount of users, likely over half of the people trying the launchpad, if there are no simple binaries to run",

Convert it to binaries \n2. Use virtualenv, but it requires user to know some venv troubleshooting knowledge if they stuck\n3. Add sudo to the script 😓",
