Or might IDs eventually (in the short-med term) become huge hashes that fill the full `uint256` size?\n\nI have seen discussions around this when EIP-1344 was being defined, but I'm mostly just curious about ETH testnets as opposed to the standards definition.\n\n\u003chttps://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1344-add-chain-id-opcode/1131/91\u003e",
