Of course this is just an estimate based on our past usage, but anywhere from **5k-10k per month** would be enough to make our faucet sustainable. \n\nAnd in answer to \u003c@199561711278227457\u003e question around sybil mechanism, these are the following condition that we've put in place to prevent faucet abuse:\n\n- Google reCAPTCHA verification - prevent bot attack\n - Login requirement (get a rockX account) -get 0.05 ETH/day\n - Twitter account requirement (need to have a twitter account to share a post) - get 0.10 ETH/day\n - Discord account requirement - get 0.05 ETH, 1 time only\n - Make a successful API call requirement - get 0.20 ETH, 1 time only\n\n**Total eth claimable per day is 0.5 per user**\n*Note: Twitter account and Discord account are bound to the user's RockX account*",
