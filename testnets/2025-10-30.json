Please note that Hermes doesn't do any message validation at the GossipSub level, so we would also forward them back, but this also means that nodes originated them  \n\nI've done some debugging at a local Prysm node, and I can see that there were indeed messages that failed the validation, which does indeed point towards the hypothesis I just mentioned.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar levels of invalid messages or similar errors being reported?\n\nI'm only aware of this Issue at Prysm -\u003e https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/issues/15952\n\nCC: \u003c@531934490826768418\u003e",
