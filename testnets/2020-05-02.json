Teku is also printing a *ton* of errors from the networking layer, mostly because jvm-libp2p is treating any protocol violation from a peer as an error, some because disconnected peers aren't being handled quite right at various layers yet.  Now that we've got basic v0.11.1 networking compatibility I'm going to focus on hunting down all those errors to try and make things more sane.",
