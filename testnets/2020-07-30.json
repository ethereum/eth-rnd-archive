If we start a launchpad channel, maybe it should just be the key-management channel if it is technical. For tech-support for regular users, and collecting feedback, I think it is better to have a different channel or discord server. I will ask the people building the launchpad if they are working on something already, and/or maybe other community members will lead this support effort.",
