That's really cool! I think the best approach could this could be a really simple docker image that calls `./prysm.sh beacon-chain`, you can set the environment variable USE_PRYSM_VERSION to pin to a specific version. Or you could prepare the docker image with the compiled arm64 binaries. Let me know what you think",
