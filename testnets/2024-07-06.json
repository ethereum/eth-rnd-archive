As execution and consensus clients use UDP and TCP for peer discovery and further information exchange. there must be errors that encounter while maintaining peer to peer network. \n\nthere is a long list of error codes when it comes to TCP/IP . Is there any specific known error coded specific to blockchain peer to peer network that are not currently addressed? Moreover is there any tool like wireshark etc that can help identifying errors at network level. plz let me know is there any existing research on this?",
