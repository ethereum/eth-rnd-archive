For reference: https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/hoodi\n\nMy view is that we should be building out a network that looks as similar to mainnet as realistically possible, with a bit of additional headroom.  If we look at validators on mainnet right now:\n\n```\nPending: 417\nActivating: 394\nActive: 1051655\nExiting: 2\nExited: 770114\n```\n\nIs it possible to have genesis validators that are already exited?  If so then I'd love to see around 1.1MM active and 800K exited validators at genesis.  Otherwise, 1.1MM+ active to start with seems to make sense.\n\nRegarding amount of ETH in them: again, if we want to be close to mainnet then we should start out with them all being 32 ETH validators with 0x01 credentials (a few with 0x00 ).  We can do some very initial consolidation and compounding for testing, but if we start with lots of 0x02 validators we may find ourselves with a very different configuration to mainnet which would lose some of the validity of using hoodi as a testnet.",

That's the type of scenario that we should be ensuring beacon nodes an handle well, and as/when efforts to reduce or reuse the inactive indices comes around we'll have a good testing ground for it.\n\nExiting the validators post-genesis is possible, but a poor substitute as I don't think we 'll get anywhere near the required level of exited validators any time soon through voluntary exits alone.",
