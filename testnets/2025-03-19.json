The testing call particularly wanted to look at having holesky as the core dev testnet, but as external parties migrate off of it to holesky, we'd be left running the whole thing. We asked all the validators who intend to abandon to handover keys to us and we'd continue running it. (core dev testnet also partially implies we don't need to support it in an outward facing manner)\n\nWould there be any need for keeping holesky around for longer than half a year? It feels like we'd have learnt everything about exit queue dynamics by then and we can still use it for non-finality tests until then, perhaps even break it irrepariably at the end",

However i do want to be vary of time spent in co-ordinating and keeping around a network that isn't being used.",
