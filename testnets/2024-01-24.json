As far as I can tell the end result of that should be a loss of finality until we get above the 2/3 threshold again due to slashing and/or the automatic undoing of the change. That way the majority chain is pre-destined to loose after some time.\n\nThough I don't know how many insights you'd be able to get out of that.",

I don't even know the real makeup/distributions of Goerli currently, but one of the more useful things coming out of it will be to give all teams an environment, even if temporary, to collect data of performance on a very turbulent environment. If that's something useful at all for teams.",
