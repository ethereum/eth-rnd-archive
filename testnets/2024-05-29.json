        "content": "hey all, glad to be here 🤗 I have a client deploying many testnet rollups with sepolia as the settlement layer. The spending rate is ~3k sep ETH per month for running multiple sequencers. Atm, they're buying new sep ETH from secondary markets once funds are low. Is there any other way to retrieve some chunks of sep ETH in the range of 10k sep ETH per month?  We would be happy to run some public sepolia infra like validators or faucets in order to support the network as well 🙂",
