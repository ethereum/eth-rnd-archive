We are wondering if we're at a point now that we can delete \"start from deposits\" code and just always assume a genesis state in the db. This would open up a lot of cleanup opportunities.",

I guess you're talking about prysm using the same approach?\n\ncommand used to generate the merge state:\n`eth2-testnet-genesis --config config.yaml --mnemonics menmonics.yaml --eth1-config genesis.json --tranches-dir /output --state-output /output`\n\ntagging \u003c@892053833121923094\u003e in case the change affects hive",
