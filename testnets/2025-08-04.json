I kept them up running as part of the effort to get back finalization and kinda forgot about them. I don't mind keeping them up. It's just the teku client, not even the node since many of us couldn't get our nodes to sync after restart. Would you happen to know where to check to see when they'll exit? http://holesky.beaconcha.in/ doesn't seem to load.",
