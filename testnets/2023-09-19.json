Even if you are totally online, you mabye get 10-15% of your attestations in, so we are still bleeding out, just not as fast as the folks who are completely down.  But, we *should* get to finality sometime early next week when most of the folks who are down get ejected. And then we'll probably shut down to move on to the real deal.",

I'd like to have myself and my team run validators in Holesky indefinitely at scale to support and also enhance our infrastructure and operational capacity. Please let me know anything I do to help with rollout and if nothing needed for now, how I can get access to tokens in Holesky to run thousands of validators indefinitely.",
