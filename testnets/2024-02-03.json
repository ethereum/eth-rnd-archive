Of course I know how to compile geth myself but that means I would have to patch my system binaries or mess with my PATH, both things I don't want to do on a production machine which always follows the same pattern and just is unnecessary time spent on a testnet upgrade. I rather be offline one day than going that extra mile. If this is a problem for a testnet, I would suggest we go back to the old schedule we used to have back in the days: client releasrs 2-4 weeks before for testnets, 6-8 weeks for mainnet.\n\nWith this I definitely agree, and I would hope that node operators do voice these concerns on ACD, as far as I remember I was of the few complaining about the aggressive timelines and the eagerness to rush the fork on ACD, if it was up to \u003c@412614104222531604\u003e we would have forked Goerli in 2023  😂.",
