That said, maybe one thing we could do for Sepolia (and other closed validator testnets) going forward is to make it clear what response time we expect from operators for this.",

I'm quite sure we can make them more concrete based on what validators agree and reference that for the future). Also probably best to move that somewhere more easily accessible.",
