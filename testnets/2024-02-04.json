The time gained is indeed nice, but there are clear downsides. \n\nI think the \"letting releases soak\" directly affected at least one bug, probably more that client teams might have patched silently. \n\nHolesky should also give us a good amount of feedback.\n\n In general I think one operator being off in sepolia didn't change anything about our fork testing, most testnet forks we've ever done have been plagued by far worse rates of operator downtime, by that regard sepolia was the best we ever did outside of mainnet.",
