To ensure we won't ever have supply issues on it, I suggest we use the beacon chain genesis to inflate its supply. More info here: https://github.com/eth-clients/merge-testnets/pull/14#issuecomment-1152570001\n\nSince the genesis config hasn't been included in any client yet, I'd love feedback. It's also using a fork of a tool, so please do parse the state independently to verify its okay. If its deemed too risky an attempt - we just revert back to a regular beaconchain which wont inflate the supply much.",
