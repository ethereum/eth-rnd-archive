The time between sending a deposit transaction and the validator actually being active is really scary.  It would be great to have something that tracks the very tip of ETH1 (not trailing 1024 blocks behind like most nodes do) that tracks the whole process from getting into an eth1 block, being follow distance behind, the beacon chain eth1 data progressing far enough to make it available for inclusion, actually being included in an eth2 block, entering activation queue and finally being active.",
