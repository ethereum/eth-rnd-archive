I propose September 2nd at ~12pm UTC\n\nAfter a loose show of emoji support, I can make a config proposal\n\nCC: \u003c@\u0026836981489430036500\u003e \u003c@\u0026595681771690000403\u003e \u003c@\u0026595683849225240704\u003e \u003c@\u0026595681804422479873\u003e \u003c@\u0026595683609080365088\u003e \u003c@777935002263617576\u003e and anyone else with a horse in this race",

About 24 minutes later than Pyrmont but given we've seen the upgrade go smoothly once hopefully the Aussies can still make it to be about the same time as for the Pyrmont upgrade\n\nhttps://slots.symphonious.net has been updated with an upgrade scheduler to make the selection easier. 🙂",
