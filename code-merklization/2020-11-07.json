And anyway maybe it’d make sense to send that information in another way - for example, maybe a list of invalid JUMPDESTS, since those should be rare and such a list would compress better? No idea, just a wild thought",

Adding 1 byte of offset per segment, no matter the chunk size, would therefore be a lot of overhead for the (probably!) rare case of invalid JUMPDESTs.",
