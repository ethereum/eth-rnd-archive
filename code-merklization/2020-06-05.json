So, in my case, the fixed size chunks are not strictly fixed size, and they end with a full instruction. That means every chunk starts with a valid instruction not push data. It would be useful to see if this minor difference makes any impact.",

But there's not much difference to the jumpdest approach: the MPT key is the offset of the chunk (e.g. 0 for first chunk, 32 for the second, ...), the leaf is 33 bytes long (except last chunk could be shorter). First byte of leaf tells you how many of the first bytes are pushdata, the other 32 bytes are actual code. for an example see this test case: https://github.com/ewasm/biturbo/blob/merklize-mainnet-blocks/test/relayer.ts#L152",

And the fixed size makes the `PC` implicit... but I'm not sure this would be a good idea since it bakes implicit structure into the protocol.  The converse issue is that if we use the `PC` then there is additional validation that we have to do on the keys during generation to validate them...  trade-offs",
