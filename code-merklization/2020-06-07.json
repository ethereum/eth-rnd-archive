Unfortunately, there isn't a large proportion of contracts with this information in them.\nAll Solidity contracts start by setting up a \"Free Memory Pointer\". This is a location that contains the memory offset where the code can allocate memory variables from. As such, all Solidity contracts start with: 6080604052",
