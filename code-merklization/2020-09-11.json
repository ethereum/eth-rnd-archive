        "content": "We've had a bad experience with SSZ bounty in the past. Extensions/new abstracted features are a very niche topic, hiring/bounties are hard enough for more common things. When you bounty something, it needs to be somewhat familiar to others to get good results. Otherwise no submissions, or people get stuck and abandon their work. That said, if it's purely a documentation goal, to onboard rather than to dig deep, it may work fine.",
