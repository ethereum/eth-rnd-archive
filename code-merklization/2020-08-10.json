If something is great, but I do not see a good way of migrating Eth1 there, I am not very interested (but other people obviously are, and that's good!). Code merkelisation and binary trie-ification are definitely desirable. I just don't know yet whether it would be more realistic to introduce them before or after the first ReGenesis event. I know that you would say \"we should do it before\", but it does not mean that it will be easy to do, if you know what I mean 🙂",
