I have read this medium post https://medium.com/ewasm/evm-bytecode-merklization-2a8366ab0c90 and am somewhat familiar with the EVM. I am particularly interested in researching program/bytecode analysis techniques to guide merklization towards optimal encodings. I would love to talk to/meet with people to understand the current state of this research and figure out how to make a useful contribution. Thanks in advance!",

Based on the \"where to go\" section from your post \u003c@!259648573401071617\u003e, I guess my interests lie in leveraging bytecode/ast analysis for better chunking strategies. You mentioned a few people had ideas along those lines. I wonder if it's possible to do better than a simple fixed chunking strategy",
