        "content": "It completely depends on the demand for data-gas. The supply increases by about 5x, and does not wrongly utilize the calldata in the EVM gas market anymore, so data-gas will likely be priced lower than gas in the EVM. So anywhere between a 5 and 20x reduction for L2 I estimate, although this is super speculative. And it would free up a round 800K gas per L1 block worth of calldata usage, which means a 0.8K/15K= 5.3% reduction in L1 EVM gas demand that moves to separately priced data-gas, which should reduce the stress on EVM gas market a bit.",
