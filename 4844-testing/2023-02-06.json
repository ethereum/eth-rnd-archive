The `accessList` field in responses from geth is `null` in blob transactions (seeing this in `eth_getTransactionByHash` and `eth_getBlockByHash`).  In the blob tx definition in the EIP, this fields non-nullable, so I think this should be an empty list (assuming this is actually what the EIP intends).  If this field is represented in geth as a `Union` SSZ type, this will affect the SSZ serialization (not sure this is the case, haven't been able to verify the tx root yet)",
