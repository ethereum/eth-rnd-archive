I've written a guide on how to interact with it - https://hackmd.io/@inphi/Hk_cLBJFo. \nWe're only running one type of node combination; geth/prysm. I'd like to add more client interops to the devnet soon. This devnet is _tentative_ as running only a EL/CL interop can hide consensus failures that would arise if the network contains multiple client implementations. Once we get another EL/CL client added to the network, we can make it official.\n\nClient devs: Please attempt to peer with devnet 3 and let me know if you run into any consensus issues. Feel free to run experiments on the devnet, just try not to get your nodes banned.\n\nPeering with the devnet using Prysm doesn't work right now due to an issue with historical syncing on the client-side. Once the issues have been fixed, I'll update the guide with instructions on how to peer with the devnet using Prysm. However, other clients that have fully implemented the devnet-3 spec should be able to peer with the network.\n\nThanks to everyone that made this possible. Let's get at least 2 more clients into the mix before the holidays.",
