I hope this is the right channel, lmk if there’s a better channel for this…\n\nOne part about getting a blob on-chain is that there are two transactions, one to get the blob and one to fill it. A few things about this I want to know:\n- if I get a blob that is included, must it be filled with anything?\n- if I get a blob that is included, and I want to fill it with data, can i procure the blob in one step, then fill it with data “later”? Even if it’s just a few seconds delayed within the window before the block is included on-chain?\n- can I only get a blob in the next block, or can I get one in X blocks ahead? (Can I plan the exact slot/block this happens if so?)",

There can be max 6 blob txs per block. If the validator for the slot is using mev-boost then maybe you could send the blob tx as a bundle to control when it is included.",
