At first it was mostly Optimism people, and then some Coinbase \u0026 Prysm folks joined, and recently Worldcoin, Paradigm and more started showing up. This seems like the right time to make the calls public so that anyone from client/research/testing teams, or otherwise contributing to 4844 can join, and everyone has access to notes/recordings 😄 ! \n\nWe've been using 14:30-15:30 UTC on Tuesdays and will keep rolling with that. First agenda, and link to the notes from this week's call (last not public/recorded one) can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/647",
