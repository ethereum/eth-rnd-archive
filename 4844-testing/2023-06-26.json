Can we already call this (all specs bundled) a **release candidate**? Or are we still more in **alpha** or **beta** stage? 🙂 \n\nI know this question is highly subjective but I find it nevertheless meaningful since changes on 4844 specs where so heavy during the last weeks and I have lost a bit my intuition if this will go on an on or if we are rather stablizing.",
