I am still investigating why blobscan is not indexing any blobs atm.\n\nIn devnet6 we moved from lighthouse to lodestar and apparently the endpoints are different.\nCould you help me understanding why the endpoint to retrieve blobs in lodestar is `/eth/v1/beacon/blob_sidecars/\u003cblock_id\u003e` while in lighthouse is `/eth/v1/beacon/blobs/\u003cblob_id\u003e`? Are they the correct endpoints to query?",
