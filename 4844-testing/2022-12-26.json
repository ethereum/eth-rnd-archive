        "content": "I'm researching an issue where EthereumJS is producing a different state root than geth for block 1543 on devnet-3.  There's a single blob transaction with a single blob attached to it in this block but I'm noticing some odd errors.  1) If I call `debug_traceTransaction` with geth for the one transaction in the block, it returns an error of `block data gas exceeded` which doesn't seem correct since there's only 1 blob in the block.  2) If I call `eth_getBalance` on the sending account for the transaction on the previous block, I get a reported balance but Geth throws an error about missing trie nodes if I query the balance for the same account on block 1543 or later",
