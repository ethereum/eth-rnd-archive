We're collecting valuable feedback regarding the usage of the blob transactions under the upcoming Dencun fork by users and rollup chains.\n\nWe're interested in your insights and creative ideas for potential features you'd like to see incorporated into the block explorer web app (https://blobscan.com/) we're developing for this new type of transactions. Perhaps there are certain types of metrics, specific analytical components, visualization elements, or transaction details you would like to see? . We're also in the process of creating a dedicated API and would appreciate any input you have to offer. If you can spare a few minutes, please complete our Google form: https://forms.gle/KXASChJXCuwVcAxs6\n\nIn addition, if you're involved with a rollup project, we'd love the opportunity to connect with you directly. Please feel free to send me a private message here on Discord, contact us on our discord (https://discord.gg/WdgDVK2UPA) or schedule a time to chat via my Calendly link: https://calendly.com/0xgabi/30",
