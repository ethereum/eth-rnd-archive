While I assumed we would add just dataGasUsed to the receipt, your question does bring up the issue of how would one actually compute the contribution to gasprice from blobs.  You'd need the feePerDataGas (as computed by get_data_gasprice from the spec) but that's a nontrivial function with parameters that might change. Instead of dataGasUsed*dataGasPrice, we might just provide both separately?",
