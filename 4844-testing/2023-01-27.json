        "content": "hmm, I guess I see what you're saying but when it comes to the \"total cost\" of the transaction, the data gas paid (data gas * blobs in txn * data gas fee for the block) is included there but not reported in the receipt so there's no simple way to derive a total balance change/state transition for the sending account based on just the transaction and transaction receipt now , unless I'm not thinking clearly here.  I don't know that it's mission critical for 4844 but seems like a missing data point that takes a fair amount of legwork to identify",
