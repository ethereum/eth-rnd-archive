Capella isn't fully implemented in prysm and there's some missing functionality needed for the rebase. So I'm implementing them myself, which is taking a bit of time. I'll be done by EOD tomorrow.\nNext step for me is to merge the changes to Terence's 4844 branch.\nA note: Very nice to see some 4844 stuff (https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/11596) upstreamed to prysm.",

Thanks to everyone that participated.\n\nRe Capella on 4844: We should work towards the Capella rebase PR for devnet-3 rather than wait for Danny's changes to the capella beacon state. At least, assuming we don't the the beacon state updates aren't decided on Thursday's consensus call. This is so devnet-3 implementooors have a spec they can work towards today. (Or could we disable 4844 pyspec tests in the PR and merge it in, so Ryan's PR can be merged later without CI? \u003c@415109946682769408\u003e)\nFrom the pov of a devnet-3 implementooor, Danny's proposed changes to the beacon state are minimal because we'll be stubbing out all withdrawals functionality. Even if we later decide to use the updated beacon state for devnet-3, it shouldn't be difficult for implementooors to make changes.\nThe whole reason why we want devnet-3 to include Capella is so clients can easily implement 4844 on top of the current work on capella.",
