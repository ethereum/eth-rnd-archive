We do validate all 3 following the EIP when we get a serialized one gossiped in the mempool but don't do so for local transactions received from RPC and the EIP doesn't specifiy anything here unless I'm missing it. In theory, the EL client could just require the blobs and then construct the commitments, proofs, and versioned hashes itself but not sure what Geth/Nethermind are doing for this",
