It seems my devnet7 node cannot handle blob tx submission (rpc query works) , while the public rpc endpoint can handle submission but no receipt got (you can find it pending on block Explorer but actually confirmed).  For some reason we need to use our own node to handle blobs, so do you guys have any idea if it is a configuration issue or something else?",
