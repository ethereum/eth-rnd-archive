        "content": "Thanks for the reply, Jimmy. I can rebuild the blob-utils, but it depends on the commit #946a2dae2e9e of lightclient's Geth repo on 8/14.  If  setting the dependency as the latest commit 79f3c2d9c96b of lightclient's Geth devnet-8 branch, the compile will failed because types.NewBlobTxWithBlobs is removed from the repo. And I think the devnet-8 network is based on the latest commit of lightclient's Geth devnet-8 branch.",

The type might have been renamed or moved in latest geth, but if you just want to use the old commit as depenency to send blobs, it should still work. (I've sent blob txs to `devnet-8` using this version of `blob-utils`)",
