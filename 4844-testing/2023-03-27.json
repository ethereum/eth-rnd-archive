Would be helpful to know if tx is in the future and if it is not DL it at the moment.",

It might be a problem if the malicious peer would convince us not to pull the tx at all. although we would need to make our hash cache smart and keep also sender/nonce there, so if other peer announces same tx hash with different sender/nonce we would DL it.\n\nSo overall doable but implementation is complicated. Very flexible though",
