I have recently joined Blossom Labs and will be working on the infrastructure/devops side of Blobscan, the EIP-4844 blobs explorer.\n\nMy current task is setting up a node and reestablishing the connection to the eip4844 devnet. If I got it correctly, it worked fine until devnet-3. So far I have checked out the 4844 testnet repositories but can't get geth+lighthouse working and synced for different reasons, probably misconfiguration. Do you have any guide or repository that I can use to setup a minimal devnet-4 node?",
