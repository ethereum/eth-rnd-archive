It starts post-merge, and spawns a few lighthouse and geth pairs via a bunch of bash scripts. \n\nI’m interested in trying out any other EL’s that are ready (I think nethermind said they were ready on the last call?).\n\nWe’ll be working on porting this over to the interop repo so we can more easily test with other clients. On the last 4844 call it sounded like we wanted the interop repo to start post-merge ? If people are ok with that I’m happy to help work on that as well",
