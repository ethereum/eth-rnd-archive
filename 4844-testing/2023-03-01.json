This means you won’t be able to sync from genesis in the scenario where the chain hasn’t finalized in more than` MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_BLOBS_SIDECARS_REQUESTS `so the way to recover would be to weak subjectivity sync from somewhere within the data availability period and consider all blocks in this chain available",

        "content": "Thanks for the extra context. My concern is exactly the same as dapplion, syncing from genesis. Same would apply to backfilled blocks in a checkpoint synced node. However I just realized that this line in `on_block`  already precluded processing older finalized blocks in the manner specified by on_block in previous versions of the spec:\n```\nfinalized_slot = compute_start_slot_at_epoch(store.finalized_checkpoint.epoch)\nassert block.slot \u003e finalized_slot\n```\nSo I guess genesis sync and backfill are already left as an exercise for the reader (which explains why your comment assumes this is only an issue for periods of non-finality \u003e `MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_BLOBS_SIDECARS_REQUESTS`).",
