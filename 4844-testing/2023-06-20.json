I was wondering though if there is  a test where there is a post-4844 fork header test where the `dataGasUsed` field is undefined (there are some at the ShanghaiToCancunAtTime15k tests which have headers with `excessDataGas` undefined, but I can't seem to find a test where it tests this scenario for the other (so `dataGasUsed`))",
