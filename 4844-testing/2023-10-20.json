Or otherwise, a rough estimate based on recent testing?\n\nAnd perhaps a source on how this impacts the overall TPS? I have the below from Ben Edgington, but it's relatively old! https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p5Q32odNNhK1d8fAXc7O4u7CWiUtYSBuGn9IiemcRa8/edit#slide=id.g1d5931c790e_0_1747\n\nNeed this for \"Impact Metrics\" for Protocol Guild's RPGF 3 application! 😋",
