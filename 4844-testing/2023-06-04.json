Some clients are still on pre devnet 5 designs where it was rlp instead of ssz, then some are on devnet 5 design where we used some ssz, and now devnet 6 is going back to using rlp again. So I would hold off for about a week or so, when we have client releases, that’s when I will also be able to spin a new devnet up.",
