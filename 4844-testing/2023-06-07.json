        "content": "For reference, `math.log2(BLS_MODULUS)` is ~254.86 . That's ~31.86 bytes. The simplest solution would be to just encode 31 bytes of data into each field element, but that's only 97.3% efficiency. I believe Offchain Labs is currently looking at encoding 254 bits of data into each field element, which is 99.7% efficiency. You could theoretically encode even more data than that into each field element, but that complexity might not be worth the extra 0.3% of efficiency.",
