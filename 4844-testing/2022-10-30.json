Otherwise, the decoder cannot know which fields to skip as that info isn't in the codec.\n\nThis shouldn't be a problem post-fork because the \"optional\" capella and 4844 headers must be included anyways. So I'm not sure this is a bug per se, just a known limitation with using rlp for optional fields.",
