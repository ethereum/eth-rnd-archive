This proposal's solution to the shared storage problem has concerns of their own. Nonces are predicable and a malicious delegation can still target the entire storage space. The ability to brick an EOA seems like a non-starter.\n\n7702 was originally proposed in a way that did not require new opcodes, this proposal is doing the thing we wanted to avoid.",
