        "content": "I agree.  imo there's no need to discuss my old proposal and I'd rather focus on 5806:\n- It's cleaner than my old 3074-alternative proposal while providing the same benefits.\n- It doesn't \"change the rules\" (unlike 3074).  The user remains in control, signs every transaction instead of a potentially-perpetual auth.\n- Intuitive for users (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) - like running a script in the EOA now, rather than authorizing a script to always have access to the EOA.\n- Has the best UX for the most desired use case - batching:\n  - No need to sign the batch twice.  Only sign the transaction (as opposed to signing both an EOA transaction and an AUTH to a batching invoker).\n  - Smaller calldata. Only one signature (like any EOA transaction), and no \"commit\".  Cheaper on rollups.\n\nAnother thing I think we all agree on, is that some form of EOA batching is needed, sooner rather than later.  Our opinion may differ on whether the right way is 5806, 3074, or some other batching method, but clearly some method is needed.",
