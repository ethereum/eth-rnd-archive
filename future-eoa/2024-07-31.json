I can make it clearer we're discussing gas though\n\n\u003e Authorizations are not rolled back for aborted transaction, so abort in this case also wouldn't roll back previous authorizations in the list (I guess it's fine or at least consistent)\nThis makes sense to me since there is nothing conditional about an authorization. If it is included, it's included. Only the execution can be conditional\n\n\u003e This changes the guarantee that valid transactions will not fail with not enough sender balance - i.e. extra balance check is required when transferring value\ncould you expand on this? i don't think i understand",
