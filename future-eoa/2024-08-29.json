For recipients with code (`EXTCODESIZE != 0`) `safeTransfer` calls back to the recipient with `onERC721Received` and expects a certain magic value to be returned, otherwise reverts the transfer. Code size is checked because EOAs are assumed to always be able to interact with the token.\n\nEIP-7702 introduces a case of recipients with EXTCODESIZE != 0, which do not respond to `onERC721Received`, but are valid because they are an EOA. Is this a concern?",
