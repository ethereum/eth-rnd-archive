        "content": "Had a relatively elegant idea for gas estimation for `AUTHCALL`s. Basically, the user could one time sign a special dry-run `commit`. The invoker could then expose an alternative dry-run execution path that mirrors the behavior of the main one, but using the special `commit`. It would then crucially revert at the end of execution, returning gas consumption information as part of the revert message. That way it would be easy to iteratively find the required gas for each `AUTHCALL`, as well as the (approximate) overhead of the invoker execution, and only then have the user sign the actual `commit`.",
