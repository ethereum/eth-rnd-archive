        "content": "I'm thinking through how one would standardize efficient consumable recipient addresses for use in ZK account abstraction.\n\nIn my conception of this, one would provide a sender a predictable address, which forms a commitment for a contract whose init code acts as nothing more than a proof verifier that sends its balance to a specified address when a valid proof is provided.\n\nSo a recipient would take the standard init code for this contract, and would hash it with other predictable CREATE(/2) parameters in order to generate the address which such a contract *would* be deployed to, but doesn't deploy it.\n\nThey provide that address to a sender, who sends ETH/tokens to the uninitialized address. The recipient can then later execute (or have a third party execute) the CREATE op + consume call.",
