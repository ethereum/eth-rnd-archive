        "content": "The Gnosis Safe does something similar in having a designated reverting path for gas estimation. It sounds like the extra step would be allowing a dummy commit to approximate the same behavior as a future commit, but having at least an initial solution for this at the smart contract level does seem preferable. https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/39b69e21bb72a037341fe2ac799727d0ce00b011/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol#L284-L304",
