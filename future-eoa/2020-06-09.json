They can also charge a small premium on all txs to cover their losses for wrong prediction, stop servicing users that to bad relays, blacklist of some type of transactions, etc. Lots of options relayers can explore.",

Relayer is the one that has to make sure the txs won't fail or cost too much\n\nI am in camp B) because I believe relayers should be the ones doing all the checks to make sure the tx will go through and the prices are correct, not the user.With B), relayers are incentivized to be \"perfect\" at predicting. With A) relayers aren't incentivized to do that and could be incentivized to make txs fail. In general, I believe B will provide better services for users and users will tend to go for solutions that are like B and not A. \n\nTime will tell 🙂",
