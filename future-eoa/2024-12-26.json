        "content": "4337 works as you described. The reason we need the validation restrictions (erc-7562) is that 4337 fully abstracts validation so we need to ensure that a single state change can't invalidate many transactions at once.  We try to keep the invariant that N invalidations cost the attacker O(n) state changes.  By restricting storage access to slots associated with the account, and limiting the number of pending UserOps per account, we satisfy this requirement.  But in 7702 it can be satisfied without the 7562 rules because 7702 doesn't abstract validation.  The only way to invalidate one account's transaction from another is to withdraw the eth.  The eth balance is associated with the account so the attack requires a state change per account, keeping the O(n) requirement.  Therefore it's enough to ensure that there's only one such transaction in the mempool for each EOA that has 7702 code.",
