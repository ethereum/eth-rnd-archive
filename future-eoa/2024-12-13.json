I posted on this thread https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7702-set-eoa-account-code/19923/327, though the discussion got a little philosophical and I haven't gotten any feedback as to the efficacy of the proposed change or from people who wanted this feature previously but were convinced its no longer desirable, which is the type of feedback I'd be most interested in. thanks to matt for discussing there at all, though",
