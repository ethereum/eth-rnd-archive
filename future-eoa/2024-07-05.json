We were thinking about it internally and this approach actually could allow more flexible approaches. This could be done by persisting the code_hash that has been authorized (instead of an address). The address then has to be provided in the transaction. This would for example allow that you can create a trustless approach for a singleton factory (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2470) that can be reused across chains without having to trust that the code was deployed to the same address. This would also improve security that the code changes in an unexpected way (i.e. metamorphosis of contracts).",
