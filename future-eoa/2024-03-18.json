        "content": "I would argue that this is even worse. Because the users can make delegate calls to any number of smart contracts, so you will eventually have storage collisions. E.g. smart contract A is writing to slot 0 and smart contract B is reading from it, but is expecting a completely different value. It could also be a problem in the future, because should we eventually have a way of upgrading a EOA to a smart contract wallet the storage of the EOA might contain random values from previous delegate calls, which might cause problems.\n\nI like that 5806 is simple and would solve some of the UX issues like batching. But I think the tradeoffs in DX and inconsistencies how smart contracts are executed are too big.",
