I am starting up on State Expiry work, and am currently working on estimating the effort required so that a team can be constituted inside ConsenSys to work. \n\nI understand that the part 1, the Period 1 Hard fork, is largely development effort with some scope of research in algorithmic design in terms of optimisations. I see that there is already Python, Go and Rust implementations of Verkle trees. It would be a great help if people can let me know about the implementation efforts of these Python, Go and Rust implementations. \n\nI understand the work items to be:\n1. Implementing KZG polynomial commits\n2. Implementing algorithms for building a Verkle tree, for inserting new data, for membership witness generation, and for nonmembership witness generation.\n3. Code chunking\n\nAppreciate your help in advance.",
