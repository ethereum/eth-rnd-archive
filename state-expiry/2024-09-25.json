They only contain 1 blocks worth of state and the file names are `{network}-{block number}-{state root}.e2ss`. With the help of Paul from Devops we have set up a s3 bucket storing some dumps \u003chttps://e2ss.ethportal.net/index.html\u003e. Here is a implementation and outline of the format \u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/trin/blob/62dd518a88eda8496f89db9f9c149231a2c326dc/e2store/src/era2.rs\u003e",
