        "content": "Listening to the ASE call, I have a question: How important is it that we allow legacy contracts to be able to interact with long addresses? It seems that a really simple approach without all the complexities would be to just disallow legacy contracts from touching accounts with long addresses. The drawback is of course that it would be more and more expensive to interact with legacy contracts when we start expiring state, until the legacy contract upgrades.",
