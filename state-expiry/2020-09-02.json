We're focusing on keeping the resource requirements for network participation low so that it is very easy to participate in a way that improves overall health of the network, even on very low resource devices.  Interaction at a very high level is 1) allocating a bit of memory/storage and upon encountering content that is \"near you\" in the network, storing it and making it available to anyone who asks for it.  2) looking up and retrieving whatever data you need.  3) being part of the DHT by maintaining a routing table and responding to relevant queries",

There is some level of benevolence out there and as long as the cost and complexity of healthy participation is sufficiently low, you can expect network participants to behave in a way that positively benefits the network.  Especially if they are also getting something out of it like the ability to expose most of the JSON-RPC API without needing an actual ethereum client.",
