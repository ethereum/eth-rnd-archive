Do you (i) need to provide both a witness for epoch N-2 and a witness for epoch N-1 to prove no subsequent change, or (ii) is there some crazy merge process when epoch N-1 ends that combines together the two states, or (iii) something else?\nAnother question: are accounts that are in the inactive state (i) required to be part of an access list, or (ii) could tx execution unexpectedly trigger a requirement to access some particular account that has not been modifed in a long time?\nIf the answers are (i) and (i), then this is remarkably similar to rent models from 1-2 years ago 😛\nExcept I guess with discrete epochs instead of continuous",
