In some ways, ReGenesis borrows the idea from semi-stateless mode (where thee node need to been some amount of \"recent\" state), but what always troubled me is that the definition of what is \"recent\" could be quite complex. In ReGenesis (compared to semi-stateless Ethereum), the cost of complex eviction policy is even higher - because it affects the transaction senders (they need to figure out what witnesses to produce), therefore the policy needs to be visible and straightforward to understand. Removing all state at regular, predictable times is one the simplest possible policies I think",
