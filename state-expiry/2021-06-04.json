It seems to open up a lot of questions. First we have created a hopefully more comprehensive specification based on the forum and explored questions (they are listed in the latter part of the document): https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/H1Aw2ES5O\n\nPosting it now in case someone else is working on this too -- it would be nice to collaborate to find answers more quickly. We expect to update this document as we go next week. Any feedback is welcome, but be prepared the content is in flux.\n\nThere are some differences to the description in the forum, which are listed as bullet points. One difference is we removed references to epochs in the document, and just state bytes 1-5 are reserved and must be zero (i.e it would be epoch 0). This is meant to help decoupling this proposal from state expiry in the sense it could be introduced earlier and independently.",
