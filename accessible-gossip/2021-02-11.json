A malicious actor can send N transactions with the same nonce resulting in N transactions that each map randomly onto the key space. Light nodes will gossip them freely, only discarding some  them when the node's radius is large enough to see multiple of them. As they make there way from the edge of the network towards the middle where radius values get larger, more and more will be discarded as the duplicates get detected.",
