Something where nodes can specify their *limits* for gossip and only the nodes with an intrinsic interest in holding the full mempool do so.  Assuming there is such an architecture, it allows the altruistic contributions of a large number of nodes to spread out the responsibility of managing the gossip of the whole pool, significantly lowers the very heavy burden that regular full nodes carry, and still facilitates miners and others interested in the full pool to do their job.",

Such a network doesn't need to care as much about gossip and updating proofs",
