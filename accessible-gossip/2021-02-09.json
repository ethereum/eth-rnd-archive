That radius can then be used by an individual node as a control flow mechanism.  The radius can also be used to help establish the network topology with nodes individually prioritizing connections that give them full coverage of the address space.  I think it also works out that nodes end up prioritizing connections to nodes that have a similar (or greater) radius.  A node's radius *should* also be externally measurable allowing the network to self police against nodes that publish a fraudulent radius.\n\nRough experiment is to simulate this kind of network and verify that bad actors can be detected, that transactions get efficiently gossiped, and to generate actualy graphs of the emergent network topology under different approaches for managing peer connections.",
