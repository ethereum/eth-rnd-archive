But in the current spec we cache the non signed InclusionList objects: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/85e6451072531b6bc00a66e301f0636711f2886c/specs/_features/eip7805/fork-choice.md?plain=1#L196. I'm thinking we could cache the SignedInclusionList objects instead and serve the RPC requests from the store. Any thoughts about that?",
