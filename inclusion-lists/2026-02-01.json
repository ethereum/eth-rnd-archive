    "content": "Hey there! \n\nSupporting FOCIL is something we’ll absolutely be implementing. You highlight an important consideration of how we aggregate the lists from across the nodes. Qbft or some sort of deterministic packing algorithm may make sense. \n\n> FOCIL’s current design assumes single signer\n\nThat’s normally okay with dvt, so long as what is being signed uses a validators index rather than its public key. I haven’t had a chance to look at the FOCIL spec too closely, but good to keep an eye on for us before it gets solidified.\n\nYou can keep an eye or get more involved in the process over on our discord 🙂 https://discord.obol.org",
