As I understand this can work on some heuristics and differ in implementation per client - but what would be your recommendation?\n\nI find two possibilities:\n- simple one - just add most profitable mem-pool transactions, to make sure they are not censored\n- monitor last X blocks and find transactions in mem-pool that should have been included based on fees, but weren't",

My concerns are that, if we go for something like this, then ePBS\\ET could change the context that IL design will be affected. Moreover, recent mainnet issues with block production and relay made me feel we should prioritize the CL-EL block separation, which will set a more solid base to build IL on top of.",
