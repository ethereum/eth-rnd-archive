Just wanted to mention that Lighthouse is finally interoping succesfully with other clients \n\nThe relevant lighthouse branch can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/eserilev/lighthouse/tree/electra-focil-branch\n\nand the kurtosis config I was using\n\n\n```\nparticipants:\n  - el_type: geth\n    el_image: jihoonsg/geth-focil:9f03028\n    cl_type: lighthouse\n    cl_image: eserilev/lighthouse:focil\n    cl_log_level: info\n  - el_type: geth\n    el_image: jihoonsg/geth-focil:9f03028\n    cl_type: prysm\n    cl_image: jihoonsg/prysm-beacon-chain-focil:9d26fe2\n    vc_type: prysm\n    vc_image: jihoonsg/prysm-validator-focil:9d26fe2\n  - el_type: geth\n    el_image: jihoonsg/geth-focil:9f03028\n    cl_type: lodestar\n    cl_image: ethpandaops/lodestar:focil\n  - el_type: geth\n    el_image: jihoonsg/geth-focil:9f03028\n    cl_type: teku\n    cl_image: ethpandaops/teku:focil\nnetwork_params:\n  genesis_delay: 60\n  electra_fork_epoch: 0\n  eip7805_fork_epoch: 1\n  num_validator_keys_per_node: 256\nadditional_services:\n  - dora\n  - prometheus_grafana\n  - tx_fuzz\n```\n\n\nSorry it took so long, took me much longer than I thought to debug a few issues. Thanks \u003c@845691100072509460\u003e for reviewing the branch and flagging a few issues\n\nUnfortunately I wont be at interop this week but will be online and in a similar timezone if anything comes up!\n\nThere are probably still a few small bugs in lighthouse wrt to focil, ill be working over the next few days to get any additional kinks out",
