I guess it's also worth pointing out that a larger IL gas limit size isn't the same as a gas limit increase in almost every sense - since every tx in the IL will be executed anyway as part of the normal part of block N or block N+1 there's no increase in state, history, or execution throughput. There may be some increase in network bandwidth depending how it's implemented. So I would still argue for maximum flexibility by giving the IL the full gas limit, but understand there may be other reasons (like bandwidth) for wishing to choose something lower.",

One can observe a clear correlation between block size in bytes and the reorg probability (with blocks ranging between 0.1 - 0.6MB) on mainnet already. Also, one cannot really compress the plain transactions in the side car much more, at least not without introducing some new compression that replaces snappy. The worst case scenario would be including 1 big 2.8 MB (already compressed) transaction and also putting it on the IL. (re @InclusionList_bot: \u003cpintail_xyz\u003e I'm interested to know how significant the reorg impact is. But for me censorship resistance is one of the most important properties, and the hardest to achieve, so I would prefer the strongest possible system be implemented)",
