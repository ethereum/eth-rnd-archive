I guess it's also worth pointing out that a larger IL gas limit size isn't the same as a gas limit increase in almost every sense - since every tx in the IL will be executed anyway as part of the normal part of block N or block N+1 there's no increase in state, history, or execution throughput. There may be some increase in network bandwidth depending how it's implemented. So I would still argue for maximum flexibility by giving the IL the full gas limit, but understand there may be other reasons (like bandwidth) for wishing to choose something lower.",

One can observe a clear correlation between block size in bytes and the reorg probability (with blocks ranging between 0.1 - 0.6MB) on mainnet already. Also, one cannot really compress the plain transactions in the side car much more, at least not without introducing some new compression that replaces snappy. The worst case scenario would be including 1 big 2.8 MB (already compressed) transaction and also putting it on the IL. (re @InclusionList_bot: \u003cpintail_xyz\u003e I'm interested to know how significant the reorg impact is. But for me censorship resistance is one of the most important properties, and the hardest to achieve, so I would prefer the strongest possible system be implemented)",

In the middle of demand spikes where the basefee is too low there will be brief period where there may be a premium for guaranteed inclusion in the N or N+1 block. But since all the IL gives you is inclusion in one of two blocks, and not any guaranteed ordering, there is no stat arb, front running, back running, sandwiching or liquidations or really any of the sources of MEV that make block building so valuable. I really don't see any value in complex strategies here - it just briefly degenerates into a first price auction, which is already what happens.",

They shouldn't have to identify possibly-censored transactions in order to include them, an honestly acting proposer should be able to include all valid transactions from the mempool. It's all very well to suggest a half-way system as a starting point but of course that can become a Schelling point and then we get stuck with much less effective censorship resistance.
