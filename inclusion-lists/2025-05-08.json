Maybe this doesn't make much of a difference when thinking of ePBS x FOCIL since there's already a new modified fork-choice rule, but for delayed execution, it was not really considered because of fork choice complexities that come from potentially keeping invalid blocks in the store.\nI still think the bitlist solution, with the lists in the block, is way cleaner and simpler here.",
