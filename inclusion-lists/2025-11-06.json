I figured since you already worked out the Beacon API you'll be better than me for the Engine API. I'd like to add a boolean in the return of `engine_notifyNewPayload` in Glamsterdam. The idea is that the engine would use whatever heuristic they decide to inform the CL that the payload is valid but it's censoring. This anyway needs to be part of FOCIL, so if this has already been done in FOCIL (cc \u003c@845691100072509460\u003e ) then we can probably copy this design. FOCIL makes it part of the protocol how to reply to this boolean, while this that I am proposing is to keep it completely unspecified, both in how the EL sets the boolean and how the CL reacts to it",

        "content": "If I understood you correctly, FOCIL doesn't have this capability and I'm not sure if this is within the FOCIL's scope. In FOCIL, when `engine_newPayload` is called, the EL checks if all valid IL transactions are included in the payload, but not beyond that; it doesn't check if the given payload is censoring based on whichever algorithm they use. IMO, adding that boolean implies quite a semantic change to FOCIL. I'd like to see rough consensus on that modification before making the change.",
