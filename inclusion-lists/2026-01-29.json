        "content": "Hey everyone! \nGreetings of the Day ! Sharing a technical proposal for FOCIL + DVT integration that addresses a critical gap in the current specification.\nProblem: FOCIL's current design assumes single-signer validators, effectively excluding DVT clusters  from inclusion list committees. This undermines FOCIL's censorship resistance goals.\nProposed Solution- Extend Charon middleware with QBFT consensus for threshold-signed ILs. beacon nodes construct ILs from their ELs, Charon runs consensus on complete ILs (not individual transactions). Im sharing My doc Sharing a technical proposal for FOCIL DVT integration - addresses how distributed validators can participate in inclusion list committees. Looking forward to your comments \u0026 review and discussion on the approach -  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqCHVz0VcYky1PcsXhI_AWRcQxBL7vOwCds9IgB1zoI/edit?usp=sharing",
