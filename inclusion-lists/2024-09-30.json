I think it makes sense, even though it's unfortunate, to exclude blob transactions in order to avoid making local block building (under peedDAS) more difficult. The downside is, if a rollup’s blobs are censored, the rollup would have to revert to calldata.\n\n2. Having a delta of 0 and a deadline when the network \"freezes\" their view of local ILs feels problematic. Local ILs could cause attesters to have split views, complicating fork-choice. In this case, the attesters would need a more relaxed function to validate whether the block is valid.",
