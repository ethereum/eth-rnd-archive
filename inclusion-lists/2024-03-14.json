If proposers have to monitor the mempool proactively to identify censored transactions then they are less likely to do so. If the rule is just \"commit all the transactions you see\" then that is much easier to follow. In practice builders still retain almost all control and the only practical difference is that transactions that they would have left out get force-included. I accept there will be some bandwidth cost for any IL but I wonder if there are options to minimise the impact while still allowing for the most powerful CR that we can (as Mike had already referenced, the earlier proposal to address the \"no free DA\" problem might help here)",

        "content": "I expanded on my points. \n\n**Improved Pipelining**\nThe period between seconds 2 and 4 is considered the busiest and most critical for a node to verify, process a block, and determine the head. We should avoid any additional processing during this time at all costs. Separating IL enables a proposer to broadcast IL at the 11-second mark of the previous slot, allowing for the processing of IL between seconds 0-1 or 0-2, and possibly even 10-12 in the previous slot.\n\n**Lighter Block**\nA block without IL will be lighter to handle, resulting in less bandwidth spikes and faster dissemination across the p2p network.\n\n**No Beacon Block Gossip Changes**\nIf the beacon block gossips together with IL, we would need to modify the block gossip validation steps or even libp2p to accommodate scenarios where the same block could have multiple ILs for different peers. This introduces unnecessary complexity.\n\n**No Builder API Changes**\nIf the beacon block gossips together with IL, validators would need to send the IL to the relayer either during the `getHeader` or `getPayload` phase. This adds complexity, and ideally, we want the relayer to have fewer tasks, not more.",
