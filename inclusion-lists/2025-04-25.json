The goal is to compare the inclusion list with actual block contents and visualize the transactions that were mandatorily included by the proposer.\n\nAs part of this, I’m reaching out to check whether there has been any implementation of the engine_getInclusionList endpoint on any client. Specifically:\n\n    Has a PR been opened or merged for this endpoint?\n\n    If yes, could you share the PR link or branch name?\n\n    Are there any available testnet/devnet RPC URLs where this implementation can be tested?",
