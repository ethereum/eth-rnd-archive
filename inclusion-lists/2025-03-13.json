I said I've found a buggy case that a slot with non-empty ILs had an empty block, but this turned out to be a bug in the Dora's IL implementation. Dora should have fetched ILs from previous slot but it was fetching from the same slot. Now it looks like this but it needs some performance optimization. I'll be working on Electra genesis and compatibility issue with Lighthouse and get back to Dora.",
