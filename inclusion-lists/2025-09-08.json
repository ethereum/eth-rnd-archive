        "content": "Not really. I was told ethereum-package supports Gloas genesis so just wanted to try it out. I haven't checked if Lodestar supports Gloas genesis fork today, which might be a reason of your issue. Only Lighthouse (`jihoonsg/lighthouse-focil:92c22ed`) and Geth (`jihoonsg/geth-focil:dffb273`) worked. Lighthouse didn't produce ILs after the transition from Gloas to eip7805 fork but this is fine as we were based on Electra and are now rebasing onto Fulu and then Gloas.\n\nIt will take some time as not all clients support Gloas genesis fork yet and people are busy with Fusaka at the moment. If I were to work on Reth, I would make it work with Electra ones first. Currently, some clients don't work as it's stale, so I prepared a new Kurtosis config that works on Electra for you. It runs with Lighthouse and Geth pair, so you could add Lighthouse and Reth pair to see if works.\n\nYou could use this config: https://github.com/jihoonsong/local-devnet-focil/blob/main/kurtosis/kurtosis.config.electra.yaml\n\n(Building a multiplatform image for Lighthouse in my machine takes forever. If you're not on arm64, you can build a Docker image based on this repo: https://github.com/jihoonsong/lighthouse/tree/electra-focil-branch)",
