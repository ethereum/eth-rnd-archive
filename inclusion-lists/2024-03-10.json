Otherwise which% of the val set will use them\n- what's the risk of ILs devolving into a IL-boost market? Again what percent of the val set would use them properly in that case? \n- based on the answers above, what's the delta in blocks with non censoring block space compared to today will ocasional self building (re @mikeneuder: howdy :D wrote up a very short doc called “The case for ILECTRA” https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/the-case-for-ilectra\n\nwould love any comments!)",

        "content": "\u003cnero_eth\u003e Great doc, I left a few comments.\nI personally like the phrasing of ILs as an extension to PBS that re-balances the incentives for non-censoring vs. censoring parties. Currently, if I don't want to participate in censorship, I must do local block building. With ILs, I can finally make MEV profits without worsening censorship. Thus, it's basically improving the status quo for non-mevboost users, finally putting them into a adequate position in terms of profitability.
