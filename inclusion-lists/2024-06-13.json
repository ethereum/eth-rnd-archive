With timing constraints, each node already has less than 1 second to process a block. Latency comes from two places:\n\n1. Block proposal: As a proposer, I have to parse the attestations to get the transactions. How does this work with MEV-Boost and builders? Will they be forced to use local blocks?\n\n2. Block processing: Parsing through attestations to get the transactions and penalizing a censoring block is a cross layer action, takes longer and will require additional engine API calls to accomplish this.",
