        "content": "Thanks for the feedback! Using `ExecutionEngine` constant inside `is_inclusion_list_satisfied(store: Store, block_root: Root) -\u003e bool` sounds good. I think this approach better aligns with the spec.\n\nWhat would be the signature of `on_inclusion_list` in your mind? Based on the suggested test vectors covering IL equivocation, I assume it's `def on_inclusion_list(store: Store, signed_inclusion_list: SignedInclusionList) -\u003e None` in option 3 that calls `store_inclusion_list(store: InclusionListStore, inclusion_list: InclusionList, is_before_view_freeze_deadline: bool) -\u003e None`?",
