        "content": "Hi, curious to know what's our take regarding the hand-off problem and that a state contention based censorship would be still possible with FOCIL (censoring a transaction desired output and not the transaction itself)? Has that been discussed or is it being researched for future enhancments somewhere? I came across this article https://blog.init4.technology/p/the-hand-off-problem and I would like to have any feedback or thoughts. IMU FOCIL doesn't aim to solve \"all\" censorship issues but is rather a first step toward it (it is helpful for any simple or non-defi transaction), plus, combined with ePBS, I guess we could end up with a fairly nice censorship resistance level",
