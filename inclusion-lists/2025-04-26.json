        "content": "The desired outcome is a slot-by-slot comparison of transactions in ILs and in the block. So you want to know the ILs proposed by IL committee members per slot. To that end, you could use [beacon API](https://github.com/ensi321/beacon-APIs/blob/focil/apis/eventstream/index.yaml#L156-L160) that emits an event whenever a valid IL is received. All CL clients (Prysm, Lodestar, Teku and Lighthouse) have implemented this and Dora uses it to show ILs per slot.\n\n`engine_getInclusionList` will give you an IL which is a separate one from those ILs produced by IL commitee members and hence it's likely to have different content.\n\nYou can use this [Kurtosis config](https://github.com/jihoonsong/local-devnet-focil/blob/fafd0463b19e80318ad4b156ec1b723f5cb17422/kurtosis/kurtosis.config.registry.interop.yaml) to run a local devnet of Prysm, Lodestar and Teku, which of each is paired with Geth.",
