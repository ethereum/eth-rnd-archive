        "content": "Anyway, I'm truly stupid for mixing the times, but here's a TL;DR of what I wanted to say. \n\nThe cons: \n- both EIPs interact, that makes testing more complicated cause they can't be tested in isolation\n- FOCIL is a little bit worse since the payload IL satisfaction is not checked until the next slot. \n- FOCIL is a little bit worse in that the payload arrives later, so IL committee members have less time to include txs. \n\nThe pros:\n- ePBS has no changes whatsoever in its good properties: timeliness for execution and propagation of blobs/blocks is still several times the current times. \n- FOCIL complications mentioned above are really minor: attesters of slot N optimistically vote for the IL satisfaction before seeing the payload. The proposer of N+1 can simply reorg the payload if it didn´t  satisfy it, attesters of N+1 enforce that the payload is reorged if it didn't satisfy the IL. \n\nThe mechanism (here's where \u003c@917367578966523934\u003e's post is relevant):\n\nThe only change is minor, the builder includes in the bid a bitlist of which committee members' ILs are included. Attesters see this bid early in their CL block, so they attest only if those bits are consistent with their view. That is, if the payload doesn't even promise to satisfy an IL, the attesters will not even vote for a CL block that commits to that payload. Later when the payload is revealed, the proposer of the next slot enforces that the IL that was promissed is actually satisfied. The attesters of the next slot will support the proposer's decision. \n\nIn short: simply including the bitlist in the bid is all the change",

These two concepts are applied in the ePBS setting for the attesters of block n.\n\nOptimistic attestations seem particularly suitable for ePBS with ABBs, because empty blocks already exist as a concept. In the delayed execution setting, the next proposer must reorg an optimistically attested to block that turns out to be invalid upon execution, and complications follow. In ePBS, the proposer will simply build on the empty block if it turns out that the builder did not adhere to the stipulation in the ABB upon execution, then counting previous attestations as votes for empty.",
