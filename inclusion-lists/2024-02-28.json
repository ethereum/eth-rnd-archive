        "content": "The EL requires  a paradigm change (although I'm told it's not a change in fact) in that you need the previous block (in addition to the current state) to validate the current block. Yeah I'm aware you may already need many of them, but nonetheless. In addition it requires two new endpoints: to validate the IL and to give you a new one. I don't think either is hard, testing across 6 different clients and 30b different combinations may be problematic",
