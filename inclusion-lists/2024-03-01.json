If all blocks are valuable, you completely leave censor resistance to the builders which is a centralized set. ILs are not bullet proof, but are much more effective in guaranteeing inclusion",

We are seeing crazy games played by relays in which they lower the bid offered to the validator to pay back the builder... we are enabling these games... but anyway, this has nothing to do with the topic of this channel",
