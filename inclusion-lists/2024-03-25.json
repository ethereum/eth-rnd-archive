So the current issue is that the IL design is fundamentally not forward compatible with a potential future enshrinement of \"arbitrary validity condition\" AA. and in addition, would require an adjustment either to the IL design or to 3074 to be compatible with that?\n\nIf that's the situation, I am not sure I understand the jump to \"we need to hold off with ILs for now\". To me:\n- ILs are a strong priority\n- they do not create legacy bloat (vs say opcodes that need to be supported forever)\n- it is entirely unclear whether we will ever enshrine AA and in what form (and if so likely still several years away)\n- 3074 compatibility, while a symptom of this general AA issue, is not in itself hard to fix. and 3074 inclusion in prague is far from certain anyway.\n\nTo me these all strongly motivate moving ahead with ILs for Electra, and then potentially move to some IL 2.0 design in the far future where we might actually get serious about enshrined AA (if ever)",
