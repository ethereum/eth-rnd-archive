        "content": "Since we mentioned IL at the epbs breakout, I thought I'd capture it here. In slot auctions, because of the timing game, it may make sense to move the `start` (builder reveal) and `end` (PTC votes) earlier. Moving the `end` earlier makes sense, but what about the `start`? For solo validators, it doesn't matter, and on my local nodes, I can see 50% of attestation votes within an 800ms average, though it uses a lot of bandwidth and is probably not ideal for builders. The question is how early we can push the `start`. Pushing the `start` earlier allows us to push the `end` even earlier, which gives more time to the `IL committee` and `builder` of the subsequent slot. This helps FOCIL, I think.",
