Basically we need IL related endpoints to have IL be type `[]hexutil.Bytes` and not `[][]byte`. Need a way to convert between IL txs hex strings and `[]*types.Transaction`.",

However I think this is a stopgap as it needs to do the conversion when it communicates over the P2P as well, if I'm not wrong. That change seems quite invasive so I left it untouched.",
