        "content": "I have some questions regarding FOCIL https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7805. Sorry if I've completely misunderstood some things. But here are some thoughts:\n\nCurrently the EL has to do this (excerpt)\n\n```\n1. Check whether T is present in B. If T is present, then jump to the next transaction, else continue with next step.\n\n2. Validate T against S.\n\nIf T is invalid, then continue to the next transaction.\n\nIf T is valid, terminate process and assert block B as invalid.\n\n1. Execute T on state S. Assert that the execution of T fails.\n```\n\nI don't understand the last rule. When is this checked? Seems that previously it is checked either T is invalid or T is valid (then the block is invalid). So when is this checked? And why is it checked that the execution of T fails? This still means I have executed my tx, plus I have done a change to the state (bumped nonce of EOA and paid gas). So that means T is valid and thus B is invalid? Even if T fails after executing it?\n\n----\n\nIt seems to me that we do not want to execute the IL txs (only check the validity by nonce/balance). So maybe the final rule should be removed?\n\n---- \n\nThere is a cap on the IL list of 8 KiB, which thus means that txs \u003e 8 KiB can be censored. What does this mean? In order to ensure one cannot get censored, it would thus mean the feature we are trying to use fits in a tx \u003c= 8 KiB?\n\n----\n\nIt is not entirely clear to me (after reading the EIP a few times) how the IL propagation works. Am I correct that: every IL members can send two ILs (this would be then for slot `N` and slot `N+1`), but these ILs cannot be different (except slot number (?)). So therefore it is possible that the IL lives for block `B` but also for block `B + 1`?\n\nI can see how this makes censorship harder, but a block builder could simply ensure that IL rules are satisfied by just ensuring that the block is full by sending a tx with the gasLimit the current gasLeft of the block and then triggering an INVALID (burning all gas)",

If they send 2, it means they have equivocated. The 2 ILs must then still be propagated, to ensure that everyone is aware of the equivocation, such that both ILs can be ignored.",
