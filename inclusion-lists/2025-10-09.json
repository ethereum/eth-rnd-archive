We can monitor Engine API values on the CL side. Like unsatisfied blocks, sent/received transactions, etc. These APIs are quite robust. It means if the request succeeded, we will get the same number of txns on EL that were sent from CL. If not, we will catch the request failures on the CL side. It makes sense to monitor only EL specific metrics like validation failures, gas related metrics, etc. Let us know if you have any other concerns on this. If anyone disagrees, please, speak up.",
