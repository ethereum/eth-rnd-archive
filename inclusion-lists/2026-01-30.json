The main challenge is DVT node consensus when mempools diverge.\nOur proposed approach: Leader-based QBFT where one node's IL becomes canonical if 2/3+ can validate it (vs. per-transaction voting which risks undersized ILs). Would be great to get CL implementer input on- Does this endpoint pattern (/eth/v1/validator/inclusion_list) fit Validator API conventions? Timing; IL at 3/4 slot = ~9s window. QBFT adds ~200-500ms. Feasible? Any concerns exposing mempool derived data via Validator API? Looking forward to it",
