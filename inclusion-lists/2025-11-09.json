I mean similar thing today when you pass a payload to EL to verify by calling engine_newPayload, you need to trust your EL saying whether this payload is valid or not.",

You can always verify source code and build from source if concerned.",

For example sending txs so that the EL responds with yes when a specific builder has won the auction. So the heuristic shouldn't be stupid enough. Having multiple heuristics varying by client helps to prevent builders gaming them",
