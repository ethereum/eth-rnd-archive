In Teku we didn't add anything fulu related yet and that makes it crash when testing focil with prysm. I tried removing the fulu fork epoch from the kurtosis config but it looks like prysm doesn't like that and stops proposing blocks when we reach the eip7805 fork epoch. Is there a way to skip the fulu fork in prysm?",
