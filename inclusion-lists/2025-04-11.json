        "content": "Few questions regarding the block production workflow since we have the `engine_updatePayloadWithInclusionListV1`. Does that mean that the CL \u003c\u003e EL interaction when we're proposing would now become: `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` (the EL starts preparing the payload and returns a payloadId) -\u003e `engine_updatePayloadWithInclusionListV1` (called at slot - 1s with the payloadId we got and the IL transactions so the EL updates the payload accordingly) -\u003e `engine_getPayload` to retrieve the final execution payload from the EL? Should the `engine_getPayload` be called immediately after the `engine_updatePayloadWithInclusionListV1`? What are the current implementations?",

        "content": "Yes that's the flow how Prysm and Lodestar deal with it. The reason why we have `engine_updatePayloadWithInclusionListV1` is because it's easier to implement and we didn't know if people like overloading payloadAttribute when calling forkchoiceUpdated. After more core devs onboard and if we come to a conclusion that using forkchoiceUpdated is better, it can be changed.\n\nPrysm calls getPayload at 0 seconds into the slot, if I'm not mistaken, so it's one second after `engine_updatePayloadWithInclusionListV1` call. I guess when to call getPayload may vary depending on clients.\n\nIt's a different issue but currently, calling `engine_updatePayloadWithInclusionListV1` immediately after `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` call seems yields mostly empty IL when it shouldn't. I was investigating this few weeks ago but have been working on other commitments so need more time to find out why. In the same vein, I think you should be safe to call getPayload immediately after but maybe Geth complains for some reason, I haven't tried it. If you try it, please let us know if it works.",
