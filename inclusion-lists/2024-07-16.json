It seems to me that checking for IL agg satisfaction requires extremely minimal overhead over payload execution, whereas validation of the p2p ILs can be done statically (against the the pre-state) (re @InclusionList_bot: \u003cpotuz\u003e [reply]: No, I would define it as the fact that validity of the IL creation and satisfaction cannot be determined statically and only at runtime by executing the txs.)",

Now your mempool tells you that you have two transactions, A and B that have the right nonce, balance and gas_limit for the current base fee. Problem is that transaction A invalidates tx B. Either we allow them both in the IL (and then the attesters for the next payload will do the runtime check to realize that B could not have been included in fact) or we execute them now to find out that B cannot be included and therefore we don't put them in the IL.",

One thing that I don't think was mentioned is what happens if an IL member submits an invalid IL.",
