It had a link to the execution-apis, which was a blocker, and it's displaced by another [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9851). Thanks for handling all of this \u003c@348512261955911691\u003e!",

And let's discuss them in Berlin as well.\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/beacon-metrics/pull/16\nI had a version and a dashboard for Prysm, but it's a bit outdated. Need to merge the updates.\n\nAlso, now we have a freshly baked repo for execution metrics specs. \u003c@845691100072509460\u003e and other clients, if you have some ideas for EL metrics, would be great to hear from you. Feel free to open issues and PRs.\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-metrics",
