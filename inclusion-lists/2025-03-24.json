We're rebasing onto Electra to become independent from Fulu changes so I don't think this is right. I'd like to suggest to use eip7805 for the EL as well and want to discuss this in the upcoming FOCIL breakout. I temporarily made Geth's `ForkchoiceUpdatedV3` don't check fork version for testing purpose and it's available at `jihoonsg/geth-focil:no-osaka`.",
