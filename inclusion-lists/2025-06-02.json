I mentioned here a while back that I've been working on [txpool-viz](https://github.com/punkhazardlabs/txpool-viz), a txpool tracking and visualization tool that also lets you visualize block validity based on inclusion lists.\n\nWhile testing locally, I’ve noticed that valid blocks are produced consistently for a period, but then start failing validity checks. I suspect this is related to congestion, timing drift, or resource constraints on my local testnet.\n\nI’d really appreciate help running this on better-resourced infra or localnets to confirm whether the same behavior appears in other environments.\n\nInstall \u0026 Run:\n\nUsing [network_params.yaml](https://github.com/punkhazardlabs/txpool-viz/blob/main/network_params.yaml)\n\n```bash\nkurtosis run --enclave my-testnet github.com/punkhazardlabs/ethereum-package@ndeto/feat/add-txpool-viz --args-file network_params.yaml\n```\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n* Any discrepancies between target block timestamps vs mined block timestamps for transactions\n* General feedback on logs, clarity, config ergonomics, and runtime behavior\n\nOpen to PRs, issues, or direct messages — thanks so much in advance!",
