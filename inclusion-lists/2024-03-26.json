        "content": "~~Ok, so I'll ask the heretic question: how about dropping the condition of balance for inclusion?  how can it be that it is a DoS vector? whomever includes it has already done the simulation and knows how much it can gather from that transaction... or even that builder can simply check for balance before and decide not to include.  I admit I am a complete ignorant here but I fail to see how this causes a DOS. Apologies for taking this channel to learn the basics of execution, I should probably spend the time actually reading the yellow paper, but I feel that many things also may have changed their justification/footing with the move to PoS~~",

Since the nonces in the included summary are not verified, you still need to grab the state prior to appying the parent block to verify them. This is avoidable by Francesco's approach of committing the addresses in the paylaod to the state, but for balances and 3074 this is simply impossible, this is the main observation of the above document",
