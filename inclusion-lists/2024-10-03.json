The IL committee can actually be preconfers even though it's not 100% certain because the proposer can always have a full block, and I don't think it's the same argument to say builders can't know vs IL committee doesn't know, as manually stuffing the block is expensive to do",

By EIP-1559, as long as a transaction pays the base fee, it will be included in the next block (unless it is censored). IL committee members do not improve upon this guarantee (again unless it is censored). As far as I am aware, there are no inclusion preconfirmations live now/big now, presumably because it is not very valuable.",
