Some notes:\n\n- We're lacking the fork choice component, as previously discussed by Francesco and potuz. A leaf fork choice node cannot be considered viable for the head if the IL is unavailable. However, we could import the block into the fork choice store.\n- Regarding gossip block validation, should we be more cautious with cases like (block, IL1) and (block, IL2)? Currently, if they share the same slot and proposer index, they're disregarded. Although importing them might not be the best approach, should we consider re-gossiping to other peers?
