Allowing IL committee members to execute block N-1 before creating ILs that constrain block N.\n2. Ensuring the ILs have sufficient time to propagate to the proposer. 7805 budgets 3 seconds for 16 ILs.\n\nEIP-7782 proposes 6s slots and sets the attestation deadline at 3s. To allow IL committee members to execute the previous block, ILs should only be propagated at, say, second 4.5. That leaves 1.5 seconds to get the ILs to the proposer. I think this is already possible as with 16 IL committee members the total IL size is 1 blob. Currently, we propagate 9 blobs + block in 2-4 seconds. However, if that is deemed unsafe, it would be reasonable to decrease to 8 IL committee members per slot as the number of IL committee members per unit of time from FOCIL then stays the same as in 7805. (16 IL committee members per 12 seconds). Then we have the exact same propagation time assumptions per IL with 6s slots as with 7805.",
