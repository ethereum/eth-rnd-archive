If we aggregate ILs in append-only way rather than map-reduce fashion, it would increase complexity and require more data size.\n\nThis is just an idea but what if:\n1) a block proposer in slot N aggregate ILs and pass it to IL committee in slot N + 1\n2) IL committee in slot N + 1 signs the IL_agg and a block proposer in slot N + 1 aggregates signatures\n3) a builder in slot N + 1 is constrained by the IL_agg",
