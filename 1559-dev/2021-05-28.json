Or did you re-send transactions with the same nonce if stuck? Also, did you ever create transactions with tip \u003e feeCap?",

        "content": "Another important corner case question for the other clients: do you allow a tx in the pool if it can't pay for its own `feeCap`  (`balance \u003c feeCap * gasLimit`) but can pay the current `baseFee + tip`? Geth rejects these, maybe that's another reason it has less pending when the balance starts to run out (I mean if Besu allows them in the pool, of course).",

        "content": "So with my spamming I synchronize the nonce regularly in order to resend with the same nonce if transactions have not been included . And for the tests at the beginning the tip was below feecap but that changed when we used 10 billion for the tip because the range of the feecap was [10 billion, 50 billion]\n\nI tried spamming differently . I do not send transactions directly to the Besu sealer and I spam with two tools in parallel on different accounts that send on two different nodes. This seems to be better and Geth filled the blocks",
