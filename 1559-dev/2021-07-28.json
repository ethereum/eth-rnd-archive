I doubt the actual mechanism will have an issue given that it's been tested extensively, both on our devnets + testnets, on other blockchains, and analyzed economically. There are some known attacks (e.g. 51% of miners drive the base fee down to 0), but it is likely fine to respond to those in hours/days vs. minutes/hours. \n\nI think what is likeliest is an issue in implementations, like we saw on Ropsten, or right after Berlin. So in that case, clients will need to issue a new release ASAP. It probably makes sense for client teams to have someone available for the ~24h after the fork in case something happens.",
