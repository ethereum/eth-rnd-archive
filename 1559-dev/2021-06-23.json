I saw on the latest release that IFF you do not supply `gasLimit` it will default to `1559` but that doesn't seem to be the case, since the following payload is returning a 1559 error:\n```\n# payload - note this is from web3.js internals, this payload is being sent to \"eth_estimateGas\"\n {\n    from: '0x91a37bea41dc245b81b8b85bbdc6729474a6fc2c',\n    data: '0x[...]',\n    gasPrice: '0x1',\n    gas: '0x3d0900'\n  }\n\n# response\nmax fee per gas less than block base fee: address 0x29ecd97a9cd857De3AE434B4f71e54cbb2340866, maxFeePerGas: 1 baseFee: 670622133 (supplied gas 2010499)\n```\nFrom my understanding this should not return an EVM error but instead numerical value (in hex).",
