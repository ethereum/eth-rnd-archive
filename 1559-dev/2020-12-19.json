        "content": "Hi. After reading adietrichs's EIP-1559 txpool documentation, I came up with an algorithm that is faster than naive sorting every block in an EIP-1559 txpool. The fast algorithm can reduce the computational complexity of sorting from `O(n log n)` to `O(k log n)`. `n` is the number of transactions in a txpool, and `k` is the number of transactions where the miner bribe varies with basefee. If the change in basefee is small, then `k` is small compared to `n`.\n\nI've already implemented the prototype in C++. https://github.com/minaminao/eip1559txpool\nAlso, I've tested it with a few parameters in my local environment, and it speeds up transaction selection by a factor of 20-50 without changing fees earned. Is there a need for this algorithm? I heard that Geth sorts transactions every block, so I doubt it is necessary. If there is a demand for this algorithm, I will write a detailed explanation of the algorithm and continue implementing it.",

I implemented the algorithm directly, so I'm writing the description now 🙂 Also, I'm good at algorithms, but I'm not an expert on ethereum clients, so I wanted to proceed based on reactions. \nThe reason I wrote the algorithm in C++ is that it uses self-balancing binary search trees (SBST), but Python does not have SBST in the standard library.",
