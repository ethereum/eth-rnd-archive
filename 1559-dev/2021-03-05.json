        "content": "Hi, is there an implementation guide on 1559 transaction pool? As I understand, by promoting legacy transaction type to 1559 transaction type, we are able to have only one transaction pool. But, instead of sorting the pending transactions list only when new transaction arrives (based on the fact that sorting criteria is gas price), now with 1559 we have to sort the transactions list regardless if new transaction arrived or not (based on the fact that sorting criteria now is miner bribe which is dynamic value which changes with each new block). So, is this new sorting mechanism part of the consensus or every client needs to develop its own logic?",
