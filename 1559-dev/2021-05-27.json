And if feeding a tx library with a `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field will result in the creation of a 1559 tx is likely depending on the implementation.\n\nWith the `@ethereumjs/tx` library you can create a 1559 tx with `FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction.fromTxData()`, this will automatically result in a 1559 tx which you can then use to create the correct serialized tx payload with `tx.serialize()`. See the tx release notes from the link above for a more complete example.\n\nGenerally note that the tx payload format has changed with the introduction of typed txs, for 1559 it is e.g. `0x02 || rlp([chainId, nonce, maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas, gasLimit, to, value, data, access_list, signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS])`, see the respective section in the EIP: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559#abstract\n\nA tx payload now always starts with a first byte for the tx type. So if it is not `0x02` for 1559 tx, you can already see that your payload is malformed.",

I know we have got 1-2 but doesn't want to just throw (half-)publicly in the ring here myself.\n\nWould this be an RPC endpoint we could eventually also add to the baikal spec document https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md and promote in the Ecosystem Developer calls? //cc \u003c@!420951281910284289\u003e \u003c@!552133098075193354\u003e \n\nGuess this would be helpful for ecosystem developers to test their stuff. 🙂",
