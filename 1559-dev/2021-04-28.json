        "content": "Hi guys, I just tried sending EIP1559 txs over TurboGeth/Besu/Nethermind but all of them failed. If I just try to serialize a tx such that it represents the bytes which we use for the transactions trie (so for EIP1559 these bytes start with `0x02`) then nodes do not accept it. However, if I re-RLP the byte sequence (so the one starting with `0x02`) then I get a valid RLP which can be directly decoded and nodes seem to accept this. This, however, breaks some stuff like in web3;\n\n```javascript\nvar Tx = require('ethereumjs-tx').Transaction;\nvar privateKey = Buffer.from('e331b6d69882b4cb4ea581d88e0b604039a3de5967688d3dcffdd2270c0fd109', 'hex');\n\nvar rawTx = {\n  nonce: '0x00',\n  gasPrice: '0x09184e72a000',\n  gasLimit: '0x2710',\n  to: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',\n  value: '0x00',\n  data: '0x7f7465737432000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000600057'\n}\n\nvar tx = new Tx(rawTx, {'chain':'ropsten'});\ntx.sign(privateKey);\n\nvar serializedTx = tx.serialize();\n\n// console.log(serializedTx.toString('hex'));\n// 0xf889808609184e72a00082271094000000000000000000000000000000000000000080a47f74657374320000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006000571ca08a8bbf888cfa37bbf0bb965423625641fc956967b81d12e23709cead01446075a01ce999b56a8a88504be365442ea61239198e23d1fce7d00fcfc5cd3b44b7215f\n\nweb3.eth.sendSignedTransaction('0x' + serializedTx.toString('hex'))\n.on('receipt', console.log);\n```\n\nIf I try to `sendSignedTransaction` for a EIP1559Transaction, then I need to `rlp.encode(serializedTx)` and then send that byte sequence. This is not the case for LegacyTxs. If we want to do this (not really have any opinion yet) then this should be documented. I also find it somewhat weird that we don't \"doubly\" RLP these txs for the transactions trie, but we do \"doubly RLP\" then if we want to send them over RPC, I find this inconsistent.",

(Also a good test case for ethereum/tests \u003c@!393119312350543872\u003e : check if a single txn can get mined in a block which has a higher gas limit than the current gas target, but within bound of ELASTICITY*GasTarget)",
