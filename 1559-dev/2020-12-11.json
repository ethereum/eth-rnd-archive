(I would have expected this one to be more focused on specific questions about code, and the other one to basically be the main discussion...)  Meantime I will post this here, since maybe this channel is more fitting:\n\n It was interesting to learn super briefly how Filecoin transaction (tx) execution happens 1 block after the tx is included in a block... So that definitely has effects on their implementation of 1559.  But how much of an effect? For example, how much of their 1559 mempool implementation could apply to Geth etc when Geth implements 1559?",
