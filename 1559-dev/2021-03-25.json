If we don't, the last three tests in that test set do not make sense to me, as we should never get there (assuming we start mainnet at a basefee of 1E9 of course).\nThis may be less of a \"1559-dev\" question though, and more of a \"1559-fee-market\" question.

It actually contains only one best transaction from each sender. For example, if you have sender A with transactions A1, A2, A3 and sender B with transactions B1, B2, totaling 5 transactions in tx pool, then best_transactions contains only two of them, A1,B1. Then, if you want to print the sorted list of txs in tx pool, you would take the best one from best_transactions (for example B1), remove it from best_transactions, and then insert the next best transaction from that same sender(B) (if exist) into best_transactions (B2). Now it contains A1,B2.  You would iterate like this until no more txs.\nSo, based on this, it is clear why OE need the same structure to handle the worst transactions in a same manner.",
