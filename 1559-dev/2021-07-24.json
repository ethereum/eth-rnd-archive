        "content": "I think I agree with your perspective. The fundamental premise, that the priority fee is a separate matter and should be treated separately feels correct. \n\nIn other words, given that someone is wants to engage in priority gas auction, how to enable expressivity of fee, while protecting from overpaying. As you say, if you plan on auctioning up, it is hard to know where to start with the max fee. Start too high, and your auction ends too early for your preference.\n\nThe requirement that neither parameter is lowered prevents misuse in an every-other-transaction game.\n\n(In my example I was in fact referring to a \"standard wallet\" with max fee at 2x base fee)\n\n(Points 2 \u0026 3 are a suggestion it is unlikely that a priority gas auction participant will not also want to raise the max fee. My point is false if they have already set it to their true maximum)\n\nA practical workaround might be: if engaging in a specialised priority gas auction, set the max fee low-ish. The bot/software you run can increment it too.",

        "content": "Actually, I think I've changed my mind re: replacement txs with only a max fee increase:  It would be nice if they were allowed, but only under very strict conditions: namely,  that the old max fee is less then the current base fee, and the new max fee is greater than base fee + existing miner tip.  That converts the tx from  un-mineable to imminently mineable.   Allowing anything else would open the door for spamming.\n\nI would be curious to hear from some of the devs as to why it is currently set up to require an increase in both values.",

        "content": "It may or may not partially stem from a time where the miner fee was not bound by the max fee. I.e. you could say `maxMinerFee = 1000` and `maxFeeCap = 300` , and never pay more than 300. That's not allowed anymore, but that is a relatively recent addition. Although the tx pool replacement is also relatively new compared to the other parts of EIP-1559.",
