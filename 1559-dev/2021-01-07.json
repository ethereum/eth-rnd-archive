I managed to generate a testnet with 100M accounts and a smart contract with 100M entries in the storage. The problem is that I had to start with a extremely huge gas limit. If we keep this limit for the testing that sucks because we will never reach even 1% of the gas limit and everything will be useless. And we can only decrease the gas limit by 1/1024 from a block to another. So the change would be to disable this validation rule for the test when you will join the testnet. Does that make sense ? Unless you have another idea without changing the implementation but I don't see any.",
