If this value isn't modified we'll end up with half size blocks. Are miners supposed to flip this value to 30M after the fork?",

New formats that work well might then be adopted by other wallets. \n\nOne general idea is: it's likely that the average user won't need to see much, just show them a cost and hide the rest \n\nAnother idea is: the behind-the-scenes formula for the fee is likely programmable. I expect that there will be some good formulas emerge, but the user might not see these. The feeHistory API is probably going to underpin these.",

Perhaps the basefee rises more frequently and for longer than we expect and that multiple needs to be predicted better from the amount of recent 100% used blocks.",
