The supporters constantly note the lowering of fees and deflation, and miners stating the devs are taking their transaction fees.  Both have nothing to do with what the intention of 1559 is.\n\nWith that said, those that started the 51 hour consolidation of hashrate know exactly why they proposed it.  It has been stated multiple times that there is no increased security threat due to 1559.  Scenarios were presented by \u003c@!318272156305981440\u003e showing that there were scenarios where there would be an increased threat with a specific proposal to raise the BR by 1 in order to decrease the possibility in the sudden shift of hashrate away from Ethereum.\n\nLastly, there has been at least one person and I believe more than one from ACD call participants that didn't believe a consolidation of hashrate could occur.  This is a real threat when 1559 goes into effect.  Many miners will move to profit switching miners (NiceHash, for example) which are also rental hashrates as Ehtereum may not be the dominant currency for mining profitability.",

Decision makers don't believe the mining community can organize and don't believe a consolidation of hashrate can be coordinated.  They may be right, but the mining community is taking up the dare and doing it in a way that is nondestructive.  Consolidating at a pool such as Ehtermine, a well respected pool, will not cause a 51% attack.  It will only show that it is possible.",

        "content": "\u003c@604977744044097546\u003e I agree with your first paragraph for sure. 1559 is not to take away income from miners and it is not to lower the fees. It is to make the fees more predicable (which could be argued as a way to lower them a bit if various services did not always need to ‘one up’ one another needlessly to make a transaction pull through. It’s as people say a better UX). I am more so concerned with miners thinking neither the dev community or the users matter. It comes off as pretentious and honestly needlessly aggressive. We’re all equally a piece of the pie. None of it would work with only 2/3 in the mix. I think we can all agree on that. The narrative really needs to change.",
