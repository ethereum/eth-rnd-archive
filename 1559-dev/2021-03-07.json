One very simple method that could satisfy this requirement might be an `eth_getBaseFeeStartBlock()` rpc method, which could return the block (past or present) that the 1559-type fee structure begins, so the wallet/clients could behave accordingly, regardless of whether this is mainnet, Optimism, Rinkeby, or something else.",
