Could you check what transaction do you have in block 14? I decoded one transaction with one ACCESS_LIST_ADDRESS and one ACCESS_LIST_STORAGE. Could you check if the transaction in the 14th block has any access-list? What is more, the 14th block has a gas usage = 21000. Could you confirm the gas usage?",
