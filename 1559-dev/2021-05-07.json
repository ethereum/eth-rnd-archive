        "content": "For us in the JS team that would actually help us a lot if someone could write down at some point how a minimal conceptual tx pool should look like (what txs to keep under what kind of rules, on what sync state to broadcast what kind of txs, reasonable default settings,...).\n\nWe currently don't have a tx pool implemented and only passively join networks and we had so many questions which hold us back to start on an implementation. And I couldn't find a single concise write-up on the topic (which comes at least somewhat close to some sort of specification).\n\nLikely also beneficial for others and for having a reference point on future tx pool behavior discussions.",
