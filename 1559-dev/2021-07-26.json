Ethers validates a transaction response makes sense, which has historically meant that gasPrice exists and is a valid value; so even if gas price is not used by a dapp, getTransaction would begin failing, since that requisite is no longer true. If you break backwards compatibility, you have to give time for things to migrate along.",
