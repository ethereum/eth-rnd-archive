        "content": "I think the core of this discussion might be that tx type EIPS differ from most other EIPs by the fact that there is no clear technological base line - at least not by definition - due to the nature of the tx type EIP defining tx types to be self-contained.\n\nFor the exising EIPs the history is still relatively obvious with `EIP-2930` adding some feature (access lists) to the Legacy Transaction and `EIP-1559` being a distinct successor to `EIP-2930`. This will become less and less obvious over time though, e.g. if there are three distinct tx types D1, D2, D3 out there in the wild.\n\nI would therefore be a fan if we make it a good practice to always explicity state from which tx type a new type is derived as well as adding a table with feature \u0026 compatibility notes on how a new tx type relates to all other already accepted types (does this make sense?).\n\nThinking this further things can also get very complex with new tx types pretty soon. Let's consider the situation from above with distinct tx types **D1**, **D2**, **D3**.\n\nIf a new tx type **F1** with a distinct feature being independent from the existing tx type structure (`EIP-2930`  with optional access is a good example) is added this theoretically would need to be added to all existing tx types, then leading to 6 types **D1**, **D2**, **D3**, **D1F1**, **D1F2**, **D3F3** in total.\n\nAnother type **F2** will again double this number, **D1F2**, **D2F2**, **D3F2**, **D1F1F2**,... This will get out of hand pretty soon (let me know if you can follow me so far).\n\nI would therefor think that we should structurally think about tx type deprecation (respectively retirement) pretty much from the beginning. Maybe it would also be a good practice for an EIP author to add deprecation recommendations for all existing tx types and the decisions then being made in ACD?\n\nThis would get concrete on the question if we might directly want to retire EIP-2930 in favor of EIP-1559 along London? 🤔 Has this been discussed explicitly?",
