        "content": "Hi all. I had a question regarding `BeaconBlocksByRoot` request. I have two use cases for this request in mind:\n(1) requesting parent block by root(`block.parent_root`) for a orphan block received over gossip and\n(2) requesting attested block by root(`attestation.data.beacon_block_root`) for an attestation received over gossip\n\nIf these two use cases make sense, my question is that these two kind of roots are of type `SigningRoot` however in `BeaconBlocksByRoot` we request roots by type `HashTreeRoot`.\nMaybe I'm not aware of it but is there a way to convert root from one type to another?",
