One may send a set of random hashes and according to the spec node has to do database lookup for each of those hashes. In a vast majority of cases random `null` lookups bypasses all caches and eventually hits disk, even bloom filters won't help much in there. A node might want to stop querying database after first non-existent entry and respond back with blocks retrieved before null-entry occurred.",
