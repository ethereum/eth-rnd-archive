I’m wondering if there’s a chance this could become a viable business model in the future, similar to how staking providers operate today.\n\nThis is probably the wrong place to ask, but if anyone has thoughts on whether there will be a sustainable role for independent provers, or can point me to good resources or communities discussing this, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nThanks a lot!",
