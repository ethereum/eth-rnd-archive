Otherwise the output is not truly an output: it's still a private input that is only committed to via the hash.",

    "content": "Yeah I agree, I imagine proof verification would look something like this:\n\n```rust\n// PublicInput is always the unhashed data\nfn verify(proof : Proof, public_inputs: PublicInput) -> bool {\n    let maybe_hashed_public_inputs = public_inputs;\n\n    // Needs to match write_output\n    if public_inputs.len() > 32 {\n       maybe_hashed_public_inputs = hash(public_inputs)\n    }\n    \n    return _verify(proof, maybe_hashed_public_inputs)\n}\n```\n\nFrom the perspective of the user, they will need to always pass in the unhashed public input so the data would always be available, and the verify function would encapsulate the fact that sometimes it is hashed.",
