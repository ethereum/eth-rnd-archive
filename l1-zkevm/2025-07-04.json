Do you know what it is being used for in matterlabs and what bit sizes?\n\nIn our benchmarks, I believe modexp was one of the worse offenders. \n\nIts essentially a function that allows you to do modular exponentiation with upto 8192 bits (reference for others)\nComing back to the original question, the gas usage of modexp for proof verification in our contracts isn't too much, so this modification wouldn't have a big impact.
