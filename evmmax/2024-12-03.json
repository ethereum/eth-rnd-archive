I added a provisional cost model based on the implementation in Geth and pricing against the performance of the ecrecover precompile on my M2 macbook pro.\n\n  The full Geth implementation is here:  https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30840 .\n\nI think that this is a good base to start implementing various crypto operations as EVM contracts using EVMMAX.",
