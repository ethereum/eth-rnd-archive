Coding Falcon in Solidity might not be the best experience (and it’s probably quite gas-costly). On top of that, there are even nastier problems, such as the fact that Falcon deals with 13-bit numbers, while Solidity only supports U256. The latter is the kind of issue that could be addressed by adding SIMD and EVMMAX to the EVM.\n\nthread: https://ethresear.ch/t/so-you-wanna-post-quantum-ethereum-transaction-signature/21291\n\nShould we start thinking about including in our use-cases short-list?",
