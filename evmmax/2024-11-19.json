        "content": "i think the argument that some moduluses (moduli?) could _maybe_ be used for DOS is interesting. Maybe it's worth whitelisting some primes to start, then doing research and removing the whitelist in the future?\n\nthings this eip is useful for:\n- reducing the cost of existing STARK verifiers\n- reducing the cost of arithmetization friendly hash functions\n- reducing the favoritism toward ECC (especially as we approach quantum supremacy)\n- reducing the need for future precompiles\n- allowing experimentation with more powerful cryptographic systems onchain with reasonable gas costs (this is a large blocker for PSE)\n- kills demand for server based compression into alt_bn128/bls based proofs\n\nthis is super exciting for me because as we roll new implementations of arguments of knowledge/asymmetric encryption/streaming proofs/etc. we can stick them onchain immediately\n\nIt also unlocks more bespoke cryptography for smart contracts/dapps and (hopefully) pushes us away from dependence on circom",
