From memory, the results were around an order of magnitude slower than what you guys current get over DevP2P which matches roughly with our expectations for this experiment. \n\nWe don't believe these results are representative of the throughput that can be expected to be possible from Portal for two main reasons.  Trin currently has a performance bottleneck that hasn't been identitifed which is preventing us from coming even close to saturating our network pipe.  Fluffy (The Nim client) has demonstrated much faster sync speeds in some of their historical tests of this functionality.",

Fluffy's historical tests suggest it should be trivial for Portal to serve block history at a speed faster than block processing speed which is ultimately the bottleneck for full history sync.",
