        "content": "As I understand it the history network will continue to exist as an extension to current EL clients as the different client teams commit to implementing it. I heard the Geth team will participate. The scope will change so that stand alone clients are not necessarily supported. But the participating clients will still serve the history data. And AFAICT the current clients verify the data via sync commitees. So... Can I take the Samba client and make sure it is up to date with any changes in the FIND_CONTENT protocol and continue to use that on an Android device to get the historic block data and verify it in the same way it is supposed to be verified already? What am I missing?",

        "content": "The reasons why stand alone clients are not really supported:\n- there will be only block bodies and receipts on the history network (so no headers), and they won't have any proofs attached to them\n  - also, at least for now, it will only be pre-merge data (this might change later this year/early next year, but it probably won't go all the way to the head of the chain, like it was the case in the Portal context)\n- this is based on the assumption that participants are EL clients (which store all headers)\n\nSo depending on your use case, you might no longer have the data you care about, or you might not be able to prove the data.\nDoes that answer your question?",
