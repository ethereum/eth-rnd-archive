        "content": "Hi all, \n\nHere are a few important portal updates following the Ethereum Foundation’s recent reorg:\n\n1. The EF will no longer be maintaining its portal implementations (Trin \u0026 Ultralight). All code will remain available and open source, but we do not expect active development to continue.\n2. We have begun reaching out to external portal implementers about grants and will continue to do so over the coming weeks. If this concerns you and you have not yet heard from the EF, please ping \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e \n3. For pre-merge expiry, we will update https://eth-clients.github.io/history-endpoints and include instructions for all clients on both mainnet and Sepolia. Expect an announcement soon! \n\nSome teams may choose to use Portal’s history network, but going forward we expect this to be decoupled from history expiry work.",

The history network is a useful idea and we will pursue integration in Geth still.\n\nThis has implications. If you wanted to connect to Portal with a standalone client, you'd need to get light client proofs of headers to verify the canon chain. But if we just see it as a store of history, we don't need the proofs anymore since the EL nodes have the header chain available and can always cross check against it.",
