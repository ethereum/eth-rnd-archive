        "content": "I haven't monitored this yet on an actual setup with CL + EL + Portal node, but I will do this somewhat soonish.\nBut I think this added load will be too low to cause any issues. When looking at our fleet nodes, they use a very low amount of CPU \u0026 memory. Disk access is only being pushed when pruning (we actually run 32 nodes per machine, so 32 nodes are hitting that same disk), but pruning will not occur in a EL + portal setup as we will have static radius. \n\nAnd sure, there will be extra discv5 activity but that is still very light weight compared to other p2p traffic going on. Of course, all depends on how many requests are happening on the network. But also there, this should be less than what we have seen so far as we might actually disable gossip (offer/accept) for the beginning?",

        "content": "An other instance we have seen where our nodes would be pushed a bit more is when starting up with a 100% radius, as it would be receiving and processing everything initially. This is why this gets typically set to a lower, sane value. Still, it was able to handle this, but it is unnecessary load. And again, as we are using a static radius for EL integration, this conveniently becomes no longer an issue.",
