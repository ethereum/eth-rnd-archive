I'm not sure yet if we want to keep Portal version of the beacon network around. The post-merge proofs for headers do rely on BeaconState's historical_summaries proof though. But this can be requested via beacon REST API (for Nimbus at least, not standardized currently) and as you mentioned, the headers aren't required for EL. I would prefer not to slim down Portal history further by dropping those though, but there would be some difficulty in generating these proofs, from an EL PoV.\nAnd yes, having ELs as node injecting the data was always the long term idea. But it was never pushed for/relied on for/until now.",

I assume this means any research on this will be stopped? By extension, does that mean that no research in general will be supported (for now?) on providing state for future stateless clients (whichever future of statelessness is selected)?\n\nI noticed this answer related to this: https://nitter.poast.org/tkstanczak/status/1932946876556341483\nWhich acknowledges a need for this, but at the same time also completely avoids confirming or denying that anything will be done for it. Just \"rethinking\". A rather unsatisfying answer imo.",
