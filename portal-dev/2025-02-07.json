I want to become a contributor to eth, I’d love your guidance on the best way to approach it for a head start. Given my strong background in blockchain and software architecture also I have gone through bitcoin architecture and its codebase in detail over the past few months , I can pick things up quickly. Thanks for any help that will be provided \n\nThis is the og best community of eth core so asked it here , if this is not right place to ask , Im sorry !\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",
