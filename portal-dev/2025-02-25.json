On rare occasions, I've gone as far back as 4-6 weeks. It currently looks like we have ~1yr of data.\nThe reason I'm bringing it up now is that glados pages load much too slowly. I'm considering deleting old data as one of the options for speeding it up. Obviously there are several paths to performance improvement, but that's probably the lowest engineering time.",
