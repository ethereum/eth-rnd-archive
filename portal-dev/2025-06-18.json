The TLDR is that we will not support a standalone Portal client for the foreseeable future and instead focus on supporting the EL's needs for history storage and retrieval.\n\nMeeting agenda is here, please post any specific topics you'd like to discuss beforehand: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1578",
