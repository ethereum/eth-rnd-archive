Isn't the number of aggregate messages per slot = committe_count_per_slot * num_aggregators_per_committee (16)? If this is the case the number of aggregate messages per slot according the above numbers would be: 61 * 16 = 976. I think this `8000 aggregates floating around per slot` refers to `8000 attestations/unaggregated floating around per slot`, but assuming a beacon node serving a single validator (which is an aggregator) they need to be subscribed to a single `beacon_attestation_{subnet_id}` topic, and for this topic they would receive only the attestations for the committee (128 messages). So is it safe to say that a beacon node serving a single validator (which is an aggregator) would need to validate roughly:\n- 128 messages from the `beacon_attestation_{subnet_id}` topic\n- 976 messages from the `beacon_aggregate_and_proof` topic  (assuming all the messages from the network are received, or is it safe to assume that around ~10% would be received here?)",
