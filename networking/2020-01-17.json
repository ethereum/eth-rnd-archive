Head can be after the range. But if before the end of the range, I don't think clients will give a stable answer, or if any at all. The spec does not require anything there (afaik). Could be no response, capped, or default to some later block in the subtree of your specified head. I would ask in the Prysm API discord chat if that's what you're working with.",

It's easy to give a head root of a block I already know, but that's not particularly helpful when the future blocks could fork.  If I have a lot of peers with the majority having the same finalized epoch and head root (from the `status` request) I'm okay, but if down to a single peer I guess I'll have to just trust its announced head root.",
