        "content": "hmm, i cant think of a direct way to achieve that. I can offer the following ideas:\n1. Have 2 ELs and CLs running locally. One on your main IP, the other on your failover. Your validator can connect to both beacon nodes, ensuring its not offline. \n2. Get a VPS and tunnel all traffic for your EL/CL via that VPS using a VPN (i can recommend wireguard). Then advertise the public IP of the VPS, since you have a full tunnel - everyone from the outside world sees you as the VPS IP. Wireguard for e.g has a configurable keepalive, i.e, when your failover happens it'll establish a new route and you should always be online. No changes needed to the setup.\n3. Time taken to get new peers shouldn't be too high, just stay offline for a bit 🙂",
