Format would be `product/major.minor.patch` e.g. ` prysm/1.2.3`.\n\nRationale behind this is there will inevitably be problems with some particular versions of particular clients, and at current there is no way of knowing if a peer is a problematic node or not.\n\nDownside of this is we would be sending static data in `status`.  There could be a separate `hello` message that contains this information but that would be a larger change to the spec.",
