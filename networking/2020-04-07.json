If the proposer_index cannot immediately be verified against the expected shuffling, the block MAY be queued for later processing while proposers for the block's branch are calculated.\n```\nFor this do we require that we have each block's parent saved and processed before processing the current block. Or do we just need to simply verify that the block is valid according to the current shuffling ?",
