My hope is to get a bunch of networking test cases in here that are easy to read/run against all clients by anyone. The test runner is now stable to run and if you have the time to try running it, I'd love to get feedback/thoughts on:\n1. test cases to put in here\n2. startup scripts for specific clients (I only have lighthouse implemented so far: https://github.com/lsankar4033/stethoscope/tree/master/clients/lighthouse)",
