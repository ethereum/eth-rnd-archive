Both of them are still at an early stage. Given that they are at the core of libp2p, I think it is worth being aware of them already.\n\nHappy to answer any questions, either here or via mail. Also, feel free to send any general libp2p questions my way.\n\n\u003c@!498009160982724610\u003e  mentioned a regular Ethereum 2 call. In case you want to discuss the two proposals there, let me know.",
