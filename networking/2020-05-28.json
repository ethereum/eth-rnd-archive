It will also contain the signature, so it's essentially just a different serialization scheme for the ENR.\n\nAlternatively, if we fail to include all the data, the client must implement a new category of discovery v5 records, which we can call \"trusted\" records (because they lack a proper signature). It's a bit awkward to support this as an additional type in the code and such addresses can't be included in the routing tables and shared with other peers through the protocol\n\ncc \u003c@!498009160982724610\u003e",
