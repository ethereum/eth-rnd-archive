However in order to run peer scoring there are quite a few fixed parameters to define with regards to it. https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#peer-scoring \nThe spec doesn't specify anything regarding it, wanted to know what is the plan currently for it. Will this be left to individual clients separately to decide on the params, or will we come to a common parameter values to use in the future after more simulation/testing ?",
