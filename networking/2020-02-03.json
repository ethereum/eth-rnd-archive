B) we prefix the length of the actual data, stream compression and decompression, stream encoding and decoding, except for calculation of the encoded size to write the prefix.\n\nPrysm has implemented A. Others don't seem to have compression support yet (lighthouse has WIP PR, others just pull in snappy and don't seem to use the dependency). If chunks can be big, I like B better. If not, then stay with A.\nMostly worried that because we don't know what other types of chunks we will send as chunks, it may turn out to be a bad decision.\nMaybe we can do an option C: length prefix for both the compressed as uncompressed chunk payload?\nOr just commit to simplicity and current chunks.
