        "content": "Hi everyone, I want to ask few questions regarding spam prevention at the p2p interface, more specifically at the gossipsub domain. I've read the spec and went through the rationale, but I couldn't figure out what are the spam prevention measures taken at this level. Gossipsub-v1.1 has some flags for peer scoring and that is the main way for dismissing peers that spam (although this is on local level, as each node maintains the reputation list for his peers). However, I don't see those flags used (at least they are not defined in the spec). I see that Extended Validators are defined and each message is classified as ACCEPT, REJECT or IGNORE, which based on this classification the peers would be scored, but again I don't see how the P4 penalty would be triggered as the P4 flags are not explicitly defined.\n\nMy main questions are:\n- What happens if the nodes spam the network with junk messages that result in IGNORE?\n- What happens if the nodes spam the network with junk messages that result in REJECT?\n\nBasically my concern is that nodes can spam the network with junk messages, without being punished/slashed as they don't violate any of slashing rules and also peer scoring rules. \n\nI couldn't figure out at this point from the specification how much the peer scoring features are used as in the specification this is mentioned \"Note: Gossipsub v1.1 introduces a number of additional parameters for peer scoring and other attack mitigations. These are currently under investigation and will be spec'd and released to mainnet when they are ready.\", however reading various github issues P4 weights are mentioned and other peer scoring features. \nIn my opinion the spec should have more explicit description on this topic.",
