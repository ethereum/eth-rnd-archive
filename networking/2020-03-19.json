We're chasing at building something that solves this: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1637\n\nA related issue, is that currently we haven't specified a ping protcol in libp2p. I.e to check peer liveness. We could use STATUS messages to check peer liveness. Adding the subnet bitfield to STATUS messages breaks backwards compatibility, but is one way to go, as it gives us peer's subnet bitfields regularly.\n\nAnother solution would be to add a discv5-like PING protocol to our RPC. This would be another method that just sends our ENR seq number to a peer to check its liveness. The peer responds with their seq number. If the seq number is higher than what we know about we have a method to request the ENR. This approach gives us access to all peers ENR's in the case that we want to add further fields, not just the subnet bitfields to ENRs to access in our clients.\n\nI'm chasing people's preference on which way to go, before we start building this. Or alternative solutions.",
