No immediate breaking changes.\n- Need to coordinate to disable verification of From/Seqno/Signature/Key (we don't use it, message-ID is content-based, it only uses Data), and accept it if the data is omitted from  any message (already `optional` in protobuf definition)\n- Proposal: Give it a week or two for every Medalla node to update into no-verification mode, where these fields can be nil\n- Then later move into strict mode, where messages that use any of the fields are not accepted anymore.\n- Result: avoid privacy and verification issues of fields that are not used in Eth2.",
