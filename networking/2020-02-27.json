We are giving ourselves an epoch in advance to search for peers on subnets. \nI'm going to attempt to randomly search for peers rather than crawl and see how that goes. \nI might add a special search that can specify an ENR predicate which only counts peers in a query if the predicate is satisfied. In effect it will crawl the DHT until enough peers are found, but this could take a while depending on your UDP packet  timeout.",
