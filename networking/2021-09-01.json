With IPV4 addresses being in short supply some ISP/VPS providers do not provide you with a static address and along with that the ability to receive traffic through a public port. Also some users run their node through a VPN, where this might not be an option too. Don't think we can make this a hard requirement without cutting off a non trivial amount of node operators.",
