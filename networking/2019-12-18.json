        "content": "when the `status` message is exchanged is up to each client as it sees fit - generally, there's no reason to exchange them unless you want to sync with that client - under normal operation, you're getting everything you need from gossip, so it's only while syncing that you might be interested in status. when you're syncing, you're transferring blocks - if a block is 10kb and you add 100 bytes of status every time you request a block, that's a 1% overhead. Most of the time though, you'll likely be requesting a range of blocks at a time, driving the status down further.",
