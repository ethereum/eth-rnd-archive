        "content": "Does anyone know if there is a data available for the network stats of a beacon node (or any \"monitoring\" stats at all)? For example data such as messages received, messages propagated, beacon node \u003c-\u003e validator client networking stats, validator \"idle time\" (the amount of seconds when the validator is not producing attestations/creating blocks, etc)? Of course those should be averages, as I assume the variance between different beacon-nodes could be huge, or maybe a curated data set with those stats? \nI haven't found anything yet (besides validator data from beaconcha.in and beaconscan), and I assume the best way would be to run a beacon node and find it out myself which I look forward to do as a last resort. I think having such public data (or averages dataset) would be generally helpful for various types of research.",
