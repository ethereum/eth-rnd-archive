        "content": "That topic may become even more interesting in the light of upcoming Merge. \n\nOn the beacon mainnet my peer (without validators) had about 47 of 50 connected peers with subnet subscriptions, meaning that the current beacon main net is mostly validator nodes (47 of 50 was just a single snapshot and is not pretending to be a statistics)\nAfter the merge the proportion of validator and non-validator nodes would most likely significantly change in favor of non-validator nodes. (should we expect just 20% or 5% of all nodes would be validating?)\n\nWould validating nodes become eagerer for other validating nodes to be connected to? (because it would probably be harder to find and connect to nodes with subnets)\nWould it significantly change network topology? (e.g. would it naturally form validator and non-validator subnets weakly connected?)\nDoes it probably make sense to obligate non-validator nodes to persist on at least 1 subnet?",
