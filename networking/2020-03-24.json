The additional clarity would be super helpful to have.  I'll add a comment to discuss for the next call.  Thanks everyone",

So in order to make them indistinguishable they would need to implement all the req/resp messages, right?  How do u see this working?",

The latter is inconvenient, the former weakens BFT properties of the mesh.",
