Very useful for dispelling myths + articulating the designs of ETH2.\n\nI'm wondering if this group would consider coming on the Gitcoin livestream sometime and doing a roundtable with a couple gitcoin community leaders who will be peppering in questions about your work.\n\nIn the past we've taken content like this and spliced it up into digestible youtube clips, which then were a pretty big hit on twitter/reddit - driving thousands of views.  Here is an example https://gitcoin.co/blog/eth-2-0-qa-with-key-developers/\n\nI think its very important that the community is able to understand the design, implementation, and importance of the future of ETH.  So we'd be happy to be of service by giving you a platform to talk about these things!\n\nTime investment would be an hour per person, we'd need 3-4 of you to make the show work.  We typically do livestreams every Friday at 2pm EST.  \nDoes any of the following work for you?\n- July 17\n- July 24\n- July 31\n- August 7",
