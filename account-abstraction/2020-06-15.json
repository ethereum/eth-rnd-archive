We need to expand tests further and do some cleanup (WIP) but it is working at this point.\n- We are collecting data, performance metrics right now and will share results in due time. We are using https://github.com/lightclient/bazooka to stress test and send transactions across the wire.\n- We are currently creating AA transactions which use calldata to determine the # of loops (each 26 gas), whether the validation calls the `PAYGAS` opcode, and what gas price is called via  `PAYGAS`\n- We are now starting brainstorming sessions to begin discussion on expanding beyond the initial MVP to support multiple txs per account, proxy patterns, and other improvements",
