Contract wallet that doesn't require signer have gas money.\n**Sponsored Transactions**.  Totally unrelated address pays for gas than is `CALLER`.  `CALLER` can be a contract wallet\n**Multi-action transactions**.  Example: Approve then Call atomically, both with `msg.sender` of owner.\n**EOA == Contract**.  `isHuman` and `isContract` should not be possible.  Contracts should not be able to discriminate against people securing their assets smartly!\n**Arbitrary Executions**.  A contract wallet should be able to do arbitrary things, not only what it was programmed to do (e.g., caller passes an array of contracts and calldatas to call in order).\n**Third Party Callers**. A contract wallet should be able to receive incoming calls from other contracts.\n**Account Storage**. A contract wallet should be able to store data, and that data should be publicly visible.",
