We'll test these assertions after the initial MVP is done and we have our initial data on it\n- We have a method to inject the AA marker into EVM bytecode which rejects non-aa transactions - https://github.com/adietrichs/aa-tools - this is a temporary way to achieve this for testing and has much room for optimization\n- TX pool, transaction models have been adjusted/changed in a beta form to support basic MVP with many optimizations/improvements needed down the road",
