However the transaction pool/validation/replay also would have to be changed, making it possible for developers to create a contract that accepts to be called only by coinbase.  The changes in the transaction pool are better explained in this soft fork proposal (Gas Abstraction) https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7dbd4d0e94f35826e6c6e2390715c4e62e614539/EIPS/eip-2473.md",
