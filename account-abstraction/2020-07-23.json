In our situation we're focused on account abstraction right now and its feasibility for eth1 (possible for eth2 instead depending on results which we're collecting). This serves as a precursor for some improved execution patterns for the future and leads us into research related to stateless mining, SSA and other pieces. We're happy to talk about what is on our mind. There are 3 big categories I'd say right now:\n1. Eth2 and its direction towards phase 1.5 then phase 2\n2. Eth1.x statelessness which has a very active community\n3. Updates to the execution engine of eth1 and eth2 (which we continue to explore)\n\nWe are knowledgable on 1, 2 and 3, but if you want to cover all of these there are strong ppl from each category. The 3rd we could have a lot to talk about. So my Q for you would be around what do you want the focus to mostly be around?",
