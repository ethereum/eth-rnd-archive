If I have 10000 AA contracts that all do a `STATICCALL` into some contract `0xbaadf00d...` and read a variable (prior to `PAYGAS`), someone can set that variable such that all 10000 of those AA contracts are invalidated with a single external call.  How would you determine how much `RESERVE_GAS` is needed (in this case, we need to ensure it is 10,000 * minimum)?",
