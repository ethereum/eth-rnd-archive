Very useful for dispelling myths + articulating the designs of ETH2.\n\u003e \n\u003e I'm wondering if this group would consider coming on the Gitcoin livestream sometime and doing a roundtable with a couple gitcoin community leaders who will be peppering in questions about your work.\n\u003e \n\u003e In the past we've taken content like this and spliced it up into digestible youtube clips, which then were a pretty big hit on twitter/reddit - driving thousands of views.  Here is an example https://gitcoin.co/blog/eth-2-0-qa-with-key-developers/\n\u003e \n\u003e I think its very important that the community is able to understand the design, implementation, and importance of the future of ETH.  So we'd be happy to be of service by giving you a platform to talk about these things!\n\u003e \n\u003e Time investment would be an hour per person, we'd need 3-4 of you to make the show work.  We typically do livestreams every Friday at 2pm EST.  \n\u003e Does any of the following work for you?\n\u003e - July 17\n\u003e - July 24\n\u003e - July 31\n\u003e - August 7\nHi Quilt and all, \u003c@378595508748550145\u003e  has offered Fri Oct 9 at 2pm Eastern. How does that sound?  (Invite could be about “call for dapp, core, infra/exchange devs to learn about Account Abstraction and provide feedback on eip 2938”)",
