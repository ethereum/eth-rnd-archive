However, that could be introduced at a later date.\n\nFor a quick update, we are releasing a feasibility study based on metrics we collected for the minimal implementation. As Ansgar mentioned, we're also publishing multiple discussions on expanding AA's capabilities. A catchup call would be helpful - (thinking early next week when we'll have our drafts completed) and we'll send them ahead of time.",
