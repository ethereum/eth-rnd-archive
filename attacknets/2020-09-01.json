Planned move of keystores to prysm while updating lighthouse was not effective; prysm peers had problems restarting into a chain without finalizing peers.\n- Teku is temporarily down as well. Took the keys out for a full redeploy of keys, but having problems with restarting nodes, investigating the issue there.\n- Resyncing lighthouse (they changed db schema), which should then help the chain get back online.",
