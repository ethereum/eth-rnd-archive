We are spinning up new infra for devnets, and if you need a v1.0.0 network to test and bug hunt, you are more than welcome to join those.\nWe are starting off next week with a devnet with a single week lifespan, then moving to a bigger longer net. Just contact me if you want to jump in early. Later larger net will be public, dev-controlled, and a good target for bug hunting.",
