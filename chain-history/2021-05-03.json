I think with a similar approach it might be possible to serve eth state for light-clients that function directly in the browser, if the right file format and data structures are used such that the number of queries are reduced enough to overcome network latencies. I think the work done by beam sync effort/team is already kind of in this direction anyways thanks to \u003c@!364458974906548225\u003e  and others",
