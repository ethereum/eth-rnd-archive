        "content": "One question about the regenesis model: how does it work between three epochs? That is, suppose you're currently in epoch N, and you're trying to access an account that was last modified during epoch N-2. Do you (i) need to provide both a witness for epoch N-2 and a witness for epoch N-1 to prove no subsequent change, or (ii) is there some crazy merge process when epoch N-1 ends that combines together the two states, or (iii) something else?",
