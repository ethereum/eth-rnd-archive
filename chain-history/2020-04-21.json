It would be quite trivial to extend the existing Discovery V5 protocol to serve content via key/value DHT structure.  Even a boring vanilla DHT could easily provide all of the historical chain data (headers/receipts/blocks).\n2. The SkipGraph looks like a viable tool for a more complex DHT that supports range queries.  This could be used to improve the efficiency of retrieval of chain data.  Support for range queries are probably required if we want to host and serve state data on this network.\n\nI'll work on an post for the research forum to better capture these things.",
