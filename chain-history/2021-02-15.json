I'm curious how predictable gas costs would be for \"warming up\" old state.\nWould there be a constant \"warmup\" cost or would it be an increment of the cold period?\ne.g. With a cold period of 1 month.\nSo if I need state from 6 months ago I pay 6x the warmup gas price?\nSo the older state becomes the more expensive to use it? That would mean that eventually we would have a lot of expensive to use, effectively orphaned state.\nThat would probably remove some use cases for ethereum.",
