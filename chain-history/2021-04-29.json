        "content": "Is there anyone who would be interested in authoring an EIP to add an accumulator to the block header for the Eth1 chain.  The accumulator would be modeled loosely after the beacon chain accumulator for historical block headers.  (https://ethresear.ch/t/double-batched-merkle-log-accumulator/571).  Probably a new field in the block header.  Probably something that would contain at least (block_hash, total_difficulty).  This is valuable work towards making eth1 more friendly to light clients.  Worth noting that the total_difficulty inclusion is a little awkward at this stage with the merge being close around the corner, but we can work out that detail along the way.",
