You can find the source here: https://github.com/ethereum/alexandria  (It is heavily based on the protocol used by discovery v5.)\n\nOver the next week my focus will be on implementing basic storage and retrieval of content by a key and then one of the DHT mechanisms for doing range queries.  Currently I'm leaning towards [Skip Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_graph).  Once I've got this working my plan will be to try and do some live testing.  I'll spin up a number of nodes myself (as well as probably asking for volunteers to run them as well) and then feed the header chain into the network and experiment with various queries to see how the network performs for things like random lookups or actually pulling the full dataset back out of the network.",
