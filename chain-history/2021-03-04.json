        "content": "Ah k thanks for the explanation here \non this:\n\u003e - Probably elimination of  hash_tree_root and in-protocol multi-packet responses in favor of something like minimal implementation of  uTP (https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html) for streaming larger data payloads between nodes (block bodies can easily be 50kb).\nIs there any reason to continue going forward with UDP here vs TCP ? Do you anticipate these larger payloads might inadvertently end up throttling any other active TCP connections ? Or would this mostly be for implementation simplicity(constrained to Discv5)",

        "content": "More for implementation simplicity.   1) Both transaction gossip and new state gossip are likely to be networks with a structured topology.  This topology is likely to be heavily informed by the topology of the DHT.  It seems elegant to not have to perform another handshake/negotiation over TCP when the nodes are already communicating over UDP  2) If we can achieve what we need with a single protocol then all clients only need DiscV5 and we can avoid added complexity of libp2p stuff  3) this is all somewhat dependent on whatever approach is used to do larger data transfers over UDP being performant enough   4) the native congestion control might be a really nice thing to have so that a background client doesn't impact other applications that are using the internet on the same machine.  we are shooting for lightweight.",
