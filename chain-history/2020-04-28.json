We think the key to that is to allow them to efficiently cache the most active account and contract state.\n\nWe've put a document containing our proposal here:\n\nEnabling Efficient Caching of Accounts and Contracts in Eth1.x and Eth2 using Referrers https://hackmd.io/-_II-qyQR6OOeS8J7gMVgQ?view\n\nAny reviews, comments, edits or suggestions would be wonderful. Cheers.\n\n\u003c@!364458974906548225\u003e You might want to have a look prior to our call tomorrow.\n\nSpecial thanks to \u003c@!689635476826619924\u003e \u003c@!688889240125308981\u003e \u003c@!636680106630316033\u003e and others not on Discord for their contribution to this proposal!",
