This is where I would see the application of B+-trees, so that you won't need to recalculate commitments in all the structures, but only in O(log N) number of them. But, of course, any self-balancing trees pose a question of the commitment being dependent of the order of modification. I do not think this is an insurmountable problem though,  and I have done a lot of thinking (and some experimenting) on this in the context of AVL+trees when working on early Ethermint",
