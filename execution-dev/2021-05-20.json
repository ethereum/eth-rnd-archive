A factory is used to ensure every node is using legitimate and verifiable chequebook contracts. Once the chequebook is deployed, Bee will deposit a certain amount of gBZZ (Goerli BZZ tokens) in the chequebook contract so that it can pay other nodes in return for their services.",

It's our most complete protocol specification and it's incredibly difficult to contribute to or update, tends to lag behind the actual forks, and it's difficult to \"version\" it so discerning old fork rules isn't simple.\n\nOver the years there have been a few efforts/attempts to create a new canonical spec.... they haven't gone anywhere.\n\nThe `eth2-specs` have been really successful in ways that the yellow paper and attempts to replace it haven't been so some of us have been thinking that it would be beneficial to re-write the yellowpaper in the eth2-specs format.  You might be interested in this project...  and so is \u003c@!543900561460822016\u003e .",
