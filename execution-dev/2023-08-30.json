        "content": "Question related to Cancun:\nFor block number based hardforks, while testing locally, we can simply set a block number in genesis.json file and the hardfork will occur after that many blocks have been formed. How can I easily do that for time based hardfork like cancunTime? Every time I run it I need to set a new value which will be current time + few mins.\nIs there an easy way to do it so that I don't need to keep changing any value and cancun hardfork will occur after few blocks only? Thanks!",
