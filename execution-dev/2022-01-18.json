        "content": "Are there designs for data availability via an L2 layer? So that we can avoid centrally planning data shards as well. E.g. assume a centralized L2 data provider. We could have an L1 contract commit to the L2 data shard state root, and also within the same contract give people a query interface that can -- on L1 -- request any data item that was implied by the data shard root via a Merkle proof. (So that the L2 data provider can't censor or deny requests arbitrarily). If the L2 data provider doesn't reply to that query on L1 with an answer on L1 within a specific amount of time, then the L1 contract burns a safety deposit from the L2 data provider. Seems pretty simple. I am sure that there are issues with that, that I haven't spotted.",
