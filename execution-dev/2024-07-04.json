We will be hosting a Portal focused core dev event of some kind at Devcon and my hope is that EL teams that are planning to integrate with Portal will have someone who's already engaged with the development process by that time.  Having EL teams gain an understanding of the Portal protocol prior to Devcon will make this core dev event much more productive.",
