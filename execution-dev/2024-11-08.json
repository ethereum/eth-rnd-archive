From my understanding, locking `finalized_checkpoint` gindex at the smart contract level would be the right way to go otherwise the user can trick your verifier. The only circumstance I'm aware so far that it could change is on hard forks. EIP-7688 was introduced to ensure gindexes are stable across forks but I'm unsure if that made it to Pectra (some discussion here: https://ethresear.ch/t/slashing-proofoor-on-chain-slashed-validator-proofs/19421/2).",
