Rather than continuing to kick the can down the road, I was thinking about introducing a new transaction type that would be SSZ encoded and it would just allow a user to sweep the ETH from an account, nothing more.  This is a desirable transaction type that should be relatively easy to add.  This would both solve a minor problem for Ethereum users, and provide a platform for introducing SSZ client libraries into the Execution clients.\n\nThe new transaction type would have the following fields: `to`, `chainId`, `priorityFeePerGas`, `maxFeePerGas`.  It would send all ETH in the account to the target account, *without* calling any contract/delegate there (like self destruct forcing ETH onto accounts).  It would log the ETH transfer.  Its gas cost would be fixed (which is why it doesn't call the recipient contract/delegate), so all ETH in the account can be transferred after accounting for gas fees, which would be fixed at start of transaction (before execution).\n\nAs allowed by EIP-2718 (typed transactions), the payload concatenated onto the transaction type number would be SSZ encoded.\n\nThis transaction would be trivial to SSZ encode/decode, so clients only have to dip their toes into SSZ encoding and shouldn't have to deal with any weird edge cases.  It forces us to lay the groundwork though, and get SSZ used in production execution clients.",
