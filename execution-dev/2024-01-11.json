The important part that i'm not sure I agree with yet is that the existence of a DOS vector should prevent an increase in gas targets.  i'm uncomfortable with the inductive nature of that. 🤔",

Thus we could never talk about it as freely as we can today",

I understand the reasoning behind not wanting to push the gaslimit beyond X based on \"secret knowledge\", I think that is fine. My concern was with saying \"we shouldn't go beyond 30M because in the past there were issues\" which was the takeaway I was getting. I find that to be bad reasoning, however \"among the known problems, none of them hurt at 40M\" would to me be sound logic.",
