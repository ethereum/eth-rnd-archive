Otherwise, EL or CL (depending on which layer upgrades first) would have to implicitly convert old payload version to the new one which is potentially dangerous. How would Engine API upgrade look like in this case?\n\nIf there is an upgrade that doesn't require coordination between layers then fine, it can be entirely transparent for unaffected layer. Thus, EL should have a fork trigger allowing for coordination with CL when needed.",
