        "content": "Okay idea: in prague we already have two header/body extensions coming up with EL triggered operations. Those are 7002 `WithdrawalRequest` and 6110 `Deposit`. I have the understanding that not only are there more desired ops to include in prague, there may be more and more in the future. For this reason, I've tried to contemplate a bit how we could have a more general framework for shuttling this data from the EL to the CL.\n\nThe tldr; is I think we could have a generic `Request` object in the EL and CL. On the EL it would be a typed opaque byte array (like txs) and we would only need to add `RequestsRoot` to the header. On the CL it would be a union of all the request types. We would pass the requests over JSON rpc and the CL can shuttle that data into their SSZ object and then process them.\n\nTo accumulate a blocks `Requests` on the EL, I think it would look similar to how we've already spec'd 6110 and 7002. Have a post-block operation that processes some data. In the 6110 case we parse the deposits out of the logs emited by the beacon deposit contract. For 7002 we actually make a system call to the withdrawal requests contract and dequeue some withdrawal requests. We'd take both of those pieces of data, serialize them, then shove them into the header (mpt'd) and body.\n\nsketch of an EIP https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8432\n\nthoughts ?",
