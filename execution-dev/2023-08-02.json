If only the tx sender is generating the commitments, then there is no real problem in validators computing KZG commitments.  they only have to verify the polynomial proofs.",

        "content": "Hi all, execution-API question.\n\nIn hive test `engine-blobs/NewPayloadV3 Before Cancun, 0x00 Data Fields, Empty Array Versioned Hashes`, we get a `engine_newPayloadV3` with the following conditions: the payload timestamp is pre-Cancun (it is Shanghai). However, the second argument of the payload is `null` (so the `parentBeaconBlockRoot` is `null`, which is invalid, it should always be 32 bytes by the spec: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/cancun.md#engine_newpayloadv3). Now the question is: what error should we return? In EthereumJS we first validate the input format, and then run additional checks (the timestamp check). Should we return invalid params because the format is wrong? `-32602: Invalid params`. Or should we return that the timestamp is below Cancun, so `-38005: Unsupported fork`? The spec is (for me) not clear about the order of these checks.",
