Users still receive the refund, but we don't \"free\" gas for a subsequent transaction. \n\nSince clearing a storage slot still effectively costs 200 gas, one cannot use refunds to do more \u003copcode\u003e calls per block. So, it doesn’t worsen any other existing worst-case scenarios. \nSince this is worst-case for snap sync's healing, it might be nice to have tests around it, if we don't already?",
