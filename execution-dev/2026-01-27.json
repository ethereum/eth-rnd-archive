It would be great to have your feedback on these splits. Do you think we should change any operation from one group to the other?\n\nAn important caveat is that these data is still based on Prague. Once we finish the test integration with Osaka, I expect some of these numbers to change slightly.",

The spec currently always emits them if selfdestruct is called to self, even if the contract is not ephemeral after 6780 and it's balance is not gonna be burned.\n\nShould we change it to be emitted only for ephemeral contracts, created in the same tx?",

        "content": "Maybe in general for the understanding of SELFDESTRUCT (so not SENDALL as in EIP-6780, i.e. 0xff SELFDESTRUCT in same transaction as the contract is being created). It does not work as the intuition might state, because it has multiple steps:\n\nUpon invoking the opcode, mark current contract to-be selfdestructed and send all balance to the target. Exit current call frame.\nAfter the transaction ends (I have to check when precisely, if this is AFTER the tx execution, but before or after the fee transfer to coinbase (this is thus also an test case which should be added: selfdestruct coinbase as the accounting for fees is interesting here)) destroy all the accounts marked as to-be-selfdestructed. This means deleting it from trie. (And thus also the only way to destroy ETH).\nIt does thus not mean, as intuition might lead one thinking, that it is immediately destroyed when invoking the opcode (the code which is deposited there thus keeps existing in the current transaction when it was created, as this is the only way to invoke SELFDESTRUCT; after the tx the invocation is SENDALL. (There is thus also a case where one does SELFDESTRUCT in initcode, and also SELFDESTRUCT after deposting the code in the same tx)\n\nFor EIP-7708: it should mark required EIPs: EIP-4788 (system address), EIP-1559 (fee transfer, EIP-6780 (only SELFDESTRUCT in same transaction)\n\nI think using LOG2 for burning is a very good choice. The only case when this is thus invoked is \"at the end of the transaction\" (and either before or after sending priority fee).\nIt should (I think) be noted that for the SELFDESTRUCT **AND** SENDALL case (when sending ether) it should work as normal as LOG3 (and should not log when sending to self). Only in case of SELFDESTRUCT when burning ether it should invoke the LOG2",
