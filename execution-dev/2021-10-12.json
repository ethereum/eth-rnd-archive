There’s been some cautioning messages that this will need to be run locally come merge, or alternatively that the whole enchilada needs to become 3rd party - consensus and execution both.\nBut the technical “and here is why” eludes me.\nI’ve reached out to Infura and will hopefully have a chat with them as well re post merge plans",
