These guys are reachable, they have lively discussions all the time with people at all levels of understanding.  Go to any other client's discord, and it's for the most part dead.  Today with the realization of the importance of community, you at least get answers on the other discords, but not too long ago you barely even got that.  And not to bash on anybody's team, I think the products from all teams are nothing but spectacular!",

In fact I have \"just a feeling\" that for the average user it may be even better than prysm Discord server since it seems to me that the percentage of knowledgeable people may be higher. I can't speak for the other clients but whenever I asked here Adrian or Jasek anything about their clients they were happy to help, I've seen Adrian do active support in ethsraker's. Prysm community is large so it helps finding bugs quickly, but I wouldn't agree with the rest of the quoted message",
