This would allow contracts like DEXes to do block auctions by accumulating trades throughout the block and then executing them all at the end.",

        "content": "Hi Ethereum developers, I'm Charles, the tech lead at Fusionist.\n\nWe’ve recently launched a website to track and benchmark the performance of several Ethereum clients over time: [Are We Fast Yet](https://arewefastyet.report). \nWe have a dedicated server that runs these tests every few days, recording the results. The client versions are regularly updated, allowing us to monitor how performance differences evolve over time.\n\nOn the right side of the page, you’ll find a \"Line/Heatmap\" button. This lets you switch to a heatmap view, making it easier to visually compare how each client stacks up against the top performer in each test case.\n\nAs for the motivation behind this project, while our Endurance chain isn't an Ethereum L2, we actually place an even greater emphasis on all clients performance. You can read more about this on the \"About This Site\" link in the footer.",
