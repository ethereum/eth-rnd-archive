I can see Nethermind and Besu set this value, but Geth and Erigon doesn't.\nAccording to the definition: https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/rlpx.md#hello-0x00, a 0 specifies the client is not listening. I guess that's referring to the p2p server.\nDo the client that set this value use it for anything? Should it be get in Geth?",
