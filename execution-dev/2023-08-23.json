        "content": "Hey all, had a quick question about randao / prevrandao. My understanding is that prevrandao is a value known before a block is produced, and calculable after the prior block is included (or validator randao contribution is revealed I guess) as a function of block randomness and reveal. Is this correct / incorrect? \n\nMainly wondering if, say a block is being constructed / proposed by a validator but has yet to be broadcast or included. Is the prevrandao value of this next block known to everyone? My understanding from the above would be yes, but having a hard time actually verifying this.",
