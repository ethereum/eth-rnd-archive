        "content": "Very nice! I strongly agree that JUMPDEST-analysis should be priced correctly in this case.  I also find that there is no JUMPDEST-analysis gas cost in contract-call-related opcodes (e.g., CALL/DELEGATECALL, where call gas is 700 and EXTCODECOPY is also 700, implying JUMPDEST-analysis cost is not included).  I think such analysis/metering should be applied to call-related opcodes as well 🙂",

        "content": "On the other side, EIP-5027 seems to be some-kind of parallel with EIP-3860 - even the INITCODE size is limited, the INITCODE can still return a contract code with any size (and thus written to the contract by CREATE/CREATE2).  Further, EIP-5027 focuses more on contract-read gas metering (CALL/DELEGATECALL/.. and EXTCODECOPY) to prevent DoS attack, while EIP-3860 is more on INITCODE side.  We can  discuss the details in the allcoredevs meeting.  Thanks!",
