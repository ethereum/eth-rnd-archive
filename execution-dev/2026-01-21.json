        "content": "I checked the latest EIP updates and now there is a different `Selfdestruct(address,uint256)` event ID defined just for selfdestructs that burn the ETH (send to same address). At the same time, selfdestructs transferring to a different address are still logged as standard ERC-20 `Transfer(address,address,uint256)`. Does this make sense? It just doesn't look elegant. It does not distinguish the selfdestruct-originated events, yet it uses a separate `Selfdesctuct` for some selfdestructs.\nThe real distinction here is that the amount is burned, and maybe we'll also want to log other burned amounts in the future. I'd suggest to call it `Burn(address,uint256)` instead.",
