For example (combined both account tree and smart contract state trees):\n- average and max depth\n- average number of tree nodes that are updated and/or created in a block\n- number of leaf nodes that are updated very frequently (e.g. at least once every 10 blocks)\n\nI assume this is something that execution client might already know, but I'm not sure if there is some dashboard or something\n\nApologies if this is not the best place to ask this, so feel free to point me to a better place.",
