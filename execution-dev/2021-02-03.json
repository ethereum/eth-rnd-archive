I'll be publishing a new updated document outlining them, but there's a key take-away that I realized and I want to dump it here.\n\nWhat I'm really wanting to do is address what I see as fundamental shortfalls of our protocol and networks so that we can have functional lightclients with radically improved UX.  Awesome fully features stateless clients are a side-effect of doing the work to have functional light clients.  I also believe that development of mainnet clients also becomes easier after doing this work.\n\nAnd some follow up thoughts.\n\n1. This doesn't change or deprioritize our current roadmap.  It is purely additive and shouldn't slow down existing plans.\n2. Rather than saying that stateless clients will be useless without JSON-RPC, I'm going to use the phrase \"of limited usefulness\" as there is value in the Eth2 context and other theoretical contexts like you mentioned in \u003c#796057759858425866\u003e channel.\n3. I'm still very skeptical that existing client development teams are going to actually do the \"last mile\" work to implement all of the functionality needed to take advantage of stateless block execution within a reasonable timeline.  Since stateless block execution is of limited usefulness, it seems unlikely that the work will be prioritized until the Eth2 merge firmly on the horizon...",
