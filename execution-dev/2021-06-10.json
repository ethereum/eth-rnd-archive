        "content": "Question about oracles: When uploading a new turing complete contract into the network (with potentially undefined, though deterministic behaviors), how is that different than an oracle affecting the history of the network?\n\nIn both situations, you're allowing potentially random data with random behaviors at random times, into the network... The uploading of those undefined behaviors in contracts are not deterministic. However, after they're read in, subsequent operations on that data are deterministic, so that makes sense to me.\n\nMy question is, why can't the same thing make sense for a json doc? After it is read in, subsequent operations on that data can still be deterministic...\n\nApologies if this is a stupid question. I'm not new to these kinds of threat models and deterministic behavior but I'm a little bit new to contract based blockchains and I'm just now getting my feet wet, so my assumptions could be naive. Thanks!",

Why wouldn't I just use that other network to begin with?",
