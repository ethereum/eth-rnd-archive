The original EIPs called it alt_bn128, but he 128 was for how much security it provided and that number also appears to be wrong.\n\nImpact is in 3 precompile lines. I can easily update besu's eth_config, any comments or concerns?  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10029#issuecomment-3085427144",
