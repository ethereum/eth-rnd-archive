I think it's fine if the api servers can just provide a proof of the latest proven state of big table chains directly to clients, along with the specific query proof using those tables.\nRegarding forks, with this design i think targeting hegota should be easy. With enough support we could even re-cfi it for glamsterdam 🙂",

    "content": "Quick update/request-for-feedback regarding **[EIP-7976](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7976)** (CFI'd for Amsterdam): I’ve opened a [draft PR](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/11264#issuecomment-3854037466) proposing to change calldata pricing from **15 / 60** (zero / non-zero byte) to a flat **64 / 64 gas per byte** *at the floor*.\n\n7976 builds on existing logic from  [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) (Pectra) but instead of just increasing the constant, the draft PR makes zero and non-zero bytes cost the same once the floor applies.\n\n* ~98% of transactions remain unaffected and continue to pay **4 / 16** gas.\n* ~2% of transactions hit the **64 gas/byte** floor.\n\n**Rationale:**\nCheap zero bytes allow worst-case *uncompressed* block sizes to exceed **10 MiB**, which we want to avoid. For max-size blocks, **zero bytes are just as bad for Snappy compression as non-zero bytes**, so distinguishing between them provides little benefit.\n\nWith current EIP-7976 pricing, ~10 MiB uncompressed blocks are reachable at ~**104M gas**.\nWith a flat 64 gas/byte floor, this remains safe up to ~**670M gas**.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n* **2.05%** of transactions over the last 6 months would have been affected.\n* **0.85%** of those already paid the floor due to **EIP-7623**.\n* Additional costs are highly concentrated among a small number of accounts.\n\nFull analysis [here](https://github.com/nerolation/eip-7976-repricing-reports/blob/main/report_64.md).",
