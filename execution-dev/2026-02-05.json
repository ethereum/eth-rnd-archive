    "content": "The historic table proofs can be completely independent from zkevm, they don't necessarily have to be on chain so i don't see a risk with the timelines. I think it's fine if the api servers can just provide a proof of the latest proven state of big table chains directly to clients, along with the specific query proof using those tables.\nRegarding forks, with this design i think targeting hegota should be easy. With enough support we could even re-cfi it for glamsterdam 🙂",
