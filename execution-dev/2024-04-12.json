        "content": "Hi there, Holger from EthereumJS. We are currently battling a bit with outdated `STATUS` information (so things like best hash, fork ID) for peers in our client when peers are already in the peer pool for some  time and the initial **devp2p `ETH` protocol `STATUS`** exchange happened some longer time ago.\n\nThis often leads to suboptimal decisions on how to leverage the respective peer, or even misleads into thinking a peer is useless while it is not. 🤔\n\nI've experimented a bit with simply re-sending `STATUS` after some time to a peer, but this seems not to be answered, also the specs https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/eth.md#status-0x00 state:\n\n\u003e This message should be sent just after the connection is established and prior to any other eth protocol messages.\n\nAnyone from \u003c@\u0026652918665943056397\u003e geth or another client here who can give some insight how you deal with this situation? Also pinging \u003c@360491619402776577\u003e since he has worked on the latest ETH protocol iterations.\n\nIs this (re-sending `STATUS` messages) worth to loosen in the protocol? Or is this \"in fact\" already loosened?",
