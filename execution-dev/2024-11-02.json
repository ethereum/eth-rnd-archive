After the shanghai attacks 1 wei was transferred in to all the potential precompiles so they woudln't be regarded as \"empty accounts.\"  Empty accounts (zero balance, zero length code, and zero nonce) have a hash of zero.  So in the the case of precompiles on mainnet as they are no longer empty accounts as they have a balance, their code is a zero length byte array, and the hash of a zero length byte array is `0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`",
