If this is not planned/needed for the launch, then likely all the verification can be done client side.\nHowever recursive snarks seems to be a good use case and I heard from people back in mid 2018 their wish to use bls12 for that reason.\nA while ago the \"eip-centric process\" was proposed and should we follow it these questions wouldn't be questions, because these EIPs wouldn't be pushed for a hard deadline, but considered once they are \"ready\".",

I am not in a position to tell the Eth2 team when to launch, nor when it is ready to launch phase 0, so i'm doing my best the situation as it is. In an ideal world a lot of these things wouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlso, Setting dates is a practical way to move things along. If we don't push EIPs then we run into the risk of them never reaching \"ready\".  Feedback like yours Axic is appreciated and needed. Talking about timeline is a good catalyst for uncovering the pieces that aren't ready and so they can be addressed.",

Introducing a not well tested change in Eth1x just for that might be one of the less efficient options.

Then there was a desire to do \"at least something\", and that \"something would be BLS curve, because it is used in Eth2.0 somehow\". And then there was a solution looking for a problem, and hence the \"chicken and egg problem\", IMO",
