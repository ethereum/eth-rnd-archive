        "content": "Technically you can always self destruct a contract but that costs a lot of gas obviously.\nWhat I typically do in my contracts is call with a restricted amount of gas, and if the call fails then force the transfer by wrapping with WETH and sending, which probably costs even more gas.\n\nBy comparison, PAY seems a million times better, and it may even take a step towards helping solve some gas observability issues because restricting gas for simple transfers (probably the most common form of gas observation) won't be as common a practice.\n\nSo I agree, seems like a no brainer and low hanging fruit to make good progress, with or without EOF.",

        "content": "Yes you are right, this achieves the same, but it is expensive. Selfdestruct is 5k gas, and in order to load the cold from this \"utility contract\" we need to add this contract from cold to warm addresses, which is an extra 2600 gas. And there is also the small overhead of setting up the calldata for this utility contract (use calldata to determine which address we want to send to). \n\nI'll have to run this as an experiment but I think this utility contract way is about twice the cost than performing a normal CALL. (This includes setting up the CALL to the utility contract and the overhead). Tbh this is less than I originally expected. But this is also not something which we would consider to market, because selfdestruct is deprecated, and if we would hardcode the utility contract then we must be sure that the contract is not created in the same transaction (otherwise the code gets deleted and the eth sent there is in most cases lost)",

        "content": "We should also include PAY in Osaka because of EIP-7702. Via PAY you can circumvent the extra gas costs which are spent if you try to transfer ETH (so with no intention of running any code, just transfer the ETH) to a 7702-delegated account. Previously EOAs had no code, so 0 gas was expected to be spent there. With delegated accounts, the accounts have (delegated) code, which thus means that code will be ran and gas will be spent. Even if we explicitly don't want to do this, since we only want to just transfer ETH.",
