        "content": "that's a good point. The reason for seeding comes from an adaptation of an activation behavior that was meant to use block numbers, to the timestamp-based system. We don't need it on mainnet since 2935 is activated in Prague.\n\nGajinder correctly raises the point that it might be different on testnets since the Osaka activation could happen within 8192 blocks of Prague, presumably when Prague is activated at genesis and Osaka a few slots later.  \n\nBut if Prague is activated at genesis, then there are no previous block hashes to copy. I don't think any other use case (e.g. Prague and `N != 0`, and Osaka at `M` with `M-N \u003c 8192`)  would be relevant to testnets, so we could get rid of this initialization.",
