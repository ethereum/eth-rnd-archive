        "content": "While not strictly RLP `0x` is often used in for example `eth_call` results to denote `NULL`: https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_call. In fact the `DATA` type from the JSONRPC \"HEX value encoding\" section lists `0x` as a valid representation of an empty result.  So if you're decoding JSONRPC request/response data `0x` is valid (as is other odd strings like `0x0` instead of `0x00` for quantities, a lot of code (mine included) conflates that into accepting `0x` as a valid empty RLP rather than properly having separate JSONRPC-HEX and RLP encoder/decoders.",
