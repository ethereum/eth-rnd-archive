I notice (as you warned 😉 ) that the propagation times graph on bdnexplorer does not display currently \u0026 the actual values reported are also zero.  I will follow conversations on the bloXroute discord to see when the data is available again. Certainly sounds awesome to be able to gather propagation information from so many nodes!",

Basically, nobody moved to the next template within 50 ms, but 20% moved within 150 ms, etc. I then further broke it down to individual pools\nIt's a nifty analysis, if I may say so on my own work",
