Previously, a bumped gas could not be \"fixed\" from the outside by simply \"moar gas\", since gas can be restricted internally. However, oil gives us a way to \"add moar oil\" from the outside, since it's global.\n\nSo we'd introduce \"oil\" into transactions, then we could start adding penalties which effectively cause any trie access to cost e.g `3000`. But `700` from `gas`, and `2300` from oil. For the penalty-case: If the trie access was legit, then we can give back the `2300`. \n\nI think the oil is an awesome idea. Has anyone written it in a more formal specification, so that it may be EIP:ed ?",
