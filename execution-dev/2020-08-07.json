I know that the initial distribution of ETH is hard-coded somewhere, but I can't seem to find it in the (geth) codebase. The best I've found so far is in this repo: https://github.com/ethereum/pyethsaletool/blob/cab1c9d8ca27f5e86a9eb36a2a56915f5f7830d1/genesis_block.json",

I really want to be able to trust this initial genesis state, and show to others that it can be trusted.\nThanks!",

This is embarrassing IMO and I wonder if we should try and get clients to implement a `getSupplyAtBlock` endpoint that we could write reference tests for to make sure it is consistent. Obviously the state root would be different if clients had different account balances, but having an easy way to expose it would remove the need to write scripts on top of the clients.",
