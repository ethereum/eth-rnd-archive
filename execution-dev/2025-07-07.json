I think all EL teams are deferring adding partial blob responses, so we're just postponing extra coordination effort to the future to make it happen. Would it not be better to just implement it now and forget about it, putting it behind a request flag to avoid serde costs while unused, [as originally proposed](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/669)? That way the CL can begin using without additional coordination / releases needed from EL clients",
