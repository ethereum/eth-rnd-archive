        "content": "\u003csandJohnson\u003e Hey everyone, I am keen to hear your opinion on how block propagation time is, or should be, defined / calculated. I have a dataset which has metrics for several nodes distributed globally. For each block I have the first observation time at any of the nodes, and then the time difference between the first observation and the arrival at the other nodes. Would you say that propagation time is 1) the time difference between the first observation and the observation time at each of the nodes, or 2) the max time difference between the first and last observations of each block? (I realise that these values are only an approximation of propagation times \u0026 that I do not have the time it takes between the miner \u0026 the first observation, but the latter should be negligible). Any comments are very welcome! Btw anyone know how ethstats.net calculate their propagation times? 1) or 2)?",

        "content": "sandJohnson: Try to define propagation delay as a time distribution and then give measurements for percentiles. Less technically this means, give time for the 50% percentile, that is when 50% of your nodes have heard the block, and then go for 90% (when 90% of your nodes have heard the block) and 99% (when 99% of your nodes have heard the block). You can also flip that on its head and give a percentile number, that is how many nodes have heard the block after 1/2/5 seconds delay. https://tik-old.ee.ethz.ch/file//49318d3f56c1d525aabf7fda78b23fc0/P2P2013_041.pdf has a paper on how Christian Decker did those measurements for Bitcoin years back.",
