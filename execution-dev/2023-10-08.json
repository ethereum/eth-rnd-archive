I'm working on https://github.com/ethereum/node-crawler. I'm having trouble connecting to nethermind nodes. The RLPx handshake seems to work, ~~but when I send the hello packet, I never get a response.~~ Edit: Looking at tcpdump, it looks like nethermind closes the connection straight after the RLPx handshake. With some nodes, I get a disconnect response, that they have too many peers, but the other nodes which don't send back the hello packet, I'm trying to figure out how to get it to work. Is there someone who can help me debug? We can set up a time now or tomorrow or whatever.\n\nI have a node running on my own network. It's not synced yet, not even connecting to peers. For some reason, this one works. I get the hello response and I can even do the status exchange, but for some reason, I cannot get this to work with any other node I try to connect to.",
