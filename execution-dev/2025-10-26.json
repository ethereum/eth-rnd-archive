There is presently no Extension node in this trie.\nCould a 1-nibble (0x1) Extension node have been set to compress the common high-nibble of transactions 0x10 and 0x11 (+ child branch node for low-nibbles)?\nWe would end-up with an extra node and path-empty leaves, and the rootHash would be modified!\nIs there a node compression rule addressing this trie malleability? Thanx!",
