I would prefer to fix this in an engineering way long term than in a solely economics way or a mix of both if required, but would certainly give priority to engineering first.\nHaving said that I think the simplest approach right now that allows us to scale is the best option, which is to track state incentives gas separately with a simple cap.\nMaybe some old timers have more context, what happened to state compression/archival solutions?",

ZK definitely doesn't solve it.  State rent would, but I haven't seen that taken seriously for like a decade.  State expiry would potentially solve it, but last I checked that requires address space extension which was still a non starter.",
