The only one I can think of is that it would increase the operational cost of attaching ETH to a transaction/call and people don't seem to like gas cost changes very much.  Are there other reasons it would be bad?",

        "content": "would logs also be generated for \"implicit\" moves like validator withdrawals and block producer tips, or only inside \"normal\" txs?  if its only for normal txs, maybe this should only work under a new tx type?  My main rationale for a new tx type is that it ensures this is an opt-in change, as I can envision suddenly getting `transfer`-like events for ETH could break some processes.  Also a new tx type makes it very clear which txs would have these added to their receipts, otherwise it feels like there's more room for corner cases (e.g. what if tx A is first mined before the fork but then reorged out and into a different block _after_ the fork, would it now have these events when it didn't before, etc.).\n\nanyways I definitely agree that _even if_ the log produced _happened_ to look like ERC20 `transfer` logs the EIP that proposes this should have its own format specified.  Also it might be worth getting the polygon/bor team's input, as IIRC they inject \"implicit\" events like this in their L2 (not transfer events, IIRC the events are more related to consensus changes) and I'm sure they have feedback on what did and didn't work well there.",
