Even though I designed the EIP to be \"drop in\" so there is little modification to TX logic, only adding the module(s), it is still quite beefy (several hundred lines and the whole algorithm trait).\n\nAlso, Ed25519 was quite literally the first algorithm I thought of, if anyone here has a better / easier algorithm for testing I'd be happy to use that instead.\n\nOnce [EIP-7980](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9940) goes through I'll finish the [EELS PR](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/1292) and get started on EEST, then I'll propose them for inclusion.",
