However this doesn't seem the case. If I `EXTCODECOPY` then it will add the target address to warm addresses, but it will not touch the account. I wonder how other clients have optimized this: it now seems I need to track 2 separate journals, one for touched and one for warm addresses (+ warm slots)",
