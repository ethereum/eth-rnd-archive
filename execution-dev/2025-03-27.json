        "content": "Hello team! I'm Minhyuk from Sunnyside Labs, and we're currently running multiple devnets to identify bottlenecks in PeerDAS as we prepare to increase the blob throughput. You can see our previous reports in [03/11](https://testinprod.notion.site/Sunnyside-Devnet-Updates-03-11-Internal-1b38fc57f54680a9a409d639a8a45bdd?pvs=74), [03/18](https://testinprod.notion.site/Sunnyside-Devnet-Updates-03-18-Internal-1b98fc57f54680d991c3f7a4fefa590b), [03/25](https://testinprod.notion.site/Sunnyside-Devnet-Updates-03-25-Internal-1c08fc57f54680339b2fe2dbc8232b6d). \n\nWe're currently mostly working with the CL team, but as we're involving more EL work into PeerDAS, I imagine more analysis into EL impact would be required. We'd love to get your comments and thoughts about what sort of metrics or test scenarios that you'd like to see in the future devnets regarding peerdas and blob usages (and any other useful tests)! Looking forward to helping the roadmap in any way!",
