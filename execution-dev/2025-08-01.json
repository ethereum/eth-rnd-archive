Should I send the results here or a specific channel in the nethermind discord?\nI remember that about 2 years ago, I reported an issue on the nethermind discord where the nodes with \"too many peers\" was closing the connection before sending the \"too many peers\" message. So I have a special case in the crawler to mark the closed connection after hello for nethermind nodes as \"too many peers\".",
