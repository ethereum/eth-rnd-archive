        "content": "Posting about gas limit increase once again :P: I have been monitoring mainnet for a while - and this is how much my Erigon+Caplin node spends in each phase of executing a block (initial 4 secs of slot). Most of  the \"Network latency\" is most likely just timing games as this node in the US where most validators are. this means that execution+consensus overhead is pretty much \u003c10% when it comes to actually processing a block. This means that from a processing perspective there is lots of room to grow.\n\n**NOTE:** this is Erigon with a new chain tip performance improvement which pretty much tripled out performance on the tip of the chain so not sure if all clients can get exec that low - compared to geth it should be slightly faster.",
