        "content": "Yes, that is the problem, I cannot know at any one time who could potentially be mining, and that is not really something I need to know for the prior distribution. I would like to know, historically, the proportion of nodes actively mining. I thought I could have a  look historically for account public keys that have received mining rewards. Does that make sense, or can you suggest another approach? My aim is purely to get an idea (somehow) of the percentage of nodes actually mining. I realise that this changes daily and only having the miner flag switched on does not mean active participation as a miner, but I am trying to find some way of estimating the proportions. Would really appreciate any thoughts \u0026 suggestions",
