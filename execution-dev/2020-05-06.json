My question (probably ill asked) is assuming I don't verify all the way the state in the back ground, could I keep up with the upcoming state updates?)",

Let me rephrase to be sure: Assuming I'm at the tip of the chain, one could store the 256 block in memory, dumped the latest block on the HDD and verifed the upcoming block in memory. Therefore, one could do exploration of the chain (from a certain point) without the hard requirements to run on a SSD (re @tkstanczak: I think that the stateless client with a  witness download and beam sync for the latest 256 blocks or so can run entirely in memory and is just a few steps away.
