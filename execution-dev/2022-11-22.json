Can someone explain what ethereum/tests is used for versus this repo? Is ethereum/tests being deprecated and is the intention to rewrite the filler tests in python or to just move over the generated tests?",

During a testing discussion in bogota several other people were interested in experimenting with writing new tests in `execution-spec-tests` repository because it allows us to much more easily write tests that require programmatic generation (which is many of them). \u003c@892053833121923094\u003e has been leading things there and has been ironing out the test filler program. We don't really have any plans right now to rewrite the existing test yaml/json fillers. It will likely just be that new tests will be written here instead of `ethereum/tests`. But also very likely that both coexist for awhile.",
