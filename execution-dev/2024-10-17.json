There are teams building solutions for this in Rust, Golang, Javascript, Java, and Nim.  There was a comment in ACD about \"Portal being far away\" and I want to be clear that is not the case and that the solution is here and ready now.\n\nI recognize that prioritization of this is difficult with all of the other competing priorities... but it also seems that disk usage is a meaningful issue effecting your users.  Prioritizing this seems like one of the things that will have a meaningful long term impact on your users **and** it seems that not prioritizing this continues to stand in the way of important protocol things like the current blob conversation.  How can we solve this collective action problem and get 4444s prioritized across execution clients.  What would it actually take for your team (execution client teams) to make this a priority and to start work on it?",
