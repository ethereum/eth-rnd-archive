        "content": "Geth people, a question to you.\n\nTalking about the recently discovered difficulty adjustment algorithm flaw. TL;DR it is exploitable as you can artificially lower the block timestamp to have *a bit* higher difficulty and thus be able to have a higher TD. That gives an ability to make a single-block reorg on top of the blockchain for no cost no matter when you actually mined the block and cause other miners' block to become an uncle. This is a massive problem as malicious miners can steal high MEV blocks from other miners and improve their uncle rate while suffering honest miners' rates.\n\nSuppose more and more pools incorporate this to defend against F2Pool attacks. In that case, it will cause the mainnet difficulty to quadruple and increase block times by many times, significantly damaging the UX.\n\nI think it can be fixed easily by just disallowing single-block reorgs on top of the current chain. Would a fix like this introduce issues?",

But there is a cost, you have to actually mine a block on top the n-1 block before another mine n+1, and dont necesary have more reward (fees or mev) than build on top of n(the natural form to do)",
