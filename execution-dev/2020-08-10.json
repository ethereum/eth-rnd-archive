My name is Camilo Gómez, I'm from Chile, and I was invited here by Jakub Vysoky (we are both contributing to the drand project). \nI'd like to ask the following: currently we are using the ethereum blockchain to contribute for our public randomness service Random UChile. For that purpose, we have been running a `light node` in our servers (we don't have the necessary equipment to run a full node). From time to time, we are experiencing a `no peers available error`, that we think it's because we can't find a full node that \"accept\" us. Is there a way to ensure that our `light node` will always be available and functional? For now, we are using the light node only to retrieve the last block available in the blockchain.",
