Optimism just removed their whitelist, StarkNet is live etc\n\n...and L2 transactions still cost $10, restricting usage to a small subset of people.\n\nthat breaks the narrative. if we wait till we have a perfect story for data expiry to assauge long-term concerns about full-node disk usage, in the meantime we might bleed dapp developers and users to competing chains.",
