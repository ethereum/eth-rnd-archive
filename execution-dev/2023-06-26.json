It seems that geth implements it as scalar int, and Besu is getting disconnected with this error `invalid message: message msg #8 (157028 bytes): invalid message: (code 8) (size 157028) rlp: non-canonical integer (leading zero bytes) for uint32, decoding into (eth.NewPooledTransactionHashesPacket68).Sizes[0]` \nI think it makes sense to use scalar int so checking if the EIP needs an update.",
