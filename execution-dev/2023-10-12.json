        "content": "So geth 1.13.3 added a new log warning about `Announced transaction size mismatch` (see: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28261).  However this seems to be trigger a _lot_ (this host has logged that message 120458 times in the last 2h) so it seems like something we should track down the cause of.\n\nTo assist with that I just collected the `peer` field from the last 2h of `Announced transaction size mismatch` logs on one of my 1.13.3 nodes and then used `admin_peers` to check my other nodes if they were connected to this one, and here's the client ids I was able to acquire using that technique:\n\n```\n   5     name: \"Nethermind/v1.20.1+9f39c0c7/linux-x64/dotnet7.0.9\",\n   2     name: \"erigon/v2.48.1-stable-674b77f0/linux-amd64/go1.20.6\",\n   2     name: \"Nethermind/v1.20.4+d06ec791/linux-x64/dotnet7.0.11\",\n   1     name: \"erigon/v2.50.1/linux-amd64/go1.20.7\",\n   1     name: \"erigon/v2.43.0/linux-amd64/go1.20.2\",\n   1     name: \"erigon/v2.43.0/linux-amd64/go1.20\",\n   1     name: \"erigon/v2.43.0-stable-1106475e/linux-amd64/go1.20.4\",\n   1     name: \"besu/v23.7.2/linux-x86_64/openjdk-java-17\",\n   1     name: \"Nethermind/v1.20.3+e8c161a5/linux-x64/dotnet7.0.10\",\n   1     name: \"Nethermind/v1.19.3+e8ac1da4/linux-x64/dotnet7.0.8\",\n```\n\nI find it surprising that three different codebases (Nethermind, besu, erigon) would all have the same issue, anyone have more insight into what might be going on here?",
