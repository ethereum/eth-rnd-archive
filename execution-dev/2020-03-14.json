So for a time, you have two layers of tree, much like what docker does with with file system trees, each layer stacked on top of the next.\nSo in practice, you have two storage spaces, which can use whatever layout the client is comfortable with, even if I like the  (Key,Value) store idea best. The hope is that the top layer should not grow too fast, and can therefore be re-inserted quickly when the conversion of the base layer form hex to binary is over.",
