I guess there's no way to avoid this but wondering if once a chain is downloaded by one client if it can be transformed to the format expected by the other clients? And if that might be a project worth pursuing?\n\u003c@!387536747476549632\u003e I'm a bit late on this, but I have a branch of py-evm which can read from Geth's database format, so you can use Trinity against a Geth database. I also have a script which goes a step further and imports a geth database, turning it into a database which Trinity can run against. One problem with the idea is that importing a Geth database into TurboGeth is going to take a very long time, and It would probably take a lot of effort to make a version of TurboGeth which can operate against a Geth database, it almost ruins the point of using TurboGeth 🙂",

I know you can import geth blocks in besu, for instance, but it still means you need to run two full databases. The only saving is that if you already have a geth node you can export from, you don’t need get all the blocks from the network directly.",
