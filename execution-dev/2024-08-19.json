So I find it somewhat unnecessary to allow \"junk on the chain\" (as you stated yourself) if it is possible to catch this one step before (when I am looking at our implementation, it does not complicate/bloat things but instead the check just moves from b (execution) to a (tx validity).\n\nSo I would have a slight preference to move this check to tx validation.\n(if there is no reasoning I am not aware like \"keeping things more flexible for - cross-chain ? - use cases or whatever)",
