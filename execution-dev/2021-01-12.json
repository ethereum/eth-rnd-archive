Is this still the case? Are witnesses going to be created for each block or is there still the possibility of creating transaction witnesses?",

There's no unified plan so I can't say with any certainty how things will work, but everybody in that thread seemed to agree it makes sense for each transaction to include a witness for the account which will pay the txn fee. This will be used to prevent attackers from flooding the network with invalid transactions. I don't remember any changes to this agreement since that post.\n\n\u003e Are witnesses going to be created for each block or is there still the possibility of creating transaction witnesses?\n\nThis question seems to be asking about something different! The linked thread is about proving the sending account has enough eth to pay for the txn. This question sounds like it's asking about the rest of witness. We had previously agreed that transactions would not have their format significantly changed and miners would create witnesses for each block which clients could use to validate blocks. Recently there's been some discussion around asking transactions to include the entire witness necessary for proving themselves. I don't personally believe that transaction-attached-witnesses are workable but there's been some motion in that direction.\n\nDoes that answer your question?",

What is the time implication for a client updating the proof before sending it to peers? Apart from the fact that I cannot understand how a transaction proof can be valid and out of date 🤔",
