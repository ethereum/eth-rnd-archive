Seems like most current core devs believes the merge is a more beneficial step to take rather than focusing on those aforemention EIPs. On the other hand, if anyone does wish to push that EIP forward to the core devs and is willing to take the time and effort to see it until realization, then you may see some success in getting those implemented.",
