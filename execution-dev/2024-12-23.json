In this case you could make getProof a lot faster by storing all trie nodes but then you use a lot more disk (and have other challenges with handling that much data). I like giving users the ability to pick a client that makes trade offs that match their needs.",

Generally op-node is very paranoid about its source node because there’s been plenty of wrong responses received from various api providers and nodes for different reasons. As you move more to light nodes being able to prove responses are correct becomes more useful as well.",
