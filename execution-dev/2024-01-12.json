It has repercussions on the CL where change or regimes can be triggered if blocks start arriving at 4 seconds. Testing worse case execution times is a fine measurement, testing for state growth as well. But I'd argue that we also need to consider the propagation times on the CL, the economics of targeted reorgs, the interaction with blobs that themselves increase block latency, etc. This is a much more complex problem than simply \"checking the worst case scenario for an execution client\". In addition, as \u003c@415548822983278593\u003e has been pointing out regularly, increasing the gas limit has interaction and is in some way a competition to increasing the blob count. If we stick to a rollup centric roadmap and data costs continue being the bottleneck, perhaps increasing the blob count is the way to go.",
