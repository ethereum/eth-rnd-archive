This channel and entire server is mostly for technical talk between people working on eth1x. \n\nAugust 2021 probably refers to the London upgrade/hard fork, which is mostly about EIP-1559. See https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-updates/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40timbeiko%2F1559-resources for details on what it does.\n\nWork on \"The Merge\" (i.e. swapping the consensus protocol of the Eth chain from PoW to PoS) is underway in a more exploratory fashion. Check out \u003c#692062809701482577\u003e and \u003c#826479341784662056\u003e if you're interested in keeping up with developments on that front. No definitive timeline yet for that, although Q1 2022 has been given as a rough estimate to miners for their ROI calculations.",
