The benefit is that the transcript has timestamps, so you can get the video link if you really want to review what was said, and of course by outsourcing to neural networks outside of my own skull I saved quite a bit of time and headache meticulously transcribing 90 minutes of conversation... \n\nhttps://notes.ethereum.org/@afhGjrKfTKmksTOtqhB9RQ/HkIjiJKUL",
