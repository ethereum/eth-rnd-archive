Miners already have huge setups, so it seems to make sense to have them be stateful to while the rest of the network isn't.",

Until I wrote the post on ReGenesis my line was always that miner-produced witnesses were the only viable solution (due to the Dynamic State Access). However, the big downside of it is that the cost of witness sizes (collected by the miner, but mostly existing to prevent DOS) needs to be apportioned to individual transactions - and that leads us to various proposals for repricing opcodes, or adding Oil etc. When thinking of ReGenesis, I understood that having the growing \"active state\" as a backstop for incomplete witnesses should mostly mitigate the concerns about Dynamic State Access, and make transaction-level witnesses viable. This mitigation was not possible in our previous design, where all block witnesses are isolated from each other and there is no backstop for incomplete witnesses. Transaction-level witnesses allow us to charge tx senders for witnesses directly, so no extra apportioning is needed, and a huge chunk of work for Stateless Ethereum (gas repricing and/or Oil) falls away",

For example, if you have all the blocks in the blockchain, you can compute the state, but not vice versa. However, having the state in \"materialised\" form allows you to make queries to it in O(log(S)) time, where S is the size of the state, whereas if you have only blockchain, your queries would take O(B*something) time, where B is the size of the blockchain. This point of view can also clarify the terminology around \"archive\" nodes. Yes, all blocks in blockchain allow you to compute all the historical states, but if you want to actually query them, then \"unrolled\" history lets you do it in polylogarithmic time rather than in superlinear time and space.",

        "content": "Developing better terminology requires more fundamental understanding of algorithmic complexity of transforming some type of data into the another, as well as the complexity of querying it. Another part where complexity theory can help is the notion of computational integrity. For example. Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum, has a state, which advances (and also mostly grows, though not as fast) with each block. It is implicit - it is implied that anyone who want to validate a Bitcoin transaction needs access to that state. The only way to compute it is to run all blocks from Genesis. You could download/copy it from someone else (which I am sure people do within the same company), but you need to run all the blocks through it to verify. In Ethereum, the commitment to the State at each block makes it possible to download/copy State and then verify, so IMO it is a more flexible design. That, of course, skips the proof of computational integrity which you get when you run everything from the start. So the arguments of what is \"secure\" can be reduced to whether proof of work can be used as a substitute of computation integrity. From the first sight, the answer is \"YES\" for Ethereum, and \"NO\" for Bitcoin. But then, you look at optimisations in Bitcoin Core that are skipping very old signatures because of the overwhelming Proof Of Work, and, with SegWit, that allows the actual cleaning of the disk space too (because old signatures can be removed, since we are not bothering to check them again and send it across the network). And you see that under this lens, it looks like Bitcoin Core implementation started to throw some of the computation integrity away for the sake of better efficiency",
