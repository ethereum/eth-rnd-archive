I've a question regarding the `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` endpoint. \n\nBy looking at Geth code I've seen that block building is triggered only when the payload attributes are provided, and uses only the head block hash from the FCS (reference: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/4cda8f06ea688cc3e523ee1e35425393ecad807c/eth/catalyst/api.go#L430-L438). \nCould block building be done in a separate endpoint like `engine_buildBlock` then?",
