I feel like they are working more on gas optimizations than distributing the Sequencer, simply because that's what their users want: cheaper transactions. For example, according to their medium article, the upcoming Arbitrum Nitro upgrade improves just execution speed and transaction costs. Maybe if there was some sort of eip-4488 agreement, they would instead focus on distributing the Sequencer?",
