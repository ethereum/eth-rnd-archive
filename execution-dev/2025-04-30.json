So people can start using it immediately when Pectra goes live (takes overall 8,191 blocks (including the fork block number) to fully populate the history). This oracle is deployed in a `CREATE2` approach using my contract factory `CreateX`; so anyone can go and deploy it on other chains once Pectra is also activated there. I have documented all the details here: https://gist.github.com/pcaversaccio/64c7829e0c7ed4eeb1e5a07e2177836c. This is good use case of an EIP that fits into user needs btw.\n\nYou can already test it on Sepolia if you want\n```\n~$ export ETH_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia.rpc.subquery.network/public\n~$ cast call 0x0e04bDF212088405D1EF8abE507F644a87c17a84 \"block_hash(uint256)(bytes32)\" $(($(cast block-number) - 1337))\n```",
