        "content": "I'm not sure if this is super correlated, but a Flashbots recently released the ability for miners to include \u003e1 MEV transaction bundle in blocks. FB basically moves auctions for arbitrage opportunities out of the general txn pool and into a secondary one where only the winner's transaction ends up on chain. This is partially what led to a big reduction in gas prices earlier in the year, because non-MEV users were no longer competing with these arbitrage bots for block space + only the winning txn (vs. a ton of failed ones) made it on chain. \n\nWith only 1 bundle per block, you can imagine that auctions for the 2nd+ highest MEV transactions in a block still happen in the public txn pool, again raising gas prices. If all auctions of MEV are removed from the main txn pool, that can reduce gas prices.",
