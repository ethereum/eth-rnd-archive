We have `GAS_PER_BLOB = 2**17`, `TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK = 393216` (`3 * GAS_PER_BLOB`) and `MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK = 786432` (`6 * GAS_PER_BLOB`).\n\nI wonder why in 4844 we did not remove `GAS_PER_BLOB` and instead used `TARGET_BLOBS` and `MAX_BLOBS` params? (Plus an update to the gas calculation to deal with integer arithmetic). \u003c@543900561460822016\u003e knows maybe?",
