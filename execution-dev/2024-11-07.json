        "content": "I had a crack at implementing an EIP4788 verification proof generation and verification for the BeaconState. \n\nDoes the leaf index need to be enforced by the smart contract verification?  \n\nFor example:  I want to prove a particular value in the BeaconState (`finalized_checkpoint` has  value `epoch`). A user can provide the epoch and a Path to the BeaconRoot but my concern is they could provide any value and a path to the root and it would pass verification. My workaround to this was to enforce the leaf index value. Is this a valid approach?\n\nAlso can the leafIndex for the `finalized_checkpoint` , `epoch`  change based on other values in the tree? e.g. new validator deposited\n\nCode here: https://github.com/rzmahmood/beaconstate-proving-kit/blob/main/smartcontracts/src/FinalizedCheckpointTracker.sol",
