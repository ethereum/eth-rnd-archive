        "content": "Hey all, I am slightly confused. I am pushing for https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7610 [Revert creation in case of non-empty storage] because this fixes something which is not in the spec yet (this amends EIP-684 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-684, Revert creation in case of collision).\n\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-161 this EIP is about state clearing and states that accounts with zero nonce, empty code and zero balance are empty/dead. If these are \"touched\" then the account is cleared from the state trie. This thus means that an account is also empty if it has zero nonce, empty code, zero balance, and non-empty storage (!).\nDoes this imply we have no accounts anymore of that type on Mainnet? Since https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7523 is now part of the Mainnet spec since block 14049881 (or just stating it is active since the Merge, which is also true), this seems to be the case.\n\nWhat confuses me is that it adds a rule to EIP-684 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-684, Revert creation in case of collision). But since when is this EIP actually active on chain? It is not part of any of the hardfork meta's. And CREATE2 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) seems to depend on it but does not require it officially in the EIP. So I think formally this is not (?) part of the spec (?). Or: one could also state this can be applied retroactively from Frontier/Chainstart. But if this is the case, then we should create a Meta EIP for all EIPs included (retroactively in case of EIP-684) from Frontier/Chainstart.",
