There might be some routing information you could deduce from those numbers. (re @sandJohnson: Hey everyone, I am keen to hear your opinion on how block propagation time is, or should be, defined / calculated. I have a dataset which has metrics for several nodes distributed globally. For each block I have the first observation time at any of the nodes, and then the time difference between the first observation and the arrival at the other nodes. Would you say that propagation time is 1) the time difference between the first observation and the observation time at each of the nodes, or 2) the max time difference between the first and last observations of each block? (I realise that these values are only an approximation of propagation times \u0026 that I do not have the time it takes between the miner \u0026 the first observation, but the latter should be negligible). Any comments are very welcome! Btw anyone know how ethstats.net calculate their propagation times? 1) or 2)?)",
