I just rebased the eip-6780 branch with self destruct tests on main and refactored them to run on the new version of execution-spec-tests. It's still a work-in-progress, but it should be easy to pick up work on these tests again. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! \n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/122#issuecomment-1623472474",
