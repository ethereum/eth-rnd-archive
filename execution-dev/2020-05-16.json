I (and others) have been telling people for *years* to not limit gas to calls and that gas costs can change up or down over time.  Some people *ignored* that advice.  I don't think we should punish everyone because those people ignored the advice.",

We will however continue to develop Oil proposal for a bit, and also use it as a \"case-study\" for testing a new EVM semantics. One thing I will say in response so far is that it was under my influence that we have separated Oil proposal from the \"Witness pricing\" theme, because I though it would make it less clear. I still believe that even without the context of Stateless Ethereum, researching and developing oil helps elucidate lots of fundamental things about gas, and why certain things were a design mistake. In the context of Stateless Ethereum, oil is mostly the result of the desire not to try to apportion the charge for the witness across various opcodes, but instead decouple it from the instructions, and make the block witnesses be as much independent from the specifics of EVM as possible. Eventually, I think we might even deprecate gas as it is",
