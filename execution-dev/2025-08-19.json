I'll describe the other uses below but they are kinda irrelevant for my question. As far as I can see from that contract, it verifies the signature and simply creates a consolidation request with the two 48 byte pubkeys obtained from the calldata and the execution address which was verified from the signature. Then the EL does not care at all on what the CL does with that consolidation request. Is this correct?\n\nFor context, the CL does the following validation today: it checks that if the two pubkeys are the same then it transforms a 0x01 validator into a 0x02 validator. I want to add a new check in that if the second pubkey is of the form 0x0N00...00  and the first pubkey is a 0x0(N-1) validator, it will convert it into a 0x0N validator. This allows to onboard immediately any existing validator as a builder if they control the withdrawal credentials.",

We can have any sort of API as long as it extends the current established one, and reinterpret the 96 bytes of the calldata however we want. \n\nI get the feeling that for the EL this would be much better than adding new request types, dropping a new contract on the EVM, etc. I feel we have this machinery already in place and it should be safe and trivial to use it on the CL for free now",
