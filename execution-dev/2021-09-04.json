        "content": "quick question. if we assume the merge \"just\" happened, we can assume that most validators (at least today) are not going to be running enhanced MEV algos ... so my point is a bit of a question / statement . what would be  the default geth (for example ) behavior  if set loose on the mempool? As i suspect it just start at the highest gas priced transactions and just work its way down until we are at 1 gwei and pay no attention to if the blocks are using 30MM of gas over and over... (just being throttled by the base fee).   so while 1559 is great, post- merge we may see some bumpy behavior as the mempool i expect to be drained. what i am unclear about is how the execution clients default behavior responds (as i am not a miner and have no reference) since all validators are about to start proposing blocks, knowing that default behavior should provide some guidance of what we will see right after the merge",

What transactions are eligible for inclusion and which ones aren't, and the mempool size.. I don't think the merge affects these things in any way",

        "content": "that is the question to which i am hoping for more clarity. i assume it will be different as we will then have a distributed pool of validators and i suspect that most will not have any MEV running or algos to optimize transaction selection (this is the heart of what i am really asking). today we see blocks using 30MM of gas followed by some that are zero. While i have no evidence i suspect those are pools trying to optimize the 1559 impact to not have full blocks over and over.  as far as the assumption the merge occurred today, it is purely a scenario analysis and hypothetical. clearly it can't happen today.",

That has again little to do with 1559. (Note that you need a _really_ high value bundle for it to make financial sense to do this, like many ETHs worth, see https://notes.ethereum.org/@barnabe/rk5ue1WF_ )",
