        "content": "Hey folks - Some open questions and pain-points against EIP-7002. Have any other app-layer teams hit some of the same pain points when developing against 7002? Namely:\n\n1. The current fee is not queryable via the predeploy (there’s not a getter in the predeploy, or meainingful code for a Solidity reference impl). \n2. The calling conventions for these predeploys is a meaningful deviation from typical EVM calling conventions. We’d use a 4-byte function selector to signify which method to call instead of relying on CALLDATASIZE. This might have been discussed, but it is not well documented in the EIP. \n\n^^ More detailed / and with context here: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7002-execution-layer-triggerable-exits/14195/20\n\nIt might be too late for any types of change, but clarity on the use-caase or alternatives would be helpful, at least to roll back into the EIP. Thanks!",
