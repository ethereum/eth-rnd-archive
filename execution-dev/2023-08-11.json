        "content": "Hello,\nI have a doubt over RLP encoding and decoding in transaction.go (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/types/transaction.go#L102)\nCurrently transaction struct only has `inner` as another element which is being encoded. What if transaction struct had two fields (e.g. `inner1` \u0026 `inner2`)? How exactly would encoding and decoding would work?\nWill we need to encode them one by one and while decoding also one by one or some other approach?",

        "content": "Yes that's where my doubt is. The custom encoding method for EncodeRLP is called encodeTyped() which writes tx type and then encodes tx.inner(rlp.Encode(w, tx.inner)). So if there's an inner2, can I simply do rlp.Encode(w, tx.inner2) right after encoding the inner1?",
