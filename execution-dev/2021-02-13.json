        "content": "Basically what you try to avoid in a system like that is an immediate *complete* devaluation of all of the 'state' (i.e. book value of a given article), because it leads to an immediate equivalent decrease in your P/L (which from a steering perspective is usually undesireable). so by applying a gradual/smooth transition dependent on the movement frequency, the immediate impact on your P/L is less severe. partially active in this case therefor means a reduction in value of state over a given time period (e.g. every 12m from 1$-\u003e0,5$-\u003e0,25$-\u003e0,1%-\u003e0$). physically though, the stock is always on stock until it's worth zero.\nit's a bit over the top over my head whether in our context here a state between 1=active and 0=inactive serves any additional value for the given purpose of reducing state bloat",
