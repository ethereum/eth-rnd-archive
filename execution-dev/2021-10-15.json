However since the\n    # bomb has no effect prior to block 200000 we pretend it existed from\n    # genesis.\n```\nIs anyone who was around in 2015 able to confirm/correct this?",

The question here I believe is whether there is anything wrong with just pretending that change was in there from the start, or if it would work just fine from a consensus point of view.",

Additional verification would be found if they look at the subsequent commits between genesis and the release prior to block 200000 and see that it was added.
