        "content": "Hey 👋 A short update on `Paprika`, the experimental storage for Nethermind. https://github.com/NethermindEth/Paprika\n1. in a synthetic test it was able to process 1 million of small blocks, without growing the dataset (non-archive mode). This proved that the idea of a db run in-situ, of course if state is only updated. For the new it will still allocate more. But the future with no pruning looks promising.\n2. readonly snapshots/transactions are implemented now. This means that if a sync or any other reader wants to pin the history at a given point of time, it can easily do it.\nAll the work is captured in the open, using GitHub Project https://github.com/orgs/NethermindEth/projects/39. The current milestone is to get it working as it. The Merkle construct (and potentially aligning it with Verkle) will be tackled in the next milestone/month.\n\nThis is R\u0026D so statements above can be invalidated in any time 😅 . In any case, if you're interested please take a look at the repo. The design is captured and constantly updated in the design doc. https://github.com/NethermindEth/Paprika/blob/main/docs/design.md",
