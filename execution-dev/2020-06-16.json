Re snap -- it has now moved from \"proof of concept\" into actually doing a robust, concurrency-enabled protocol implementation, with all bells and whistles + testcases surrounding cornercases and malicious peers. It doesn't matter what format (binary or hexary)  the backing trie has, but the ability to \"heal\" a non-complete trie with the use of fast-sync (getNodeData)  is an important final step",

I'm interested in a broader conversation about how that call can be re-invented so that it suffers less from this slow \"attrition\" or tragedy-of-the-commons problem that I personally experienced where the call felt a little bit like \"theatre\" where I was on-stage with the implicit ask to make decisions in a public setting where it didn't feel entirely safe to have a candid discourse. T\n\nTo state that in a different way, the call seems to try and serve two different purposes.  1) a medium through which we can make decisions about the core protocol 2) a public \"town-hall\" ish where the broader community can both see how the decisions are being made as well as have their voice heard.\n\nThe problem I see is that the \"town-hall\" element exists to the detriment of the decision making since I personally feel like anytime I speak up in that call I'm on stage for the world to see and thus, it isn't a safe place to test out ideas, debate things, etc.  I don't know how best to address that problem, but I think if we can address it then we can potentially get broader participation on the call and in theory more easily make better decisions.",
