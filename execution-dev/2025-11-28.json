        "content": "As the number of blobs going to increase in 2026, we gonna be spending more and more time in the engine api decoding base64 encoded json of blob data. Currently based on measurements of \u003c@857052906495017000\u003e they take about 300ms at current 6/9 target/max values. Its going to increase lineraly, so just for the sake of potentially unlocking future scaling, I'd start pushing to rearchitect the engine API. I think it would make sense to use ssz for this. This is not really glamsterdam focused work, nor does it need to be consensus related, so parallel work on this can be done. Its a trivial change for all CLs, but it would be a significant work for EL devs. Please comment if you disagree with any points.",
