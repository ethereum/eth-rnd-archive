I believe that to bump credential type you would just need to send a request with two equal pubkeys as it is today and then N can be turned into N+1 on the CL side e.g. 0x02 -\u003e 0x03 -- so we basically need to add that CL part into ePBS changes. The target for consolidation requests is 1 per block today, so the fee will start growing if we have more than that. But I believe there won't be a constant load with tons of requests to update to 0x03; it is likely there will be a bunch after the fork and that's it.",
