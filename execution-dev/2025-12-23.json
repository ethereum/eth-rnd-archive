I’ve been digging into AA design trade-offs (EIP-4337, native AA directions, validator/proposer interactions, and wallet security models).I’m currently interested in private Account Abstraction specifically privacy-preserving user operations, mempool leakage, bundler trust assumptions, and potential designs using ZK / encrypted mempools / PBS-aligned flows.\n\nIs anyone here actively researching or prototyping private AA? Would love to sync notes or learn what directions people are exploring.",
