(Small change, but will need input from other team as this changes logic, who is best to ping on this?)",

I replied back on GH -- you bring up a good point in favour of merging re: risk mitigation.\n\nIn your msg, can you confirm that the *unit test* is for the code that would eventually handle V3? (note that you don't need to add that code now -- this change is a no-op for CLs if V2 is still returning all-or-nothing). and by \"rough edges\", are you referring to the laxity in behaviour as per V2 on master? if yes, I 100% -- I think this is tech debt, that's why I'm keen to merge this PR",

Which is a fairly minor annoyance to be fair, and tilts towards merging to add the extra version. /But/ I think the risk is so well-scoped and unit-testable that CL teams could choose to accept it to keep things simple. \n\nSo how I would frame this from the CL side is: if all teams think they can easily be confident in the safety of leaving v2 as is, I say we keep it simple. Otherwise, merge this pr and add the rough edge to the spec and implementation so we can just punt it out of fusaka.",
