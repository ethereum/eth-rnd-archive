I want to ensure that no similar ideas have been proposed in the past and to gauge interest before I write the EIP.\n\nto make it short - the solution is a decentralised firewall, part of the execution client, that analyses every transaction for potential hacks. It leverages the EVM to make reverting transactions as transparent and decentralised as possible.",
