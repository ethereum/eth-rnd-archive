They are part of Drand network (https://drand.love/) and so is EF Devops team. Let me know, who do you think would be the best candidate here ;)\n\u003e Camilo Gomez (UChile)  8:03 PM\n\u003e Hello Jakub. We're from Random UChile, a randomness beacon that uses external events as randomness sources. We know that you work at Ethereum Foundation, and one of our sources is the Ethereum blockchain.\n\u003e We have a couple of questions that we want to solve. Can you help us by providing us some advice in a couple of issues that we are having? Maybe you can give us a reference of someone who can help.",
