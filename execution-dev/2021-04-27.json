We had a long AllCoreDevs call about this early march 2020, and I think a lot of the sentiment expressed there is probably still accurate. Also, with The Merge coming, it just doesn't make sense to spend time working on tweaking the PoW algorithm.",

But there's a deeper reason: When ASICs decide to attack, it's actually not very likely that the value of the chain goes to zero. If you look at past attacks, that's never how it bears out, often the drop is actually surprisingly small. However, the developers and users of the chain will probably change the hashing algorithm since current ASIC miners cannot be trusted, and so the ASICs still become worthless.\nFor GPU miners, you can't do this: The same GPUs can still be used for the new mining algorithm. \nSo in essence, it's a bit like proof of stake, in that you can \"slash\" an attacker and take away their investment — but this only works with ASICs, which are specific to the algorithm, and not with GPUs",

I haven't looked at past attacks and their effect on value whether they were GPU or ASIC attacks though. Assuming ASIC miners do not hold their ETH and are pure profit seeking then there is a 100% chance they will attack. I would suggest at the very least increasing the DAG to 5gb a few months before the merge as that kicks off some ASICs but not all ASICs while not affecting most GPU's. That will lower the threat of ASIC action during the merge.",

I think we probably want to make this explicit in the transition spec somewhere. \n\nAlso, it's worth noting that most chains that get attacked basically have no usage and likely aren't \"priced\" as secure. I suspect a serious attack on BTC or ETH would have a larger price impact than BSV or ETC given that the former are considered much more secure.",
