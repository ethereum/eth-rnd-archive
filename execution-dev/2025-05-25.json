We seem to be so far away from having execution being anything of a bottleneck on L1 that these things may be irrelevant from now. But I can't fail to see the double standards though. If execution is irrelevant then parallelization is an early optimization that complicates consensus for no reason. If it's actually needed then the RPC provider point comes back to be valid)",
