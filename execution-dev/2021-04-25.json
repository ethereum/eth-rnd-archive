And some staking pools will offer returns greater than staking by yourself when you consider not paying for hardware costs and mev income. Most of the pools participating in mev likely have plans to continue come 2.0. MEV is currently 2-5% of miners incomes which seems small during pow but could be a huge income come 2.0 in comparison to the 5% annual. The largest 2.0 pools are all looking into mev now.",

MEV is going to lead to a few large pools dominating the network or possibly even just 1 pool holding 51%.
