The second network is used to propagate (or gossip) transactions, new block headers, new block bodies, and block witnesses. The third network is dedicated to syncing to the current full state. This model, if applied exclusively, does not work for Beam Sync, because Beam Sync relies on the on-demand state access within the p2p network. Currently, on-demand state access is used to implement the initiall state sync, which is believed to be a sub-optimal way of doing it. Therefore, Beam Sync (and other applications requiring on-demand state access), would need to either rely on the legacy network (which mixes downloading, gossip, and on-demand state access), or build a separate network for on-demand state access. Currently, Light Client Protocol (LES) is aspiring to create an insentivised network to provide such on-demand state access. If a free (meaning non-incentivised) on-demand state access network continues to exist, this might impede the ability of LES to gain any serious adoption. An opinionated way forward is to eventually remove on-demand state access from the free networks, because it is not strictly required for improved resiliency. Anyone can still acquire any piece of state if they wanted to, but they might need to join the initial sync network for several hours and stay there. Alternatively, they can pay and get data immediately via LES protocol.\"",
