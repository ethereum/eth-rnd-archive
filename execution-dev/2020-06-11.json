My initial thought is to just have a wrapper around transactions like:\n```\nrlp([2^256-1, TransactionType, [...]])\n```\nWhere we could create wrapped legacy transactions with something like:\n```\nrlp([2^256-1, 1, [nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, senderV, senderR, senderS]])\n```\nThe idea here is that the 2^256-1 first element is a sentinel to ensure that a new transaction can't collide with a legacy transaction since `nonce` can never be anywhere near that big and they should overlap enough that we don't have to worry about collisions.  Is this necessary?  Does it in fact prevent collisions?",
