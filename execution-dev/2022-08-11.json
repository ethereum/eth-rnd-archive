Eventually you need to move core parts of the roadmap that ecosystem partners were promised into testing and production (and have a long testing phase like for the merge). Kicking the can down the road with \"a quick basic HF for just withdrawals\" means there isn't enough core dev mindshare in the next 6-12 months for these hard but important upgrades, and hence they never materialise beyond theoretical discussions (6-12 months later there will be yet another quick but basic HF requested and the hard problems postponed again)",

Adding additional complexity with significant protocol changes on top is likely to result in a far less stable result, and we need to tread carefully at the start.\n\nI don't think that anyone is losing sight of the fact that there is a lot of execution layer functionality that we want to bring in as soon as possible, but I don't think that equates to it having to be in the first hard fork after the merge.",
