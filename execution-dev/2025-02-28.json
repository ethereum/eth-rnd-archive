The Pectra upgrade will add more blobs to each block, but it won’t really help use the space better. This feels important to fix because it could help users pay less for blob transactions and make nodes need less storage. \n\nI wrote a research article about it (https://ethresear.ch/t/blob-aggregation-step-towards-more-efficient-blobs/21624) and would love to hear what you think! Should we solve this outside the system with additional actors like blob aggregators, or work on changing the main protocol to allow dynamic blob sizes? Your insight would mean a lot to me!",
