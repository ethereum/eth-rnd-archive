On EIP-4444, when it refers to checkpoint sync, the way I understand it is that we would download a snapshot of the state at the checkpoint to avoid having to run txs since genesis. But it doesn't mention where to get that state, would it be from the Portal Networks state network? And this network is still on planning phase so it's not possible to build this functionality yet? Thanks in advance",
