    "content": "In a post BAL world, since the EIP changes account access gas semantics (essentially making it a two level check for code vs nocode), the EIP document could use some more clarity on when an account is marked as accessed in the BAL.\n\nFor example, say a call tries to access an account which has code. The call has enough gas to pay `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE=500` but not enough to pay `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE = 2600`. The account still needs to be included in the BAL as accessed, since we have to load the account first to find out if it has code.",
