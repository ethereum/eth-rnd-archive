But this seems to be a specific problem here because we cannot charge the right amount of gas before actually loading the account. For other other access patterns, this does not happen, right?",

    "content": "We have two options: \n1. Only load the account if there is at least `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE` available. That way we prevent DOS attacks and make sure the address is only in the BAL if it is actually accessed\n2. We check if the user can pay for `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` before loading the account. If after loading, the account has code and the suer does not enough gas, we stop execution, charge the max available and still assume the accoutn was accessed (i.e., it goes in the BAL and in the warm addresses). This is not as good for DOS, but maybe better for users as reverts are more predictable",

    "content": "Another point that I came across is that there seems to be a bit of a circular dependency in the EIP when it comes to zero value transfers.\n\nAccording to this [table](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/fb847de2fa6ae290c6a9ae078b2f4e5d39cce110/EIPS/eip-2780.md?plain=1#L268), zero value transfers to an EOA do not charge any access gas while zero value transfer to a contract charges `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE`. But we cannot tell whether an account is an EOA or contract without accessing it.\nI think zero value transfers to an EOA should be charged at  `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` for cold access",
