    "content": "Thanks. The edge case might worth checking although it should be critical even if getBlobs fails there.\n\nI've asked for two reasons:\n- on FCU we move to the blob to limbo, and then we don't serve it with the current getBlobs implementation. We could though, if needed.\n- after FCU, i.e. once the tx is on chain, we will not request the transaction, even if we missed it before and we receive an announcement for it. This is a change I'm introducing, and was wondering if it can create issues for you.",
