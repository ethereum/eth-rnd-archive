    "content": "Yes also notice that for deposit contract, this was deployed \"normally\". For the system contracts, there was a synthetic address generated (no one has the pkey) and a specific chain-agnostic tx which would deploy the contract at a specific address (part of EIP). So deposit address is likely to change. I haven't checked but likely the deposit transaction is likely only possible on chainid=1. So on other chains, if it is not predeployed at the same address, it must be deployed at a different address. So the system contract addresses are part of the EIP spec (although its obv. fine to configure this also 🙂 )",
