Besu is deterministic in which block it will pick in case of equal total difficulty (part of a proposal to fix this in clique that hasn't been widely adopted) so resyncing a besu node won't help. \nThe other option is to bring a validator that's been offline back online but not sure if we have any of those at the moment.",
