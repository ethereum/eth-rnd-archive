Users give unlimited unrevokable access to whatever tool they give their private key to, limited only by the code of the tool.  3074/7702 without in-protocol cancellation the user will give unlimited unrevokable access to whatever tool they authorize, limited only by the code of that tool.  The only difference is where the code runs (on chain vs off-chain).",
