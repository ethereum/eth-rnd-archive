Messages are usually propagated reasonably quick via gossip, the degree in the mesh is 8 and with the much smaller number of nodes/peers in sepolia in comparison to other networks(mainnet, goerli) , any blocks should be propagated pretty quickly across the network. If block propagation times are highly varied across different nodes, it is likely that there is some other cause rather than an issue with block gossip",
