We plan to move over to using this new environment after the bellatrix upgrade but before the  actual merge happens (between sep6th and sep 10th). My question is , can we still continue to use our current nodes that has just the EL- geth (no CL) until a few days before the merge actually happens  and then switch over to the nodes that runs CL and EL?",
