In theory, PoS rewards target a security threshold, they don't target an inflation rate.  Now, that security threshold is incredibly hard to calculate (maybe not realistically possible), but I don't think this means we should necessarily just \"target something else\".",

        "content": "I'm having trouble finding documentation on the format of a raw signed transaction.  Is source code of a client the only documentation on such details?  I can see, for example, in [EIP155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md) that a raw transaction turns out to have a certain header, then the RLP-encoded transactions comes after it and I suppose a signature comes after that, but I can't tell exactly how all the pieces are concatenated.  Any pointers would be appreciated.  (Books like Mastering Ethereum don't get into such details.  I'm not a Go programmer, but I've been studying enough of it to read the go-ethereum source code.  I'll eventually get my answers on my own, but any help to speed me up is appreciated.  Thank you.)",
