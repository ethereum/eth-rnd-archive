        "content": "I made a graph for the *tx witnesses vs block witnesses* discussion for ReGenesis, in which I look at how close the gas_used by a transaction is to the gas_limit as a proxy to how good users and dapps are at predicting gas costs of a transaction. Most important graph is the cumulative distribution, where you can see that about 40% of transactions have a ratio of 1 (i.e. gas limit == gas used). These could be ETH transfers, which always cost 21000, irrespective of the state, which I didn't exclude. \n\nSome caveats on the assumptions: \n- The is a weak incentive for dapps to be accurate, i.e. the displayed tx_fee is lower if gasLimit predicted is lower, which is good for the dapps (especially when gas prices are high)\n- There is a strong incentive to exaggerate your gas limit since a gas limit too low could lead to the tx reverting (e.g. unpredicted state transitions). \n- Many of these transactions may not come from dapps or regular users, but from automated bots that don't care about over estimating the gas_used\n\nNevertheless, studying what overestimation margin dapps tend to use would be a good approximation for the uncertainty in state transition dapps and users face, which could give us some idea of the % of transactions that would fail because of invalid tx witnesses, at least at the beginning of new state extinction events.\nhttps://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/HTJwBqZ121gz5roUC3kAfz0FLRhELlorfNYY2rWx",
