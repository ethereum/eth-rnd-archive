Appreciate any EL team feedback on \u003c@520034910149410861\u003e's comment below when you have a moment 🙏  thanks!\n\n\u003e About the EIP, the main thing is deciding how to specify p2p acceptance around fork boundary, which I think is for EL clients to decide, I just don't have the necessary context: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9378#discussion_r1995407802",

We break down its supposed benefits and argue they're more \"nice-to-haves\" than essential upgrades. Instead of adding complexity, we highlight cleaner, less disruptive solutions that achieve the same goals. EOF’s objectives are solid—but there's a smarter way to get there.

        "content": "Thanks for this write up. Has there also been some research done by anyone about the community response of EOF? Especially the removal of gas introspection (in particular how much gas we can forward to the next call) is something which some developers might dislike.\nAnd a second side-question, if we have EOF we still have legacy EVM. Via EOF -\u003e Legacy EXTCALL we can still make use of \"banned\" things like just reading the gas opcode. At some point we would likely want to get rid of \"legacy EVM\" because it has deprecated opcodes (selfdestruct and callcode), are there any thoughts on this yet? Is it even feasible/practical to do?",
