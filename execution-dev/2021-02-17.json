        "content": "\u003e To be precise, is the technical limit on increasing transactions per second, [...], it makes the DAG growth 100% larger, making some computers unable to process this? \nIt is not related to the mining process no. Miners don't store the chain as far as I know; the pool operator does. Any bit of additional verification by miners could even be considered wasteful overhead.\nSo the problem/challenge is that it is currently needed to have all the state stored to verify transactions. If you can't store the state (not enough disk space on fast enough drives), then you can't verify blocks/transactions anymore.\n\n\u003e If so, this seems really unworkable — 14 transactions a second isn't just difficult or impractical, but outright defective as some international currency based on this dependency of hosting the DAG or state.\nWell, sure, I don't disagree. But everyone has to make some trade-off between decentralization, scalability and security ( https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ/8bd293c39391af2f489a8cf431bb85724e3f1baf ). There's plenty of offerings out there that have much greater scalability than Ethereum, by reducing the decentralization and/or security. The people in the Ethereum world are generally just not willing to give (much) up on those two to gain scalability. Also, accomplishing all three is not necessarily impossible, but very difficult. The stateless proposals can help, as can L2 options, as can client improvements, as can making state obsolete with revival options (the links I included earlier).\n\n\u003e are \"roll ups\" \"layer 2\" \"lightning networks\", etc that avoid transaction limits (fees) on the main ETH network essentially the same (in a mathematical, logical sense) as this:\nThey don't avoid transaction fees, they're just lower. The rollup still has to post proofs to the main Ethereum chain. The trust level is very different from central servers, as are the ramifications if trust is broken. So no, rollups are very much not like that.",
