        "content": "There is a proposed method for controlling state growth separately from compute, such that the price for state creation specifically reflects demand for it. It has the benefit of also providing a more accurate price for compute, such that both resources can be consumed at their targeted levels. This is EIP-8075, which differs from EIP-8011 in that it tracks state creation over time. It can be noted that 8075 requires us to add new header variables to track state creation.\n\nOn ACDT on Monday we will make a decision between the 8075 approach and the 8011 approach for 8037 (or, presumably, to not do any of these approaches). Currently, 8037 is speced with the 8037 approach, but it can rather easily be swicthed, as it mostly pertains to the pricing method. \n\nYou can think of the base fee as the currency of the Ethereum nation. \n8011 tries to adjust the value of the currency to ensure that neither state or compute is overconsumed. 8075 further sets the relative price between state and compute to ensure that both can be consumed at their targeted level. This is not a guarantee that 8011 can make. To control state-growth, 8011 instead relies on the 8073 idea to double the gas price of state for every doubling to the gas limit. The assumption is that if the gas price for state increases by 5x, then users will consume 5x less state relative to compute. If this assumption is wrong, state gas could crowd out regular gas, impeding scaling.  As more data comes in, the exact encoded relationship would be adjusted in future hardforks.\n\nIt should be noted that the 8073 method would be required also if we skip both 8011 and 8075. That is to say, the complexities we are dealing with do not go away by just not doing anything. Rather opposite, the seriousness of an incorrect assumption increases. Thus, applying 8011 still brings about scaling gains, but not in as a reliable and principled manner as 8075.",
