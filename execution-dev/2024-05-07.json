        "content": "Hello everyone, it's a pleasure to meet you all! I'm really excited to be here and I deeply appreciate your help. I have a question regarding the Eth Beacon Node API. Specifically, for the GET request at /eth/v1/beacon/rewards/blocks/{block_id} which retrieves block rewards, could someone kindly explain what exactly the returned value represents? For instance, for slot 9018848, this API call returned 44783891, yet on the beacon, the MEV Block Reward is listed as 0.03368 ETH (https://beaconcha.in/slot/9018848), and the other data appears quite different from 44783891. Thank you so much for any insight you can provide! 🙏",
