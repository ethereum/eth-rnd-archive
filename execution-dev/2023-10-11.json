The Teku Detailed dashboard has a chart for this, https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/16737-teku-detailed/. I've added a histogram of execution payload processing time to my local version of the dashboard - I ought to publish it as it's quite insightful.\n\nIn addition, when Teku has failed to process a block by 4s into the slot, it will print a `Late block import` line with timings of the various components. The `execution_payload_result_received` timing is how long the block spent being validated by the Eth1 client. You can also see if the block was received late, `arrival`.\n\nEdit: should clarify that this is all for Teku  😃  - sorry, though I was on our channel, not here 😂",
