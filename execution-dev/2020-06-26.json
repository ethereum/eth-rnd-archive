I think that place should likely be the README.md and other docs in the stateless-specs-repo, so I added the tech tree and edited the README to reflect that in this PR: https://github.com/ethereum/stateless-ethereum-specs/pull/43 -- it still likely needs some work so if you have any suggestions for resources, content, or anything else, please jump on that PR or contribute 🙏 😄",
