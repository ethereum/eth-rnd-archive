Is there a new proposal or consensus on what these should be?  Talking with \u003c@758579010027782144\u003e it would good to get these changes in ahead of the next devnet",

The current discount table makes for a fairly flat distribution of costs, they are just individually offset above and below compared to ecrecover.\n\ne.g. original discount table, with `multiplication_cost` of 29_000 for g1 msm and 40_000 for g2 msm.",
