So even if you fetch the block headers backwards from a new head using the `reverse` flag to reduce the likelihood of the chain being led astray by a malicious peer, most of the synchronising work - fetching block bodies, execution, database updates - will be done in the forwards direction anyway.",

The missing bit for me was that the getblockheaders message already supported getting blocks in reverse in a batch rather than going block by block for a single hash at a time.  Makes total sense that we don't need to bother with a separate forward sync strategy now.",
