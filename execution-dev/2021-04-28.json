I have a question on this: https://notes.ethereum.org/@n0ble/rayonism-the-merge-spec\nand whether these 4 RPC calls  (using the `consensus` namespace) for eth1 block formation are here to stay, and if they are not, I am wondering if you could point me to a resource of what inter-client communication will look like for eth1 block formation?\n\nI'm asking this in the context of thinking through Flashbots' MEV-SGX spec in eth2",

        "content": "The reason behind these calls have been implemented on top of existing JSON-RPC machinery is simplicity and faster speed of implementing them in frames of Rayonism project. While the semantics of messages/methods will likely be preserved in production, underlying transport protocol may be different, also, method and param names could be changed as a result of polishing.\n\nSo, I'd say you may assume semantics preserved and make no assumption about the form of this communication channel. Also, if we consider a bundled client design where both layers live in a single software then these calls will be implemented as internal API calls initiated by consensus layer and addressed to an execution facade.",

        "content": "This is accurate until you include the fact that all these asics are getting bricked soon anyway. In the next few months many GPU miners are going to be edged out of the network as profits go down - less efficient hardware (I.e. all GPUs) is not worth using. This is already happening as gas is so low and will accelerate with 1559 coming and difficulty going up with more super efficient asic farms coming online every day. Hashrate will become centralised. ASICs are predominantly built and operated in the far east and we know this. And as already stated by others in here ASIC miners have the greatest incentive of all to reject the merge with 2.0 as they can't just mine another coin afterwards. They are a group with very little to lose as they are dead when we merge with 2.0 anyway. It's a short term risk with a proposed solution that is way off in the distance",
