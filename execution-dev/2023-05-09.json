I'm trying to use those same bootnodes in erigon (which seems to otherwise have trouble peering on Sepolia)  but even after waiting a bit I'm not seeing my erigon node pickup any devp2p peers (I'm using an external CL so am getting blocks just fine).  Does erigon require erigon-specific bootnodes?  I see the original sepolia bootnodes for erigon were added in this PR (https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/pull/3462/files#diff-c13a1b5c84048a832e07e3503cc35f66614816cb39fe1e2fdd992672a9e1d883) but I can't find those enodes in geth's history so not sure where they came from.\n\nAnyways, if anyone has suggestions on a) some working Sepolia bootnodes for erigon and b) a possible PR to erigon to help make things easier I'd be happy to help on said PR.",
