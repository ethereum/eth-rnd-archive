        "content": "Hello!\n\nI’m from the Nethermind team, and I’ve been working on the project you visualized. Great work! The idea of comparing clients from an external perspective is excellent.\n\nI have a small comment regarding our test suite and interpretation of the data. In our test cases, the focus is primarily on identifying the worst-case scenarios for the client, rather than simply measuring how many operations are faster in a given client. It would be very interesting if you could add a simple table showing all clients and their worst-case performance. \n\nOne of the most important comparisons is tip-of-the-chain block processing on the mainnet. You could run all nodes on the same (identical!) hardware (very important to make sure that IOPS are identical) and measure the time for engine_newPayload. We’ve recently started conducting such comparisons internally and have developed some tooling around it. \u003c@1009418255913472000\u003e can share the details. However, it would be fantastic if someone outside any client team could perform this analysis.",
