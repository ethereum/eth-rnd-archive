I think we might see something like this every once in a while, but basically because a group of people decide to act against their own self-interest and it works out anyway.",

They are actually very different models. From a pure code perspective https://github.com/vulcanize/eth-contract-watcher does the vast majority of what subgraphs do, but just using a TOML file instead of writing typescript. BUT we don't offer any free service, we didn't go through a huge community bootstrapping. we just wrote it as part of the grant the EF gave us for open source block explorer work.\n\nVulcanizeDB is a framework/collection-of-tools that together allowing someone to develop and deploy their own third party verifiable cache/index of _any_ ethereum data, it's not limited to Events, like Graph Protocol is.\n\nThere are many advantages to using vDB over TheGraph, I think the main one is we can use vDB to index contract state without emitting events, which are expensive.",
