We want just about everyone to be able to validate transactions/blocks themselves. Note that there is also work underway on this front (some hinting at \"super nodes\" that are indeed much more powerful, but don't require deferring validation/trust). Still mostly in the phase of how to best address it in the short-term, mid-term, and long-term: https://ethresear.ch/t/alternative-bounded-state-friendly-address-scheme/8602  , https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/02/14/why-stateless.html .",
