        "content": "Question: What happens to `block.number` (i.e. `NUMBER` opcode) if a proposer misses their slot? Does it still get incremented for the nonexistent block meaning the first block after this miss will be `block.number + 2` or is it not incremented unless an actual block was proposed?\n\nWant to know whether `block.number` can be used as a proxy for timestamp post merge i.e. does `block.timestamp = (block.number - merge_block) * 12 seconds + merge_timestamp` always hold?",
