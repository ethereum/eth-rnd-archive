I've been trying the \"el-testing\" channel earlier but that seems no good for this, and now trying here, just to see what's the response rate and figure out preferences.\n\nTopics of interest that I'm aware of:\n\n1) EL discovery, improvements, improvement proposals, etc. (we have done a few changes recently in Geth and plan to do more ... maybe worth sharing experiences and syncing. there is also the question of discv5 vs discv4)\n\n2) devp2p improvements: there have been new versions, but adaptation is still low. There are also some new proposals to explore:\n- I'm working on a few proposals\n   - extending announcements with sender address and nonce for better pull performance\n   - adding cell-level bitmaps and partial pull\n- proposals to separate type3 tx from sidecar are also in the works\n\n3) mempool improvements: we have various sharding and partial diffusion related proposals in the pipeline.\n\nI would be of the opinion to create a single dedicated channel for all these. To me it seems like a good middle ground between using this channel and having too many channels .... let's call it el-networking ?\n\nWhat do you think? Ideally, we would need an interested dev (also a point of contact) from each EL team.\nGeth: \u003c@857052906495017000\u003e , \u003c@194432762315407360\u003e \nBesu: maybe \u003c@741651225576996935\u003e ?\nOthers?\n\nI guess \u003c@277500722655002624\u003e is also interested, and also \u003c@795439202732867594\u003e from EF P2P.",
