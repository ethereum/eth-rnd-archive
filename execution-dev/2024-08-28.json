It will be fairly easy to convert these to state test format, and I'm planning to do this.\n\nEverything is looking okay so far with one exception:\n\nRight now, the Geth team is leaning against tuning precompile pricing to the performance of a multi-threaded algorithm for the MSM precompiles as it steals extra unpaid execution time that the client could otherwise use.  Benchmarks of Geth on my machine (linked in the README of the benchmark repository), show that when provided with random inputs, G1 MSM is underpriced by around 33-50% vs the ecrecover precompile with concurrent execution disallowed.\n\nI'd be curious how other teams feel about the gas schedule of MSM precompiles, and whether or not they should be tuned to the performance of multithreaded algorithms.",
