        "content": "when testing besu on kintsugi and devnet4, if we stop the clients for some period of time and then restart, the CL will do an optimistic sync and get \"way ahead\" of EL.  Then for each block/slot behind we are, we ask the network for the resulting gap, one block at a time backwards.  \n\nOur thinking is that at some threshold of blocks behind, it would be more efficient to instead do a forward sync from peers which have the latest finalized block, stopping at the latest finalized hash/block height.  \n\nI am thinking worst case, we could be led astray by a malicious peer up to the block height of the latest finalized block.  And best case we would reduce the p2p request traffic and time to sync significantly.  Thoughts?",
