Though, Prysm and Lighthouse were still asking for logs of a deposit contract premerge. But this was confirmed by the teams to be a cosmetic thing and they dont realy rely on it to fully sync. This was all done by our QA Engineer Colleague \u003c@436137413686067210\u003e . Feel free to ask him any questions",
