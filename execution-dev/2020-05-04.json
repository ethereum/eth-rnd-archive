        "content": "Hi, I've got a pretty noobish question.....  Why **exactly** can't ethereum sync without an SSD?\n\nExample: I've got plain-vanilla default `geth` running on a machine with a 3- HDD raid 0 setup, and while I failed to configure geth (I literally invoked it as `geth` and saw \"oh, it's working\" and walked away a few days ago) properly when I started it to ensure that I could check its status, my logs be like:\n\n```\nINFO [05-04|08:57:36.653] Imported new state entries               count=700  elapsed=3.485ms   processed=225903592 pending=16554  retry=0   duplicate=83131 unexpected=224779\nINFO [05-04|08:57:37.568] Imported new block headers               count=1    elapsed=3.726ms   number=9998217 hash=3f867f…28fe24 age=1m5s\nINFO [05-04|08:57:38.530] Imported new state entries               count=1084 elapsed=5.970ms   processed=225904676 pending=15678  retry=0   duplicate=83131 unexpected=224779\nINFO [05-04|08:57:40.222] Imported new state entries               count=1014 elapsed=4.481ms   processed=225905690 pending=16477  retry=69  duplicate=83131 unexpected=224779\n```\n\nSo I assume it's still syncing.  Guess I'm hoping for a precise answer instead of the kinds of answers I might get if I asked on Twitter.  \n\nThank you!",

Once the sync part is over, going forward the node will be fully validating blocks, which as described above requires an SSD.\nTL;DR yes.\nNow, full statelessness is another matter, since presumably witnesses are small enough to be kept in RAM (they're on the order of a few megabytes per Ethereum block last I checked, with work on reducing that size).
