Not much further research is required, just need to figure out the details on compatibility.\n- Will completely get rid of proof computation in CLs and ELs (perhaps except the broadcasting EL node?)\n- However it does couple DAS into EL, but seems like a manageable trade-off for most?\n\nI don't know too much about the EL sharded blob mempool, but if we do end up implementing vertical shards (was the preferred option discussed during devcon), it seems like we'd need to have the cell proofs in the ELs anyway? and the pre-compute logic in the CL may become obsolete. \n\nAre your concerns mostly on coupling DAS logic into the EL?",

Is there any guarantee that public blobs tx will reach every EL node?",
