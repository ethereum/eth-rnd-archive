        "content": "Hey everyone, I have recently started writing my MSc thesis on the Quantum Threat and Ethereum, but currently i am still writing my research proposal. I will be analysing the current cryptography methods that are used in Eth and see how one would be able to make the network quantum-safe by integrating the appropriate post-quantum cryptography methods (e.g. the four finalists announced by NIST and potential other ones that are relevant). After this, i will look at technological barriers for implementation (compatibility, trade-offs etc.), while also looking into organisational obstacles (soft/hard fork). Is there anyone in here that can give me some advice/guidance on this particular topic. Thank you very much!!",
