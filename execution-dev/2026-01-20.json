        "content": "Concerning header variables, it would in my mind be a strange design to track state gas but not actually use it. If we are going to track state gas, we could just as well use it to achieve full scaling and target state utilization, instead of relying on guesswork that may see us fail to scale. The only valid reason we opted to not do EIP-8075 was because we did not want to add header variables. So I would at least personally find it weird to add header variables but not having the protocol make use of them to actually achieve some desirable state growth and guarantee L1 scaling.",
