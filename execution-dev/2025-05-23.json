I know first hand that when Arbitrum started looking into better pricing for Stylus that enabled a lot more computation than the EVM, they looked into paralellization. The problem was that some operators are already fully parallelized and would actually be hit hard with such a change. Now on the L2 world where only some nodes are needed to be running and the percentage of RPC-serving nodes is higher and are already running fully paralellized, it makes sense to not make it cheaper to run in paralllel. On L1 in principle I could see why the situation would be drastically different, but still I believe RPC providers should be part of this conversation",
