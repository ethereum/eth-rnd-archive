    "content": "Hi all — quick FYI from an execution‑specs audit pass: the typed‑tx decode path accepts non‑canonical RLP integer encodings (e.g., encoding 0 as 0x00). Clients reject these as invalid RLP, so this is a spec/tooling divergence (not a consensus split), but it can yield invalid fixtures or misleading t8n results if malformed bytes are ingested.\n\nSpec context (Prague): typed tx decode uses ethereum_rlp.rlp.decode_to(...) without enforcing minimal integer encoding; signing hash paths in transactions.py (e.g., signing_hash_1559) will accept the decoded fields. A strict check rejecting leading‑zero integer encodings in typed‑tx decoding would align with client behavior.\n\nIf helpful, I can point to the exact file/function locations.",
