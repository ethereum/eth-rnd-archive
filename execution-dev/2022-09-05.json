I don't see that randomly selected keypers are though. How is this any different from say randomly selected committees in PoS? Crucially, tx encryption means that even if a builder centralizes, they can cause less user harm with toxic MEV and less network harm because they can't meaningfully censor txs (it's all or nothing)",

We do plan to switch over to the node running both EL (geth 1.10.23) and CL (lighthouse 3.1.0) by end of this week and ahead of the merge but wanted to make sure we are fine to go through the Bellatrix upgrade wtih just the EL running . We are running geth (1.10.21) atm. Appreciate you comments on this.",
