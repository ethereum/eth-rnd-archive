They could agree that the strike price would be:\n\n- the median of medians of the preceding 300 blocks (~1h worth of blocks). \nOr:\n- sort all tx's in the preceding 300 blocks. Sum up the gas used across all of these txns = `total_gas`. Keep a rolling sum of gas used starting from the lowest transaction until the `rolling_sum \u003e total_gas / 2`.  Take the gas price as that of the last txn you processed. This would effectively give you the median txn gas price weighted by gas used.",
