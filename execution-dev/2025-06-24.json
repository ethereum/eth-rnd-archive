PTAL and let me know what you think.\n\nMain changes are:\n- sequential storage of like-types, e.g. all headers, then all bodies, etc to support range queries. although the downside of this is the index gets bigger\n- added `Proof` element to store beacon / block proof so everything can be verified if a user has a trusted beacon root from some point in time\n- changed receipt format since (AFAIK) most clients don't actually store the true 2718 format - so this should be much more optimal for client usage\n- block index changed to support multiple offsets for each block. just read `count` and `component-count` from the end of the file, then you can jump to the exact offset for the component you need\n\nhttps://hackmd.io/@matt/H1H9QUlNgx/edit",
