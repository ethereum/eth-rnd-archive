The only place where such change can be done is via the blob_schedule array. (which might or might not be the same as the fulu fork epoch.)\n\nSo I'm asking once again, not to have the requirement to add future named EL forks in the blob schedule field as it is a field that will be redundant, and just make it super prone to have a mistake. \n\nComplex scenarios that are prone to having issues:\n\nimagine a base network that has went through osaka/bpo1 but not bpo2, and you want to have a shadowfork where you want to trigger amsterdam, but want to unschedule bpo2 first, as you don't want to test blob schedule change.",
