I also have a script which goes a step further and imports a geth database, turning it into a database which Trinity can run against. One problem with the idea is that importing a Geth database into TurboGeth is going to take a very long time, and It would probably take a lot of effort to make a version of TurboGeth which can operate against a Geth database, it almost ruins the point of using TurboGeth 🙂\n\u003c@!296630428754771968\u003e I just went through the script. Thank you! This is great 🙂 Do you know long does it take to do a full import of geth db?",
