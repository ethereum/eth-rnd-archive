Is it the same as for 3047 that it is a must or not? There is definitely a trade-off to be made between functionality and in-protocol revocation. A clear position on this would help steer the discussion it.\n\nhttps://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7702-set-eoa-account-code-for-one-transaction/19923/1",

If we were to do max nonce we also need to open the discussion of how to actually bump the nonce more.\n\nI do think we should have a NONCE opcode so contracts can opt-in to using nonce as a revocation mechanism",

All EOA signatures evaluated by the protocol have some sort of an \"expiration\" because they are all over a nonce.  DeFi does other things, but that is all in the EVM layer.  Eternal in-protocol authorizations for an EOA account are a new and significant problem.",
