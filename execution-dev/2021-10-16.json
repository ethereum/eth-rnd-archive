The different kinds of sync do very different calculations.  Erigon did archive mode sync (no pruning) in 3 days 3 hours on the same system.  Erigon took about 1.5TB when it was done, but it's up to 1.7TB now (both numbers rounded to nearest 0.1TB).",

We at Erigon could (and probably will) make a mode to download current state along with the history. It will be archive, but the sync will be literally as fast as your internet connection.",
