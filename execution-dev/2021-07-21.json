If I see real interest in it, I will come up with a better solution. In terms of SLA, I think 95% would be reasonable to expect: my Internet connection can be flaky. I can also share the database by request: ~8.1 TB.\n\nThe node is available by this URL: https://ec453b92cd8c.ngrok.io/\n\nHere is an example of an API call:\n\n```\n    $ curl -s --data '{\"method\":\"web3_clientVersion\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -L https://ec453b92cd8c.ngrok.io/ | jq -CS\n    {  \n      \"id\": 1,  \n      \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",  \n      \"result\": \"Geth/v1.10.5-stable-33ca98ec/linux-amd64/go1.16.3\"  \n    }  \n```\n\nTo follow updates: https://deni64k.github.io/eth-archive-node/",
