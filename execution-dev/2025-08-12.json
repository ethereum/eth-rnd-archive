You can build bots that do this, but that is beyond most users.\n\nWallets could have a sweep option that submits a new transaction every block, but you need keys live in memory for that (not transiently decoded or only on a TPM that requires user input to access).  Also virtually impossible to do this with a hardware wallet.  You also would have to bump the gas price each block to deal with replacements I think.",
