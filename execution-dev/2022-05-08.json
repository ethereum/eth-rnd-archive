        "content": "Pawel is suggesting to have EL2 offline and being fed by EL1. I am not sure that this may work in all cases as EL2 should also be connected to the network to be able to sync from scratch or whenever any data is missing and EL should catch up with the head it receives from CL.\n\nIn this scheme CL is having a logic which reads block validity statuses from both ELs and makes a final decision on whether to attest to a block or not. IMO, this logic is better be implemented as a middleware -- having this kind of tool widely adopted would reduce the probability of consensus breaks which is great. I guess the idea behind Pawel's proposal is the same",
