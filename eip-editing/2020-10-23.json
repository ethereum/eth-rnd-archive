A week past the announcement, a PR to EIP-1 is submitted to add new/renamed statuses https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2996",

It's not a blocking  objection, I'm just not seeing any need for the Review and Living statuses.  Because it goes against the editors \"original intent\" of a simple, linear process.  And, as a practical matter,  drafts are always subject to review at their  discussions-to links. \n (Unfortunately this EIP-1 draft has none. )",
