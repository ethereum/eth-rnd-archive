We just included the decisions made, and a summary of the important stuff said.\n\u003e Also, Micah had some great information about what is required to push an EIP forward.  This is in the notes, but where could we copy this to make it more permanent?\n\u003e If I don’t hear of any issues, I’ll do the pull request.\n\u003c@!396163506757435403\u003e I think it will be valuable to add (item 2) questions  brought up from the EIP survey. The discussion turned out to be good FAQ for people who missed the meeting. Also,  we made a decision of merging PR to EIP-1 wrt  (item1) proliferation of EIP statuses. It'd make sense to capture that discussion in notes.",
