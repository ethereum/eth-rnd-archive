But we can't prevent them.\n\nIf we want to just allow them in the future, how about insisting that they be _draft_ PRs on the EIP repo,  and be closed  _by the author_ after a few days of fun, with a status of \"April Fools\".  Or if that is too much work, maybe a bot can close all April 1 PRs, to be reopened by the author in a few rare cases.  Or something like that.",
