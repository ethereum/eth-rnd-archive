Additionally, \u003c@689161464829050960\u003e pointed out in another channel that the idea of a spec scope may be just be additional red tape you're not interested in taking on.\n\nI'd like to get all of your feedback on this to see if it might align with your vision of what a split might look like in the future as we get more coordination in the Wallet space and eventually getting something like this going for ERC devs too.",
