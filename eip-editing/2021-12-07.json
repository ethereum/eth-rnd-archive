The general consensus from those in the meeting was that the set of EIP Editors should include people who are \"active editors\", not \"anyone who has every been an active editor\".  There was then a brief discussion on what some vague requirements are for being considered an \"active editor\" like showing up to EIPIP meetings from time to time, reviewing EIPs on a semi-regular basis, engaging with editorial process tasks, etc.",

I _have not consented_ to any change to my active status.\n\nWhat I want is for the tools to inform myself and authors that I am available to review EIPs, and to able to merge them into the repo when I do.  That is all, thank you.",
