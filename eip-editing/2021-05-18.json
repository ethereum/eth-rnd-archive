I'm taking a break after seeming to be the only active editor for a while.  It also may not be clear whether editors should merge their own drafts.  It's fine by me, not sure how Axic feels.\n\nOn editing versus reviewing - I've appreciated your uncompromising reviews, Micah, and have been uncompromising in some of mine.  But as I recall it you've also stood back and said that you would not block merging so long as formal requirements are met, but asked that someone else do it.  I think that might be the appropriate approach.",
