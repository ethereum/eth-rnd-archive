If it is in fact the case that you think this doesn't matter and you just want the problem to go away so we can move on, then I recommend approving \u003chttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5255\u003e and we can continue to address the ethos disagreement slowly over time in the calls and continued discussion here.  If, on the other hand, you think this is an important issue and it does matter, then we should continue discussing here and in the PR without the pretense that one or more parties involved in the discussion don't really care and think this isn't a big deal.",
