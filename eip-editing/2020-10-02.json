I would love to see sponsored transactions go in next (possibly at the same time as access lists) and I think that one has the least opposition.  Batch has the most opposition and expiring has some opposition (transactions that can \"become invalid later\" cause complications in pending pools).",

I previously thought that you could always go back to draft from stagnant/withdrawn/abandoned, while it seems others believe that there should be a status for \"dead and never coming back, this number is officially burned and will never become used\".\n\u003e I'm personally on the fence as to whether there is value in an unresurrectable status, but if I accept that there is then I think having a different status for unresurrectable and resurrectable is valuable.  I'm not sure if you were aware of that distinction previously or not, but wanted to share since you weren't at the meeting today.\n\n\u003c@!301186049323958275\u003e I am also on the same understanding/opinion that one can always go back to draft.",
