There's certainly a lot of room for improvement though.\n\nWe've mostly been focused on passing the test suite though, so the English narrative-style documentation is extremely lacking. As we progress, we're going to need to spend a lot more time on the non-code documentation, which might be a great opportunity to practice reading Python code 😉\n\n[0]: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/",

        "content": "Unless things are described in English they are unreadable to most people.  But I'm not sure some semantics can be specified well in Python anyway -- it's not that declarative.  That is, an algorithm to enforce a set of constraints may not a clear way to state what the constraints are.  It's done -- e.g. using a compiler as the spec for a language -- but it's far from ideal.",

If it included the code for specifying the stack usage of all of the opcodes it would be substantially longer.  And I defy you to extract those six sentences out of the code, or to express much of them in Python in the first place.",
