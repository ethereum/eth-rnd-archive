Why you think Informational and Meta EIPs are bad?\n\nI think Informational EIP useful. For example, the EIP I created, 3023, is important to be documented in the EIP site, because it proposes guidelines for other EIP and systems that are implementing other EIPs. i.e. information directed to anyone building wallets interfaces or wallet contracts, to follow certain good practices to solve the issue in ERC20 approve and call design, which is a common mistake currently causing millions in value loss. When someone searching about ERC20 it should appears as a document that references to ERC20.",
