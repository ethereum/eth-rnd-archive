Natural language is a very powerful tool and is great at conveying high level meaning.\n\n\u003e But I'm not sure some semantics can be specified well in Python anyway -- it's not that declarative.  That is, an algorithm to enforce a set of constraints may not a clear way to state what the constraints are.\n\nI don't think anyone wants to replace the yellow paper with pure unannotated Python. That would be a huge regression from where we stand today. In your scenario, ideally we'd want to have an English description of the constraints, then a dead simple Python implementation of the algorithm. I wouldn't base your opinion of the project on the current state of the repository; like I said earlier, we're very focused on the implementation and will need to go in and add the natural language before we're \"finished\".",
