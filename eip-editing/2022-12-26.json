Recently noticed that old EIP-155 transactions (ex: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa8f503d99f9eef98e6619ba290b7bf0b55ec0bdce259cfc55734e4d1efc2d198) do not encode 9 fields, but only 6. It contradicts the same EIP that states that if v in {35,37}, it SHOULD encode 9 fields. Has this requirement been modified?",
