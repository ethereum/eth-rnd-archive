I think our differences are sourced in a couple of places.\n\nI'm dubious that someone who doesn't understand what `Withdrawn by author` and `Withdrawn due to inactivity` means will understand what `Stagnant` and `Withdrawn` means.  I believe that the former two are significantly more verbose/descriptive and *more likely* to result in the outcome you desire than your proposed solution.  Perhaps the issue is that you are imagining those two fields showing up separately on the EIPs page, rather than combined?  This is what I had in mind for the status field with reason field embedded:",

I would rather deal with those people more directly by redirecting them elsewhere, deleting comments, banning from organization, etc. rather than spoiling our process because they refuse to take a moment to understand it (after having it explained).  I get the impression from the above that you are hoping that this change will make it so we (editors) have to moderate less, but I personally believe that there will *always* be some amount of moderation that is necessary no matter how hard we try to make the process intuitive to the casual viewer and at some point we need to stop optimizing for the lowest common denominator and instead favor optimizing for people who appropriately use the system.  To me, your proposal for separate statuses crosses that line, though I can appreciate that we disagree on where that line is.",
