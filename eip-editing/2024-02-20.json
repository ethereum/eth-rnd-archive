The EIP-1 as seen on the page doesn't mention it (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1), but the source for it does https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md#ethereum-yellow-paper\n\nThe linter eipw doesn't list it as an exception https://github.com/ethereum/eipw/blob/master/eipw-lint/src/lib.rs#L428, so I guess it is not allowed, but why would the EIP-1 source .md file include it? I stumbled upon that piece first and was convinced they were allowed.",
