        "content": "In the last EIP IP meeting https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/blob/master/All%20EIPIP%20Meetings/Meeting%20031.md\nCreating a separate ERC repository was discussed, which would effectively remove ERCs from the EIP repository.\nSimilarly, removing EIP 1 from the EIP repository has also been proposed.\n\nWe’ve been adding these proposals to the WIP “EIP Signal Source Cleanup” document:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUpMQh9gA5z3WSDvXKqU_CS6g3Y0hugJZHDYQdKxot8/edit\n\nSam Richards has been making some comments in that document and asking great questions.\n\nSpecifically, he is asking if we are going to remove EIP 1, do we intend on removing all meta EIPs, providing this link:\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/meta\n\nAs I indicated, it has been proposed in the last EIP IP meeting that we would create a new ERC repository, as a new separate home for ERC EIPs.\n\nIt seems to me, if we remove meta EIPs, we would similarly need to create an additional home for Meta EIPs to manage things like EIP 1.  Again, more work to find a maintainer of yet another git repository.\n\nSam mentioned that he read somewhere that a goal was to take network upgrades out of the EIP process.  Is this true?  If so, is this a separate proposal from the separation proposals above?\n\nI’m trying to get educated on and collect all the issues around all this.  But it seems to me if we want to have a single source of truth for EIPs, what we have now seems ideal to me  Everything can be maintained in the same single source of truth repository  (far less work).\nAlso, for the people that want things to be separated, the tabs on eips.ethereum.org make this possible.  If one only wants core EIPs, without ERCs, they can just select on the core tab, right?\n\nAnyway, for those proposing removing ERCs, EIP 1 and such from the EIP repository, does keeping things the way they are make sense?  If not, can you guys help me understand where we want to end up with all this?",
