(Not static and not offering enough safety, which I've fixed.  Mistaken claims about performance, which I've corrected.)  And a lot of the text remains the same.  So I see it as ongoing work on the same ideas, and suspect withdrawing it in favor of a new number now would only cause confusion.  But I see your point.\n\nMy inclination is to wait and see what comes of our discussions.  I can see pulling portions of EIP-2315 and EIP-3779 together, or splitting them apart.  @Arachnid's EIP-3336 andEIP- 3337 are out there, you have ideas about mapping procedures to EOF code sections, and so on.  So zero or more new EIPs might be the result, and the old ones withdrawn anyway.",

This time was different because I made a lot of changes, and so the bot wasn't working correctly for a while. \n\nI think it also stems from me thinking opening / closing is not a big deal. But I can understand why this would be annoying.\n\nAction items:\n- develop on a private fork",
