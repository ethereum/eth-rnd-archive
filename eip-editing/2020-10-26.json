It is an interactive command line tool that prompts questions to the user and create the markdown file for the EIP according to the official template. The user can select among a list of choices for some fields like the status (less error prone than an open field IMO). Some fields are stored in a global configuration file such as the author name and github handle so that they are the default answer and the user can skip writing them. I will try to extend it to add more features like maybe automating some git operations to help authors with limited knowledge of git. Any feedback welcome.\nhttps://github.com/abdelhamidbakhta/generator-eip",
