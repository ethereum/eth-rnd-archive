I think I misunderstood something.\nDoes `LegacyTransaction` (i.e. regular transactions BEFORE Berlin) have an optional `TransactionType` ?\nI think I misunderstood the descrition in the EIP that was\n\n\u003e `Transaction` is either `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` or `LegacyTransaction`\n\nI thought the `or` meant: `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` OR `TransactionType || LegacyTransaction`... but now I *think* I got confused.\n\nThe thing that makes me doubt is that the `access_list` of EIP2930 is \"optional\"... so if I get a `0x01 || LegacyTransaction`, that has NO `access_list`, am I supposed to reject it? Or accept it? 🙂",
