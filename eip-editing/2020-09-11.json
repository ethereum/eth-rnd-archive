You have timeframe in there, but I think it is important to include editor criteria as well.  For example, for something to move into Draft it has to have its front matter filled out and be properly formatted.  For something to move into Candidate it has to be in the form of a specification without any open questions, incomplete sections, and written targeting the proper audience (readers 5 years in the future wanting to implement the specification).",

If they make a mistake, no big deal as we can just fix it (e.g., undo), and if they make the same mistake over and over again then they probably shouldn't be an editor.  Also, I sincerely hope that in 3-4 years we have a stagnant bot that is doing all this so editors basically never move something to withdrawn.",

I generally dislike the idea of adding more statuses in fear that people are going to interpret them wrong without evidence yet that they will.  Worst case scenario, we can do a find and replace and switch from `status: Withdrawn; reason: Author Non-resonsive` to `status: Stagnant` without too much difficulty (especially if we are strict on formatting in the frontmatter across the repository, which I generally advocate for anyway).",
