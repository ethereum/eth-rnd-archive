        "content": "Here's a bit of a conundrum - I was just reviewing the Sign in With Ethereum spec (EIP-4361)  and realized that they reference ISO 8601 date format and was thinking that would be a good spec that should be referenced out to, but it's a paid spec so not really possible. Does anyone know of another free place I could link out to in order to normatively reference that spec which would also be a stable link?",

Would it be better to just reference this by name like they've already done https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#message-field-descriptions and not link? It seems there's sufficient amount of docs available for most devs to figure out what an ISO 8601 date is, but not ideal for spec writing to leave this up to the reader to assume.",
