Yes, it has implications, but at its core, it's basically nothing.\n\nI think the two things we need to do to improve the process here are:\n\n1. From now on, discuss any potentially contentious actions in public, either here or in the ECH discord. Get participation from those you know feel strongly, and don't consider silence consent. Maybe put this in EIP-5069?\n2. Add a rule explicitly prohibiting vanity EIP numbers to EIP-1, if it isn't already mentioned.",

Worse, they did so in a way that appears to attempt to avoid/prevent engagement with the other editors (private conversations rather than public) implying intentional subversion.\n\nAs Killari alluded to, if we have editors that are actively trying to subvert the system I don't think there exists any set of rules we could implement that would address the root problem.  What we need are editors who don't try to subvert/game the system.  This is certainly a hard problem, and one that every system of governance suffers from with with no known foolproof solution.",
