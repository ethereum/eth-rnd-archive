I'd like to resurface creating a new opcode for the transaction nonce again.\n\nUse cases:\n\n(Primary motivation) Address attestations up to a given transaction count: These attestations can be used for purposes like detecting illicit activity or one-time identity verification.\n\n(Mentioned earlier) Future CREATE addresses.\n\n(Just a thought) Off-chain transaction ordering: Transactions would only be valid if submitted in the agreed-upon order.\n\n\nThoughts/questions are appreciated!",
