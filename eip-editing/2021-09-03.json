Got a good grip on it, one suggestion I have would be to relocate all the jekyll related files (basically .html, _config.yml, gemfile, etc...) into their own dedicated folder for readability and just separation of concerns. That would also make it super easy for a bot to tag the relevant people if they need to review changes to the ruby related code.",
