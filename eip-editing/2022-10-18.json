With the increasing number of chains, in particular in the post-sharding future of EVMs, some people want to use some hash function for collision resilient hashing functions e.g. `keccak256(\u003chuman-readable-string\")` as a way to generate new chainIds which will be the full space of  `uint256`,\n2.  `ChainId` was being used be added to the parity bit for signatures e.g. EIP-712 which has a ceiling of `floor(MAX_UINT64 / 2) - 36` unless we manipulate the algorithm.\n\nIt think it's important to decision is being made before Shanghai Hardfork",
