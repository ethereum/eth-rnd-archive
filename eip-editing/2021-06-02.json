We have a few existing EIPs for some of these changes on a per-endpoint basis, such as:\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3041\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3044\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3045\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3046\n\nand there are a handful of other endpoints that need changes but do not have EIPs.  However, as most of the changes are to `result`  I think they can be consolidated to a few individual schema changes to #components in the eth1 spec repo.  \n\nCould/should we make EIPs against the json-rpc spec components or should we be submitting individual EIPs against each json-rpc endpoint that would have its result payload changed?",
