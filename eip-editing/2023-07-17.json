We've removed the Review and Last Call stages for Working Group EIPs -- working groups are responsible for their own process.  That means that the Editors maintain overall standards, but that the devs are free to keep Draft EIPs anywhere the want, move them through their process any way that they want, and impose any additional standards of quality, style, formatting etc. that they want.  We've added working-group fields to the Preamble they can use for that purpose, and they can add more if they want.",
