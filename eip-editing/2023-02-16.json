As an ERC author I had an ERC number changed due to number lunging (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/4888#issuecomment-1064757848), so have a strong appreciation for perceived value of numbers and transparency of the number assigning process.\n\nI visit the EIP repo most week days, but work in the Australian time zone so wouldn't want to attend EIPIP meetings at their current time.",
