The best I can come up with is something like, \"Micah is evil and will block us from doing this good thing, so lets do this good thing out of sight so Micah doesn't block it.\"\n\nAnother world model that makes it not malicious is to chalk it up to laziness/simplicity, \"I could post on the GitHub issue, but it would be quicker/easier to just handle the issue in DMs to resolve it quickly\".  I find the laziness/simplicity model fairly uncompelling as it requires the parties involved all being unaware of our normal procedure to discuss these things publicly and I don't have a world model where that is the case other than everyone involved has amnesia or something.\n\nI am open to other world models or improved models that fit the evidence though!",
