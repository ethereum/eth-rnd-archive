And if it were, is it even enforceable? 2) I asked them to update offline - I should have communicated over the issue, but I had also asked Sam in the past about the number and he said didn't feel strongly enough to fight about it and I already had a channel open with the authors discussing the numbering and a few other issues so I just mentioned a few things to fix over that channel. 3) Alex is an editor, but even more so, he is a valuable contributor to ethereum. I'd rather not nickel and dime long term, trusted contributors to the protocol over eip numbering. 4) it's possible they created some spam issues before 5000, but the others have assured me this isn't the case and I don't have any other option to take their word for it",
