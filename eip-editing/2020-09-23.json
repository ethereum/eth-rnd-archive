Down the road, we'd like to expand to allow multiple standard bytecode prefixes (if the `IS_STATIC` EIP gets accepted, for example.)\n\nSince the list of allowed prefixes only affects pending transactions, adding a new prefix wouldn't be a consensus critical change, but I think it would still warrant a new EIP?",

I previously thought that you could always go back to draft from stagnant/withdrawn/abandoned, while it seems others believe that there should be a status for \"dead and never coming back, this number is officially burned and will never become used\".\nI'm personally on the fence as to whether there is value in an unresurrectable status, but if I accept that there is then I think having a different status for unresurrectable and resurrectable is valuable.  I'm not sure if you were aware of that distinction previously or not, but wanted to share since you weren't at the meeting today.",
