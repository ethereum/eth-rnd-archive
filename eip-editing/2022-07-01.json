Doctors...\n\n I think the EIP template has become too rigid over time, drifting too far from IETF approach that \u003c@191378736254287874\u003e, \u003c@492808720615604251\u003e and I partly took as a model, and as I recall we intended our stricter BIP-style template to be subject to some editorial discretion and deference to the author.  And I don't recall links being forbidden, and certainly included too many of them in my proposals. What we do need is EIP-1 guidance on the sparing use of the highest-quality available links, with proper citations to the published literature where available.  Without them Motivation and Rationale sections can be littered with bald assertions.",

I'd suggest they could be used judiciously along with high-quality references to pull together a reasonably complete set of design documents.",

It's a client, and it will need its own repo and a dedicated team, just like any other client.  I take it that when clients go Final they tag the code that goes on the mainnet, and at that time the relevant EIPs can be updated to reference it.  From there the EIP remains subject to errata if it does not describe the behavior of the mainnet.",

An Informational EIP might be best for laying out the resulting consensus  at a conceptual level.  This might amount to the design document you have in mind.  A Meta EIP might be appropriate for specifying the mutual dependencies among the agreed on set of EIPs that specify the new opcodes and associated validation rules.
