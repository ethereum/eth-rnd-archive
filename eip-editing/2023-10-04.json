Though this still has issues of number gaming. Alternatively if editors have discretion then there could be a perception of preferential treatment to insiders.",

I have issued a new number: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7815\n\nThere were two EIP/ERCs awaiting numbers, I believe we should issue in order of when PRs are created, but we don't have a rule on this.",
