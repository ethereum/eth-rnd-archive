A standard is valuable when there is a many-to-many relationship between parties.  An example of something that needs a standard is web pages because there are many browsers that come and go over time and there are many web pages on the internet that come and go over time.  In order for all web pages to work on all browsers, we need a standard.  If you have a one to many relationship or a one to one relationship, then you don't need a standard and instead just have a Good Idea that you can implement.",
