For reference the source was that during my implementation of better error handling the bot would not mark things as failed which were not recognized as error types I defined. So that left a lot of wiggle room for there to be an error but not failure.\n\nTo fix this I added error handling and fixed the triggering bug. In addition I wrote tests to make sure this exact behavior doesn't happen again.",
