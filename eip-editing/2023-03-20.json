Here's where I made the PR: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6691\n\nMain concern was that there were other EIPs referencing ISO specs (without linking them) which seems like a bad practice to encourage as well since it suggests readers still need to go pay for the spec even if it's not linked.",
