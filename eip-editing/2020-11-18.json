        "content": "Just some additional thoughts of mine in the “should silence imply agreement or objection?” discussion we had in the EIP IP meeting this morning.\n\nFalsifiability is a critical part of building consensus.  If there is a camp that is not yet on board with the consensus, if it is a good camp, the supporters of such should be able to describe what could falsify their camp for the supporters of that camp.  Once all camps describe this in their camp statement, then it is up to the experimentalists to force a consensus.  If the competing camp simply isn’t getting what they want in the consensus camp, what changes would be required to include them?\n\nThe bottom line is that having the ability to abandon falsified camps (remove your support from an objecting camp when you agree your camp has been falsified or your desires met) is critically important to any hope of building and tracking consensus.\n\nIf you have a way to remove your support from a static petition, you can then assume silence implies agreement.  When you propose a change to a camp, if no supporters of the camp object during the 24 hour review period, you can assume unanimous agreement with the change, and it can then go live.  This is the most efficient way to have a dynamic petition that can improve and move towards consensus, going forward.\n\nConsensus shouldn’t be forced.  Bottom up win/win organizations don’t need politics or governance, they just need good communication about what everyone wants.  That, by definition, is consensus.",
