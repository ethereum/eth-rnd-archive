        "content": "At the end of the EIPIP call, Micah and I had a good conversation about what exactly is valuable about keeping EIPs as part of the executable spec process. The first bit is obviously the recognition of the name. The second one is having a single ID to refer to changes (and this is the easiest thing to align across specs outside of EIPs). The third, is to have a single place to specify higher-level aspects of a change that can potentially though many parts of Ethereum. \n\nMicah has moved me towards thinking that \"EIP\" may not be the right way to think about it, but perhaps it's more something of a \"design document\" for changes. The EIP template is rigid, links can't be included, etc. whereas a great design document probably has multiple links (incl. to the specs themselves), perhaps some diagrams, etc. \n\nIMO this might be an interesting idea to explore. One thing I think is a must-have is a central place for these to live that's easy for people to find. Right now, our status quo is \"a bunch of random hackmd docs\" and that's far from ideal.",
