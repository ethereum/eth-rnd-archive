You may follow Do's and Don'ts for Editors here - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5069 \n\nThe present EIP process is authors' driven. \nIf an EIP author is incorporating comments suggested by editors/community and generally sticks around to promote EIPs, the proposal will become a standard for Ethereum ecosystem.  \n\nSo there may not be a list of top 10-15. However, IMO actual deployments data for proposals in `Last Call` maybe value adding for authors as well as EIP editors.",
