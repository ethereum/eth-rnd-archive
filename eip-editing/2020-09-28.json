That was caused by either outdated or misconfigured tooling. An invalid deposit is a deposit that _went through_ the checks in the contract but still contains an invalid BLS signature.\n\nI created a tracking ticket https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2081\n\nOn the testnets we basically just used it to investigate why there would be invalid signatures, identified the issue and fixed the tooling. This is probably fine if we can ensure that all our tooling is battle-tested for a mainnet launch.\n\nBut then again, we saw invalid deposits for _every_ testnet launch. Now that we are nearing a mainnet launch, we should tripple-check that this will not happen. \n\nBack in spring I was hoping we will get the precompile before mainnet launch, eventually allowing us to do signature checks in the contract itself, rejecting formally correct deposits with invalid signatures. That would futher prevent accidentally \"burning\" mainnet ether.",
