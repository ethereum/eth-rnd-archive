Any future activation mechanisms can live in their own EIPs, and require this one.\n\nLicense discussion: agreed we can prevent `UNLICENSED` code with the license checker. Lots of other discussion about licenses but no decision. Discussion here: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/14329\n\nEIP-4804: Substantial update, looking for input from author.\n\nMore details here: https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/issues/232",
