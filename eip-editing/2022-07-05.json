I'd be happier in a world where we use EIP-X as the design document, and then link to whatever numbering version in the specs (e.g. an incrementing branch number in the EL/CL specs which are separate) rather than creating a new process for these design documents. Ideally, I'd even prefer to have the numbering version in the spec match the EIP number, but feel less strongly about that bit 🙂",
