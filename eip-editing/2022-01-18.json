Not sure where to ask this question, but hoping someone can point me in the right direction 🙂  As an on-chain NFT dev, I tend to pack as much logic as possible in the ERC721 tokenURI method.  I’ve noticed in hardhat at least, there’s a default gas limit of 30M on view functions (I think it used to be 12.5M but looks like it was updated recently, maybe after EIP-1559? https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#blockgaslimit).  I’ve also seen it mentioned that this limit might be 50M in geth (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/b1f09596e63e85748c4344f0bad08d668f96c468/accounts/abi/bind/backends/simulated.go#L619-L621).  Is there an EIP or anything that specifies the gas limit of view functions, or are these different for every client? Looking to learn as much as possible about this constraint, as it comes into play quite a bit with on-chain NFTs.  Thanks!",
