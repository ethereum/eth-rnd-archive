The problem here is that the usual operating policy of \"editors assign numbers\" and \"when editors disagree, they discuss publicly\" wasn't followed and we don't know why so we can only guess as to the reasoning/motivations about what happened behind the closed doors.  This is why we prefer to do everything in public, to minimize the uncertainty around why decisions are being made.",
