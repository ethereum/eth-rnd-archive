It seems that historically we haven't used the EIP process effectively/correctly, and we now have several EIPs that are wasting away in a non-final state long after they have been implemented across many clients.  Unlike many other parts of Ethereum, the gossip protocol actually has regularly updated/maintained documents that I think you are the champion of.\n\nDo you think we should just stop trying to use the EIP process for gossip changes and instead use the docs for change control?",
