(congrats on your talk by the way \u003c@!552133098075193354\u003e, looks like you had a lot of interest judging by how busy the breakout room was!)\n\nFollowing this, I decided to build an MVP/POC web app: https://eip.design (https://github.com/unegma/eip.design) meant as a high level 'feedback' tool, the 'ideas' from which can then be refined and submitted as actual 'correct format' EIPs (if they are deemed worthy).\n\nIf this seems like an interesting idea, I will continue developing it, \u003c@!191378736254287874\u003e this may be one that Baseline protocol would be interested in. Any other ideas or suggestions or feedback much welcome.",

I think enterprises getting involved in the EIP process and submitting is great, but in my experience there is a knowledge gap with enterprise CTOs and tech leads in businesses about what an EIP is and what belongs in an EIP, which it sounds like you are trying to fix. We haven't done a great job making EIP making easy to understand or making the EIP process understandable. The best way you can help is to have a section on your site that explains, in a tech business person's language, what does and doesn't belong in an EIP.",
