Plus I don't think reference implementations are a good approach -- it's difficult to prevent implementation details from leaking into the spec, and difficult to engage with domain experts who aren't programmers.  It's worth looking at how Wasm did it -- the spec is given in both English and a formal notation, with a commitment that both of them are complete and mean the same thing.",
