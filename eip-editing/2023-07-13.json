As the last \"founder\" left I can say that we valued pulling the community together, and I fear this proposal is the start of a process of pulling it apart.  I am not fundamentally opposed to keeping ERCs and EIPs in separate \"filing cabinets\", but before we do that I want to know -- in some detail -- what changes that split enables and how they support maintaining a unified community of Ethereum developers.  If our philosophy has shifted so much that such a community is not a core value then I don't want to participate.",

Acceding to the requests of the community is more inline with decentralization.  The desire to compel people into one single community is another feature of centralization.\n\nThe process isn’t pulling apart, it has been pulling apart for years and the split is a late stage attempt to keep the EIP process before it completely unravels.  Ask your self: where are the Consensus Layer specifications?  Where are the CL change proposals?  Where is the Dencun meta-EIP?  They have all already left because the process doesn’t serve them.",
