        "content": "greetings fellow humans! I am a functional programmer and language designer developing specification languages to represent laws and (non-smart) contracts, now considering transpilation to Solidity through refinement \u0026 extraction methods. One approach we are considering is to reduce the amount of rope that developers seem to be currently using to hang themselves, by creating a higher-level DSL that restricts expressivity to what is both idiomatic and verifiable. I know there has been some work done in formal verification for crypto; I am now looking into the history of languages that target Solidity, similar to how many web dev languages target JS coming from a much terser syntax, or from a different paradigm,  e.g. Elm, Coffeescript.",
