        "content": "Just wanted to add a quick comment here: there have been (brief) discussions about how to set up a nice formal methods / formal verification discussion channel. Right now the verified-zkevm telegram channel (~200 members) has some discussion related to that topic (alongside many parallel, less public, groups) and I don't think there are any other similar reasonably big discussion groups for smart contract verification and other topics that aren't in the scope of verified-zkevm. \nWe've thought about setting up a zulip but without much urgency since moving people across platforms/channels is always difficult. I would say that this channel (or any single channel format) might not be great because the application of formal methods (let alone formal verification) to different parts of the Ethereum stack condensed into a single channel could make it too messy to follow if it was active (this was already an issue within the subset of things covered by verified-zkevm).",
