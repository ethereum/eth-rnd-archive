When an assertion violation happens I get a large output which starts with\n```\n{\n  auxiliaryInputRequested: {\n    smtlib2queries: {\n      '0x5e7df8f9c2da419124ac9c1918697f4d25bea8f5918512e44855c3ee108eb46f': '(set-logic HORN)\\n' +\n        '\\n' +\n        '(declare-datatypes ((|state_type| 0)) (((|state_type| (|balances| (Array Int Int))))))\\n' +\n```\n.\n\nI did not get any counter examples. Instead, I get a message at the end saying that there were no Horn solvers available.\n```\n    {\n      component: 'general',\n      errorCode: '3996',\n      formattedMessage: 'Warning: CHC analysis was not possible.
