        "content": "With respect to https://verified-zkevm.org/ the main focus is on making sure that if you run the EVM (in practice revm as zkVMs support Rust for now) as guest program on a zkVM (interpreting EVM bytecode) you get the same behaviour as you'd expect from a formal specification of the EVM. Runtime Verification is working on this right now as part of a grant, using their KEVM and KRISC-V specifications, aiming to establish a bisimulation for every opcode. By doing the proofs after compilation we're also aiming to avoid the possibility of compiler bugs but this has been a bit trickier than expected in places. This also will not cover precompiles for now (but we'll get to this later). (Another annoyance is that different zkVMs use different compile targets so the proofs won't necessarily carry over to all zkVMs.) Runtime Verification are also showing equivalence between KEVM and Nethermind's EVM specification in Lean via a new Lean backend for K (which will also have other uses e.g. to use the strengths of each spec/language/tooling for other tasks).\nThere is a recording of an update on this work from March here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op9LYW9083w. It's covers the state of EVM specifications more generally, but I will be writing up some blog posts about the progress on the whole project soon (I should already have done so) that will take less time to parse.",
