Regarding using Eldarica: If I understand correctly, one would basically need to run the compiler with `settings.modelChecker.solvers=smtlib2` and provide a `smtSolver` callback that executes Eldarica (this callback will probably look very similar to the default one provided here https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/blob/master/smtsolver.js). Would this be the way to do it?",
