        "content": "Would a \"precompile\" serve that better?  Create a canonical EVM bytecode then clients can identify the codehash and optimize the dispatch?  \n\nBut this illustrates the complexities of forwarders: who has the authority to update the target address?  The EOA of the address (in context of EIP-7377)?  An EOA set at deploy time? Any contract? Can that updater be updated?  and if so by who?  Which starts the whole loop over again (who can update the updater updater) and we have to settle on a base case.\n\nOne and done enshrinement (like 7377 does for EOAs) is easier to assess for security, but standards and practices for who can update smart contracts will continually evolve, so I feel leaving it in the EVM layer is ultimately safer than enshrining one practice in the protocol layer.",
