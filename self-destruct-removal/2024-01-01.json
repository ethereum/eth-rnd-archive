        "content": "Yes this is a good design and could be used to make common deployments much cheaper.\n\nSolidity introduces the concept of `immutable` fields that are parameterizations of code for deployment configuration. I suspect each tweak would still require a separate code-address deployment though most of the rest is the same. They use `immutable` fields instead of `SLOAD` because the runtime gas is lower. Perhaps these `immutable` fields could be supported with immutable configuration parameters also in the account header, or perhaps `SLOAD` could be made to require less gas by asserting the expected storage value in transaction access lists.",
