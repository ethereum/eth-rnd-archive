Since we can't use the `HistoricalSummaries` endpoint yet, I implemented support for downloading the BeaconState from the BeaconAPI using SSZ so the bridge can generate HistoricalSummaries in like 25-30 seconds instead of a minute+ downloading the state using JSON, which isn't bad since realistically we only need to gossip these every 27 hours.\n\nIt seems like the main reason the historical summaries bridge was disabled was because fetching the BeaconState over JSON which had a high load and it was assumed the `HistoricalSummary` endpoints would be deployed quicker? It has been 6 months since then though. Using SSZ heavily reduces the load so I think we should be good.",
