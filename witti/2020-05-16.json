        "content": "There are different stages, in the following order:\n1. You deposit. Minimum 1 ETH, but need 32 ETH deposited before you can really start to participate.\n2. An \"Eth1Data\" that references your deposit is mature enough to get voted for by proposers. This takes 1024 eth1 blocks. As a safety precaution to avoid eth1 forks.\n3. Half of the proposers in a voting period vote for the same data, a root that allows the beacon chain to trust your deposit. This takes 512 to 1024 beacon chain slots. Or worse, if eth1 voters disagree during a full voting period (1024 slots).\n4. A churn in deposit processing is applied, to not have crazy large blocks when there are lots of deposits. Only 16 deposits at a time are processed per block. Normally not an issue, but if you make mass-deposits, or if there are lots of people, then it may slow things down a little.\n5. Your first deposit creates a validator slot (if it's valid). Once you accumulate 32 ETH worth of deposits, you become \"eligible\". This accumulation may happen in multiple deposits, but generally you deposit 32 ETH in one go.\n6. Eligibility generally means that you get to be activated once the starting epoch of your eligibility is finalized. If many validators are eligible, they will be activated in a FIFO queue (first come, first serve). A churn-rate is applied to not activate too many at a time (consensus security measure). This generally means that queued validators are activated in groups of 4 (the minimum churn limit). Once there are `(2**16)*5=327680` or more active validators, more may be activated at a time (testnets are too small for this)\n7. Once dequeued, you are activated, and can participate after 1+4 = 5 more epochs of waiting.",
