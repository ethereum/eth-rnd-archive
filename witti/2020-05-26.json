This means that we agree on `current_fork_version` and `genesis_validators_root`, but not on `next_fork_version`. The simplest answer I can think for this is that some client (whoever uses 13000) is setting their `next_fork_version` to \"default\" (all zeros) instead of equal to `current_fork_version`, like the spec says.",
