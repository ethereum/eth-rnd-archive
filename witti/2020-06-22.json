        "content": "It's just a matter of priorities.  For example Teku has implemented v0.12.1 to the point of passing reference tests but we're mostly focussed on implementing the things we've learnt from Witti rather than on the next testnet.  I think Lighthouse has also implemented v0.12.1 but are doing more of their own testing on it before they want to spin up a public testnet.\n\nBasically, implementing the spec is a relatively easy part of building a client and public testnets take up quite a lot of time and attention to spin up and support.  So we don't necessarily need to rush to creating a new testnet to continue making good progress and different teams have prioritised it in different ways.",
