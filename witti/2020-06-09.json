They don't have the \"Sync_Status\":\"Behind\" or \"Synced\" property...instead it is \"Advanced\".

That state is reserved for when we connect to a peer and they claim to be further ahead in the chain than we are. We therefore would try to sync from them. If they are lying, at some point we will identify it and boot them",
