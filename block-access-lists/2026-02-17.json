So without knowing if we want to keep read or not inside the BALs ?",

    "content": "We can do the execution-related benchmarking directly on devnet-2. For state-related benchmarks we may want to use devnet-2-ready clients but do so on a shadowfork of mainnet and on bloatnet as we don't have enough state on a devnet to get reasonable numbers there.\n\nRe the cap (PR 11323): we may need it even if we get rid of the state locations that aren't changed in the BAL as clients could still intitiate a batch IO process for the remaining items (those that are changed).\nFor the benchmarks the PR isn't needed though - it's only a defense measure against DoS from invalid blocks and we need it for testnets at the latest. My feeling is we should do it for devnet 3 and if we then find out that we want to remove the \"reads\", the formula would just change from using `bal_items = storage_keys + addresses` to `bal_items = addresses`",
