How many BALs (for how many blocks) will clients keep (e.g. treated similarly as receipts - using txlookuplimit or enforce a minimum)?\n2. What are clients' thoughts on the optimizations:\nThere are 3 optimizations (besides sync): parallel loading from disk, parallel execution and parallel post-state root computation. As we've heard in the last breakout call, geth ( \u003c@427903869226582018\u003e ) and nethermind ( \u003c@348512261955911691\u003e ) have started to implement parallel state root computation. Iirc Erigon mentioned to start looking into / implementing parallel execution. I'm interested in, which ones are priorities to you and how complex is each optimization?",
