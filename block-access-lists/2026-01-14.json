It looks like we are passing all the BAL test cases (including any new ones) when I run the engine tests locally. We fail most of the blockchain tests because the BAL is no longer provided in the tests but for Amsterdam we expect that a BAL will always be provided for non-finalized blocks. Perhaps these tests could provide the BAL in another field in the json data (outside the block body)?",
