This isn’t always accurate, for example, an account might spend 0.001 eth and get back 0.0005 ETH in the same transaction, which could make it appear that only 0.0005 gas was used instead of 0.001 but such cases should be relatively rare.",

For example: deploying a contract has a code deposit cost that is mostly indended to pay for long-term code storage (it's not enough). So it can be hit and miss for work distribution",
