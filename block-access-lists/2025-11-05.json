Because if you have a lot of SSTORE you will have more intermediate nodes to read in the state root computation step+the read of the gast cost . So if we do state root background computation at the same time as we do batch reading it will increase the amount of IO. One SLOAD is only one read with a flat db but one write can be more as you need to climb the trie. So what is the wort case a block full of SLOAD or full of SSTORE ?",

If we detect only one or two transactions using too much gas, we could start batch reading, because there’s a higher chance we are in this kind of scenario.
