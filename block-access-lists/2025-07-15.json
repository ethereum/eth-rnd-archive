Based on some initial analyses which we don't yet have there will be a decision about removing the state locations or not.\nThe EIP is still using SSZ format and some people prefer SSZ because of the possibility to create compact proofs. On the other hand RLP would be the easier choice as everything uses RLP on the EL already.\n\nThis is a repo used for building BALs and experimenting with different encodings, variants and optimizations:\nhttps://github.com/nerolation/eth-bal-analysis/tree/main\n\nThere're also EELS specs with many tests:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/compare/forks/osaka...nerolation:execution-specs:bals\n\n \u003c@968526635735326741\u003e  did a thorough analysis on the worst-case BAL size:\nhttps://notes.ethereum.org/@misilva/r1CyZf_Vlx\n\nGeth, Besu and Erigon are actively working on it and will have a prototype soon\nReth and  Nethermind are waiting for headliner selection",
