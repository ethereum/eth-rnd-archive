The root cause appears to be that a call is made to `0x000...000` which doesn't have enough gas to cover the portion of the cost that doesn't depend on looking up the target account (memory gas cost + transfer cost + EIP 2929 cold access cost).\n\nReth/Geth go out of gas before reading the target account, but Besu does not.\n\nI've posted the chain in the following google drive link.  The directory contains `genesis.json`, the block range where the clients stayed in sync (`blocks1-915.rlp`) and the block that broke consensus (`block916.rlp`).\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LVHHkXvEVKbSvSkPfXT252fJ8Zt04TZi?usp=sharing",
