        "content": "Yes RLP is smaller.\nAt today's gas limit the avg BAL size (without read locations; snappy compressed) is around 40 KiB using RLP, and 43 KiB using SSZ. So the 10% overhead for non-compressed sized(?) sounds reasonable.\nReads add significant size too: on avg. another 50%. Thus, we should discuss on ACD if we need the state locations (in addition to the state diffs) or not and thereby save some bandwidth.\nRight now it feels like most are for removing reads so I might update the EIP regarding that, but would love to hear from client devs if having all state location that will be involved (no matter if just read from, e.g. BALANCE opcode) or do we just care about the state diff. The argument for the state locations is that it might enable to do parallel IO before starting execution.",
