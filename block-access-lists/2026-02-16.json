    "content": "Today I did a complementary AI-supported (Opus 4.6) spec analysis after EthereumJS implementation, complementing the first one from above. While the first one was how to ease implementation, this one is **about the spec design itself**, with a focus on **simplification** by detecting common patterns or unnecessary exceptions:\nhttps://gist.github.com/holgerd77/8230bd00182ebb33fdf7669c9146ab3a\n\nI again think it's worth posting and so have put this into another gist.\n\nTo not fully leave you alone with thinking about AI stuff I will give some first-round estimates, these might be limited though, not fully sure if I have internalized all parts of the spec well enough (but who knows 😁):\n\n**1a. Unified Change Detection Rule **: Can't fully judge.\n**1b. Merge storage_reads and storage_changes Into a Single Ordered List**: This seems highly beneficial to me regarding unification, not seeing any downsides atm.\n**1c. Always Record COINBASE balance_change**: Smaller, can't fully judge but likely worth to consider.\n\n**2a. Drop All Net-Zero / No-Op Filtering**: Can't fully judge.\n**2b. Record Only the Final Value Per Storage Slot Per Block**: Also can't fully judge.\n**2c. Decouple Access Tracking From State Diffs**: Larger structural change, but if \"this holds\", this would be a large win for the spec.\n\n//cc <@792404665068158998> <@508125616940515329>",

    "content": "I'll give the gist an in-depth look later today, for section 2 the Radical ideas: just want to mention we try to keep the BAL a good balance between effectiveness and size. Dropping certain filtering (like remove no-changes) will increase the BAL size (not sure by how much, but likely can now add items for the cold sload cost of 2100). For 2b. this reduces the size of the BAL, but it removes the possibility to be able to run txs in parallel (one can calculate the pre-state of any tx in the block if you have the access list and access to the storage trie of the block this block refers to), which is one of the main goals/unlocks of the EIP 😄",

    "content": "Yes, I get that, the proposals are not all about filter drops though.\n\n1b is a structural clean-up (with a very small size increase) which I think might be worth to consider.\n\n2c is a more radical suggestion to rethink the overall data structure, if this holds hough (and not throwing out cases I am overlooking right now) it would a) reduce BAL size and b) preserve parallelization capabilities and c) significantly ease implementation.\n\nBut for sure needs some time to think this through and judge. 🙂 Maybe also worth doing some experiments if first analysis holds.",
