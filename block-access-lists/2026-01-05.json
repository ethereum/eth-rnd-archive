However, if the target account has delegated to another and we have enough gas to cover all the call-related costs with the exception of the EIP-2929 access costs for resolving the delegated account code, what do we do?\n\nI would say in this case, for the sake of consistency we should record the state access for the authority account but not the delegated account.",

So, I'd still keep the breakout (no strong opinion) until the final design is locked in and only move over entirely after that. \nFor that, we need a client (or better multiple) that has the batch IO optimizations implemented, which is on its way.",
