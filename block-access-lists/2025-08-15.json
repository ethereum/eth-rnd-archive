        "content": "One other reason that reads may not be that useful for speeding up execution:  if the state root calculation overhead dominates the block execution, it doesn't matter if we squeeze some extra performance out of the EVM execution.\n\nIn Geth, the initial performance numbers support this.  However, we are still optimizing things (especially state root calculation) so I can't say with 100% certainty just yet.",
