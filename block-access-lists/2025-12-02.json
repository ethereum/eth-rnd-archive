I think there is an error in eest and other clients:  in the case where a create targets an account that already exists, the account is not being included as a read in the BAL.  Example of this is `paris/eip7610_create_collision/initcollision/init_collision_create_tx.json` where the account `0bd9880ecaea49ad90b4f001d4fe4c1930d18d67` is the target of a creation, which fails because there is already a contract at that address.",
