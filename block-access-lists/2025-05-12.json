It seems like some of the LOGged data (either in receipts or in the logs themselves for ETH transfers) is relevant data for the BAL also. So it seems that such data could be read from the receipts/logs (and thus does not have to be \"duplicated\" in the BAL)\n\nAlso the system logs EIP https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7799 has the idea to pay priority fees to coinbase after all txs have executed. This would remove the priority fee transfers from the BAL 🤔",
