Since around 30% txs are simple eth transfers, we may often be able to skip sender + recipient in the balance diff. I ran the numbers and this reduces their size by and avg. of 1.8KiB (total of 38 KiB on avg), so quite worth it. \nEssentially, we would take all addresses with balance diffs that were caused by simple eth transfers where that address was either the sender or the recipient (or the feeRecipient) out of the BAL in case there is no other non-statically-inferable balance change.\nhttps://github.com/nerolation/EIPs/blob/281f88facd65c9d31a0ff534be2c2bbb0b55208f/EIPS/eip-7928.md#:~:text=Simple%20ETH%20transfers%20with%20a%20gas%20limit%20and%20usage%20of%2021%2C000%20MUST%20NOT%20contribute%20to%20a%20balance%20change%20of%20the%20sender%20and%20recipient.%20For%20them%2C%20all%20information%20required%20is%20statically%20available%20through%20the%20block.",
