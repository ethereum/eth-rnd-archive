This release fills all tests from previous forks for Amsterdam with block-level access lists. There's a very good chance this will reveal edge cases / discrepancies in specs and implementations across clients but this should hopefuly help us all align and sniff out where these discrepancies remain.\n\nIt also includes updates to the BAL-targeted test cases we have been working on _for_ EIP-7928 including updates to the coinbase logic we discussed in the breakout, tests for withdrawals, and some more account access, precompile, and storage tests.\n\nAs always, update here with any questions on issues you run into.",
