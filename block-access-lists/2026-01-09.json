While this isn't spec-related - it would be great to have as it allows us to measure how much we eventually get from batch IO + parallel exec vs only parallel exec.\nThe latest spec changes included moving the BAL out from the EL block and the retention period for storing it. Additionally we should already have the [json rpc methods](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/726) ready for devnet 2.",
