However, let's say this was only an `SSTORE` (no `SLOAD`) with exceptional halt, `SSTORE` still reads the slot for gas calculation. In this case, I would assume that the read slots are still recorded but perhaps we can make this explicit in the EIP. Thoughts \u003c@792404665068158998\u003e?",

        "content": "Actually the clarification is necessary for this test as well because `SLOAD` is done on slot `1` but `SSTORE` is for slot `2`, which should read it for gas calculation even though no storage write is done due to exceptional halt. The test expects both slots, `1` and `2`, in the reads. I believe most clients are including only slot `1` from the `SLOAD` (at least this is the case for reth, other client logs are not descriptive enough). I think the test is correct and indeed the slot was read just not written to as per the EIP description here:\n\n\u003e Exceptional halts: Record the final nonce and balance of the sender, and the final balance of the fee recipient after each transaction. State changes from the reverted call are discarded, but all accessed addresses MUST be included. If no changes remain, addresses are included with empty lists; **if storage was read, the corresponding keys MUST appear in storage_reads.**\n\nPerhaps it could still benefit from some more explicit statement but I do think this is clear in the bold sentence here.",
