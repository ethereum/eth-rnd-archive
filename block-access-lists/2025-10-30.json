Next step is to move the entire feature branch to `ethereum/execution-specs` under branch `eips/amsterdam/eip-7928` rather than it being on a fork so we can make the next release from EELS. Refilled tests with the updated specs and these additional cases should be out very soon.\n\nThe specs also need to have some eyes with regards to when accounts are added to BAL with regard to certain contexts like call (see relevant conversation in thread [here](https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1432349632616337520/1433558775393947719)). It would be good to try to iron this out as well in the specs before the next release.",
