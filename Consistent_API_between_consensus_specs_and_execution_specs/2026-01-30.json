    "content": "I think both proposals are reasonable. However, they both implicitly suggest that the component responsible for building payloads also supports proof generation. That may well be the optimal design in the future, but currently, they are separate components. \n\nIn the first iteration, I propose that we keep things as simple as possible with the two components decoupled. The execution node acts as the payload builder with no changes to the pre-existing engineAPI, and zkboost acts as the proof verifier and generator, implementing only engine_newExecutionProof and engine_requestProofs. \n\nI think it's constructive to continue with these conversations as we build up a list of potential optimisations/modifications for future iterations.",
