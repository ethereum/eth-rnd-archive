Building censorship resistant financial software is high effort (`build_effort`) but, if successful, extremely effective in the fight against censorship (`build_effect`).\n2. Quitting Twitter is low effort (`twitter_effort`), but has a tiny impact on the censorship of speech in the world (`twitter_effect`).\n3. `build_effect / build_effort \u003e twitter_effect / twitter_effort`\n4. `twitter_effect / twitter_effort` doesn't cross your personal threshold of \"things worth doing\", but `build_effect / build_effort` does cross your personal threshold of \"things worth doing\".",
