In this scenario secrets are still encrypted in the Travis CI database.\n\nThe issue is valid only for public repositories not Private repositories. (In case of Private repository, Repository Owner has a full control on ability of someone to fork the repository.)\n\nTravis CI implemented a series of security patches starting on Sept 3rd that resolves this issue.\n\nAs a reminder, cycling your secrets is something that all users should do on a regular basis. If you are unsure how to do this please contact Support.\n\nTravis CI Team.\n```",
