        "content": "Super simple stuff. I have about a dozen “spaces” every time I open Twitter. Majority are influencers / market makers taking about doge or some other insignificant token they’re trying to pump. And in everyone without fail they end up trying to speak on blockchain fundamentals. 90% of it is misinformation. I’ve participated in a few BTC spaces with miners that are  proposing new geothermal mining ops in El Salvador. I always try to share info on the Ether Genesis Enigma mine in Iceland and if they’re serious maybe it’s a good idea to speak with the ppl who currently run the worlds  largest geothermal mine. But just broad topics like - what does eip1559 REALLY do. Dispel all of the misinformation about 1559. And maybe speak about validating and how to put your 32 staked ETH to work. I think a Twitter spaces on staking and EIP1559 would be incredible.",
