Right now PoW issuance is roughly 13,500 ETH/day. In comparison PoS issuance with 14M ETH staking is roughly 1,700 ETH/day ETH per day. So even with 14M ETH staking (for context we currently have 5.7M ETH staking) 1,700 ETH/day is roughly 8x less than 13,500 ETH/day and an 8x issuance reduction is the equivalent of three halvings in Bitcoin land.”",
