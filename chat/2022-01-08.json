We'd end up with a period of potentially significant state growth that cannot easily be alleviated (by a to-be-included EIP that just limits the state growth). Hpothetically though, if we had working to-be-included implementations of EIP-4444 _and_ state expiry, I wouldn't mind as much to get a little bit ahead of ourselves with the gas limit.\nSame goes for getting EIP-4488 in a few months before EIP-4444 (and keeping gas limit as-is). I would have little issue with that provided the conditions I mentioned are satisfied. Again, this is just how I (currently) feel about it; it's not like I make any decisions around here though 😉",
