As before, the objective is to bring new people into the core development and help to train valuable contributors. With the upcoming cohort, we are changing the name to EPF and also adding a mentorship component. We are looking for mentors from core Ethereum teams who will be open to helping fellows to overcome challenges and gain more speed. It's not 1-on-1 mentoring, only availability to answer questions and guide when participants need it. Mentors can propose a project for participants, for example, something your team is working on or an idea you'd like to tackle. \n\nWe hope to have at least 1 mentor from each client team.
