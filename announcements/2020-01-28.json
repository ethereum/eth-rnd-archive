Because this was a very isolated problem with the test generators, we've merged the fix into master and re-run the test generators _without_ cutting a new spec or test repo release.\n\nI think 95%+ of you pull down `tar.gz`  test files so I've updated `general.tar.gz` with the fixed vectors in the `v0.10.1` release.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-spec-tests/releases/tag/v0.10.1",
