        "content": "Hi @everyone \n\nToday, we are going to expand the Eth R\u0026D server scope to include what has previously been discussions relegated to the \"allcoredevs\" gitter channel. You'll note a new \u003c#745077610685661265\u003e chat as the primary room for this conversation as well as a new \"eth1\" category which will be populated with some subchannels.\n\n\"eth1\" as opposed to \"eth1x\" and \"eth2\" is for _technical_ conversations related to immediate matters of Ethereum mainnet. For example, discussions around EIPs slated for an upcoming hardfork or a place to debug some deep fork recently seen on mainnet.\n\nThe additional of \"eth1\" is an experiment. We believe that the expansion of scope of the server will be a net benefit to all those involved in Ethereum layer-1 R\u0026D, but if any issues arise, we might consider splitting it off into a separate discord. I don't think this will be an issue, but _please_ keep things technical and keep things civil.\n\nWe also just added a new \u003c#745072678079168654\u003e channel with some loose guidelines on what this discord server is for and how to you should treat others while hanging out here. Nothing crazy. Just treat people with respect \n\nThank you for making this server a _huge_ success over the past many months \u003c:eth2:595693639913570305\u003e",
