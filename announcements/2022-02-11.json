If you'd like to subscribe, you can email announcements+subscribe@ethereum.org (check your spam for a confirmation email), or join at https://groups.google.com/a/ethereum.org/g/announcements for Google email users. \n\nNote: this is one more way to get pinged about this information, but will only share content posted on blog.ethereum.org related to network upgrades. As a reminder, the blog also has an RSS feed, and other sources obviously aggregate this information along with other Ethereum updates 😄",
