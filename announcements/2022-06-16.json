        "content": "**Important announcement:** the amount of messages in \u003c#745077610685661265\u003e  over the past few weeks has made it very hard for client teams and others working on The Merge to use it as a high signal communication channel. Because of this, after consulting with the EL + CL client teams, we've decided to make it read-only except for core contributors. \n\nOther channels in this discord of course remain open to all. If you are contributing to merge work and we've missed whitelisting you, please DM any of the \u003c@\u0026595685821026271242\u003e and we'll make sure to add you. \n\nIt's unfortunate to have to limit access to this channel, but given the trend of the past few weeks and high likelihood that the amount of noise keeps increasing as we go through Gray Glacier, testnet forks and finally mainnet, we think this is the best compromise to ensure communications keep happening in an open forum, without being derailed. \n\nOnce The Merge has passed, we’ll consult the client teams again and reevaluate whether having the channel open to all is more appropriate. Thanks for understanding!",
