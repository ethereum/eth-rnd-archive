This issue was cause by Sepolia's custom permissioned contract, which is different than mainnet. **All node operators must upgrade their nodes to the versions listed in this blog post: https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/03/05/sepolia-pectra-incident**\n\nValidators have already upgraded and the chain is now operating normally. It's possible that some explorers, wallets, or other infrastructure providers have issues until they also upgrade their nodes.",
