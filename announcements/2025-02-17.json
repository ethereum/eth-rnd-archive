The bot being used can be found here: https://github.com/ethpandaops/panda-pulse/ . The aim is to reduce human time in surfacing bugs/issues, especially across various feature devnets. \n\nThe bot is configured to look for certain alerts once a day, it then tries its best to group the alert into probable causes and creates a thread for each client that's affected. There are some debug information (like how to ssh into the nodes) that are also provided in threads.  Here's an example for pectra: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1340925563870908456\n\nWe're still beta testing the software, so please send us feedback. We're happy to tailor it more to what client devs need to actively debug. The bot however will be sending alerts, and hence spammy depending on your purpose for being on the server - we apologize for the noise, but please feel free to mute the entire channel for yourself. For client devs, please have a look at the channel once a day to help us fix bugs faster.",
