Please monitor blog.ethereum.org for announcements and be on the lookout for scams. The latest update is this one:\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/2022/03/14/kiln-merge-testnet/\n\nFrom the post: \n\n\u003e A date for the Ethereum mainnet proof-of-stake transition has not been set as of the publication of this post. Any source claiming otherwise is likely to be a scam. Updates will be posted on this blog. Please stay safe!\n\nGoing forward, we'll be more aggressive in deleting messages about this because they distract from the technical discussions in channels. Thanks!",
