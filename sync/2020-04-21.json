I *think* you are asking whether we need a way to try and ensure that clients are focusing on the same data.  I believe this would probably be addressable via extra-protocol mechanisms like an implementers guide with clear instructions on the \"proper\" client behavior.\n\u003e * What namespacing collisions is the 33rd byte of the keyspace trying to prevent?\nThe first 32 bytes are the `keccak(address)`.  Under this we need the ability to address into two sub-trees.  The contract storage, and the merklized code (projecting that we will do this).  In order to address unambiguously into the sub-trees we need an extra something to namespace the paths into those trees so we can easily differentiate whether something is referencing code or contract storage\n\u003e  Given that the hotspot is prefixed by a 32 byte pseudo-random value, wouldn't it take many epochs to have high probability of covering the entire trie? Do you see the length of the hotspot prefix being a tunable parameter while we develop the protocol or is there an important property to be conserved by keeping the prefix length the same as the block hash length that I'm not seeing?\nNothing importand about prefix length matching block hash length.  This is an area that needs more brains and thought but my general intention here would be for the protocol to take this into account and have the parameters tuned properly so that sync can happen \"optimally\" in optimal conditions with a very low probability that clients would have to wait around for the hotspot to land in the rarea of the tree they are waiting to finish.",
