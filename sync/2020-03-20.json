Do you see this as something that could be extended to how we transmit witness/proof data?  Basically, shouldn't it be possible to create  a witness for any of:\n\n- pure account data\n- mix of account data and contract storage data\n- pure contract storage data\n\nthis allows for us to just start treating the tries as if they are unified when transmitting proofs.",
