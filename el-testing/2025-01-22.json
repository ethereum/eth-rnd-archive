When passed through `newPayloadV4`, it shouldn't be expected to be processed. Currently erigon is failing 10 such tests.\nFurther, there is no mention of unknown request types errors in the specs, if that was the purpose of some of these tests.\nFor instance, `tests/prague/eip7685_general_purpose_el_requests/test_request_types.py::test_invalid_request_type[fork_Prague-blockchain_test_engine--no_data-include_valid_requests_False]`",
