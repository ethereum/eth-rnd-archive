Is this allowed?~~ is in the EIP, it is invalid\n2. I think the authorization list needs some extra validation, i.e. the address is 20 bytes, and the other values in the authorization list cannot exceed the max integer (otherwise this allows for arbitrary large nonces for instance)\n3. Why is the `address` which we add not added to the warm addresses? We need to read the code from this account, so it should be warm\n4. The gas costs do not charge to make `address` warm. Also, is the current 2500 `PER_CONTRACT_CODE_BASE_COST` does this also cover reading the `authority` address to make it warm?\n5. EIP-1559 is not in the required EIPs",
