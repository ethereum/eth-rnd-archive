Each time someone report a new case that broke something,  we cover more.\n\nActually the tests cover more situations that happen on main net. The guarantee here is that if you run them all, then you are in consensus with geth (generation  client)\n\nResearch here would be nice:\n- run code coverage analysis (see how well the code paths in evm logic are covered on different clients when running all the tests)\n- detect redundant tests",
