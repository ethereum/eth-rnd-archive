It doesn't seem at all critical to return the exact same error message, but hive just checks the diff of the text returned by the client. I implemented something in our fork of hive, which just checks that the response is an error, ignoring the message. Is this worth a PR? Or is there another take on error conformance that I'm not seeing?",
