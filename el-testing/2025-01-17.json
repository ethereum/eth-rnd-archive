I have claimed before that we pass all fixtures but those were only for the Prague tests, not for the CancunToPragueAtTime15k config. (Currently running those)\n\nSide-note, maybe for blockchain tests we want to start overhauling the network config format. We currently parse these \"special\" networks with a regex to figure out the config. Since the merge we have `XToYAtTimeZ` configs and before we had `XToYAtZ` where Z was a block number. I'm not sure if it's worth the effort though, but maybe in the future we want to tune these configs specifically for some specific timestamps / blocks (?)",
