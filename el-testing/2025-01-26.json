I can't seem to find the answer on this question: at the Merge, regarding the forkID as of https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2124.md did we hard-code a `FORK_NEXT` identifier for Merge-ready clients? (Since block/timestamp could not be calculated live back then?). It seems to be? https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675#eip-2124-fork-identifier\nDoes someone have a doc/code pointer to this? I checked out Geth releases from back in that time but it does not seem to include a hardcoded `FORK_NEXT`?",
