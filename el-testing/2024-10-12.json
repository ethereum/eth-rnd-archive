Hard-coding the index value which denotes the start of the bytes thus means that if the contract logs the event the bytes length is always of the same size 🤔",

It's a \"transaction\" checker which takes an RLP list of txs and verifies encoding / decoding integrity. e.g. to ensure that clients will reject transactions with a chain ID \u003e 2^64, we would encode such a special tx RLP and try to decode with t11s",
