To run these tests your client must have tooling which consumes the state/blockchain/eof tests JSON formats.\n\n\u003e I am currently trying blockchain tests, what EIPS do I need to activate? 😊\nAll EOF EIPs on top of Cancun should do (maybe on top of Prague as well, not sure, I'm working on top of Cancun with `evmone`)",
