I tried to run `./test.sh` and got a following error `./test.sh: line 32: ./hive: No such file or directory`                         Tried to run `./hive --sim ethereum/sync --client go-ethereum `, got\n`zsh: no such file or directory: ./hive.`   Can you advice please how I can run it locally to investigate how ti works internally?",
