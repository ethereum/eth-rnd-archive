        "content": "Consume is still a fairly new feature within EEST so we haven't fully announced it, as it needs a bit more testing and some documentation written. \u003c@547171287831805972\u003e came up with the idea during devconnect last year using \u003c@892053833121923094\u003e's python hive library. It allows us to easily update a test case, and then re-fill \u0026 execute against a fully instantiated client in one command - using hive dev mode as a back-end.\n\nWithin EEST we now have a set of 3 `consume` runners:\n- `consume direct`: wraps around client fixture execution binaries. Currently only for geth's `evm blocktest/statetest`.\n- `consume rlp`: uses hive as a back-end, equivalent to the `./hive consensus` simulator.  Executing blocks via rlp.\n- `consume engine`: also uses hive as a back-end, equivalent to the `./hive pyspec` simulator. Executing blocks as engine new payloads via the engine api.\n\nUltimately its going to lead to faster fixture updates from our side and give client teams an alternative way to run the fixtures.",
