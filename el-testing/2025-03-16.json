Also see the relevant discussion here: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1348653105239298111\n\nThe point is that EIP-6110 currently does not spec `parse_deposit_data` and I want to spec it so we can also write tests. We have seen on Sepolia the contract code for the deposit contract is different than the one on mainnet. This thus also means that the  `DepositEvent(bytes,bytes,bytes,bytes,bytes)` can emit event data with arbitrary byte length (as opposed to mainnet: the event signature is the same, but the actual data emitted is always of the same length). \n\nThere are two possibilities to spec it:\n\n1. Explicitly define in the EIP that the event itself should be ABI-decoded. The risk of this is that we enshrine the ABI in the protocol. \n2. Hardcode the offset/sizes to decode the data (this is in the PR). This currently works for the relevant networks (Mainnet, Sepolia) since the offsets/sizes of the data is the same. This does not enshrine the ABI in the protocol.\n\nAlso take in mind that by spec-ing (2) we also implicitly define that any other network which emits `DepositEvent` with different offset/sizes than Mainnet/Sepolia, this is not directly supported.\n\nAlso note that the EIP-7685 request data is of fixed sizes (see pic), thus if a new network would emit events with more data, then by the EIP it is not clear what slice of the data should go in the request, and thus also some event data will be lost.\n\nI think I favor (2) a bit more because this does not put ABI decoding in a core EIP.",
