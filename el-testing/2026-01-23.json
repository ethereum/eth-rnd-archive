So if this is _not_ implemented clients will not pass this with receipts root mismatches. This looks like it's in flux and should ideally be decided on ACDT. If this does change in the spec, we will release an updated version of the tests asap.\n\nedit: put up a [discussion point](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1882#issuecomment-3793080772) to try to get consensus on this by ACDT",
