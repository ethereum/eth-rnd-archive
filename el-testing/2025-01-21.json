I had the idea that this was intended for simple configs for future forks where we want to change the max/target blob gas.\n\nMy initial thought here would be that it would be nice, but it is not strictly necessary since we want to test the mainnet fork here. Obviously if similar networks want to fork but with different params it would definitely be a requirement to add these tests. \n\n(Will think about this a bit more and then reply on the GH PR also)",
