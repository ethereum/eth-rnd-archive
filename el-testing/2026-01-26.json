Major bump due to the breaking change from the early `bal-devnet-2` spec tests release - as agreed this morning on ACDT, there are now no changes to transaction receipts for EIP-7778. This release updates the EIP-7778 spec to reflect this and re-fills all tests. This should be up-to-date with the specs for `bal-devnet-2 ` now so please feel free to ping `@STEEL` if anything seems off 🙂",
