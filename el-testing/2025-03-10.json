As this would probably introduce some clients to just hardcode it, and that could also lead to some breaking changes down the line.",

A pre-defined config spec per chain (to the Fork Meta EIP?). iii. Tests that ensure they match. \n\nPersonally, I'd like to have both. But 1. adds quite a lot of overhead (all CI test infra and monitoring gets duplicated per testnet).",
