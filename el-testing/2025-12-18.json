I spent some time after devconnect working on setting up EL differential fuzzing for Besu, Netheremind and EVM via state-tests.\n\nHere's a blog about my current approach, which allows for **in-process, coverage guided fuzzing for all three** with each test case taking around 6-10ms on a laptop.\n Servers can go up to 2-3x the speed!\n\n\nFeedback/thoughts/suggestions welcome!\n\nhttps://r9295.github.io/posts/differential-fuzzing-accross-languages/",
