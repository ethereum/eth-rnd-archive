Not sure what is meant by \"yellow `stateRoot`\" here: https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blockchain-tutorial.html#tests-using-the-blockchain-random-value nor what to do in these new test cases.\n\nTrying to run these against a `py-evm` merge branch and all genesis + single block tests pass but genesis + multi-block tests fail because the `stateRoot` mismatch leads to differing block hashes + conflicts with expected `parentHash` of the next block.",

Now if you want a particular difficulty or random value overwritten for the test purposes, retesteth doesn't  know the state root, so you have to overwrite the stateroot too, the correct value will be returned by the client when filling the test",
