Blockchain tests feel the most logical because there is a facility to detect the rejection of a block as out-of-spec.  State-tests?  Not as good a facility. The trick is to ensure that the code section doing the rejection is the runtime code.  That's why engine tests are also a good place for it, no one is emulating engine parsing in their harneses.",
