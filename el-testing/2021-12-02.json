I understand that this is because the EL \"optimistically syncs forward (without setting head)\" and that \"in the future [I] would need a CL client\".\n\nWhich brings me to the question: is there a risk that some people who currently run e.g. geth, for their application, may believe that they are \"merge-ready\", when in fact they aren't? How can we make it easy for people to validate their \"merge-readiness\"?",
