        "content": "Hey \u003c@425274498732916736\u003e, very nice! Thanks for sharing, it would certainly make sense to make them available to other teams. I'll discuss with the team, but I think we could readily add an evmone build to our fixture release CI flow and generate them there (perhaps from a known, tagged version of evmone?). Added to: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/issues/360\n\nI'd suggest making the fixture names more verbose so that developers can locate the original unit test source more easily. And prefixing them with  `evmone`. In the next execution-spec-tests release, fixture names will correspond to the test file, function and parameters that generated the fixture, so it it can be located more easily, for example:\n```\ntests/berlin/eip2930_access_list/test_acl.py::test_access_list[fork_Berlin-blockchain_test]\n```\nI.e., `source_file::function_name[test_parameters]`\n\nJust copying in the process here for others to follow along (please comment if I missed something):\n```bash\nexport EVMONE_EXPORT_TESTS=exported_tests\nbuild/bin/evmone-unittests --gtest_filter=state_transition.\\*\nls exported_tests/state_transition/\n# -\u003e \n# block  create  eof  selfdestruct  trace  transient_storage  tx\n```",

So your part would be to download it and repackage.\n2. We can also provide some docker images so you can generate with docker instead of building evmone.",
