I made a small PR to extend test vectors for EIP 7883 here: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/1993\n\nI followed the contribution guide and made sure lint checks pass but the CI reports that the fill tests fail. This is my first contribution. Glad to have someone here help me out 🙏",
