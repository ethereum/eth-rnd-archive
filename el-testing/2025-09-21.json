        "content": "(TL;DR: Where is `nethermindeth/nethermind:gp-hacked` source code located?)\n\nHi all, I'm investigating worst-case scenarios when we bump the block gas limit to 60M in the context of doing a lot of heavy (read/)writes to the trie (targeting contracts with a big trie depth, like XEN). It seems like EIP-7935 will get an update to target 60M but without checking out these heavy situations I am not comfortable going to 60M yet. I am also focusing only on generating these reports at the moment, since we want to finalize the fork spec. I need help investigating these scenarios though:\n\nFor this I am using https://github.com/NethermindEth/gas-benchmarks. This uses a modified version of Nethermind to help create the payloads in order to run these tests: `nethermindeth/nethermind:gp-hacked`. I believe I have to slightly modify this tool, because it currently does not allow me to set the gas limit of the block to the desired limit (from 45M to 60M, only 100 payloads are generated to bump the gas limit which gives me a limit of 49M). I think the logic for this gas limit bump is in the modified Nethermind code. I can't find the source code for this though, Nethermind does not have a `gp-hacked` branch. I also checked if some developers forked the source but also cannot find it there. \n\nSince \u003c@889542182611083334\u003e published the `gp-hacked` to docker registry, could you maybe point me to the location where this source code is located? Or help me to get the gas limit bumps done correctly? I thus only get 100 gas limit bump payloads. I'd need this setup to start testing the target state-heavy scenarios.",

And maybe also disabling timestamp checks to allow timestamps in the future to be accepted/ran as payloads. Will stop for today, but if someone knows where the `nethermindeth/nethermind:gp-hacked` edits are that would  be very helpful 😄",
