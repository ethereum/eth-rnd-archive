What do you think? What are your preferences?\n\nIt would also be great to have a list of the people working on the mempool from different EL teams. From Geth side I'm currently on it.\n\nhttps://notes.ethereum.org/@cskiraly/mempool-scaling-blobs\n\nThe doc is very preliminary (I'm just back from holidays), but I plan to extend it in the next few days.",
