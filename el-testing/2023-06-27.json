Newer versions of YUL generate PUSH0, so the extraOpcodesGas either needs to go down by one or we need to tstore into not-zero.\n\nEverything elses is vanilla, except for the info blocks.\nIn the PR I also changed the network to Cancun, and you will see other gas deltas because of PUSH0.\n\nAt least the fillers can be used directly.",
