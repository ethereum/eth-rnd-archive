        "content": "Hello folks. I work on the OffchainLabs/nitro project. We are a fork of the go-ethereum project, and we noticed that our go-ethereum CI stopped working several hours ago with this error:\n```\ngo run build/ci.go test\nbuild/cache/fixtures_pectra-devnet-6.tar.gz is stale\ndownloading from https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/download/pectra-devnet-6@v1.0.0/fixtures_pectra-devnet-6.tar.gz\n10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%\nci.go:342: invalid file hash: 5ed3bec40a02776a4096c17b84b59fb20fd99fbabba8101fdac3d35a001cf82a fixtures_pectra-devnet-6.tar.gz\n```\nThis is almost certainly due to the accidental deletion of the `pectra-devnet-6@v1.0.0` release from the execution-spec-tests repository. But, I'm *nervous* about just updating the `checksums.txt` file because it seems like it could be a possible way that a compromised GitHub admin account for the `execution-spec-tests` repo could be trying to get me to run some arbitrary code on my CI machines or my development machine.\n\nCan someone confirm that this release https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/releases/tag/pectra-devnet-6%40v1.0.0 is legitimate in spite of the checksum changing and the release not being from a \"verified\" source?",
