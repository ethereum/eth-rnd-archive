Once pr 6894 merges (soon), it will simplify the diff to be a single parameter change for these tests to pass.\n\nIt is the snap protocol tests that we are failing the majority of due to response expectations.\n\nThere are a couple sources of difference for besu return counts/sizes when responding to snap requests.  The main issue is that, besu storage layer and apis make it cost prohibitive to honor exact soft request size limits, mostly due to the difference in encoding size between rlp and raw.  \n\nThe second source of diff is easier to address, we are sending raw empty code hash and empty root hash.  We can/will fix this account encoding, and that should get us closer to the hive snap test expectations.",
