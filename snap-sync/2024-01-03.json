        "content": "Hey, team! I have a flat-database related question I thought I'd ask here since flatDB is related to snap sync: I've been discussing an idea for modifying the current WIP flatDB implementation happening for the ethereumjs execution client to not hash account and slot keys when putting or getting them in and from the flat database in order to preserve the key preimages for having access to them for the verkle transition as well as for being able to support things like dumping storage from a deployed contract for creating alloc data for `genesis.json` files. The idea would be to skip hashing account and slot keys during the database key generation process and instead only hashing them when needed for e.g. calculating roots using the stackTrie (where hashed key-value leaf data is needed for root calculation). I wanted to see if there are any thoughts on it or potential blockers with this idea that are not being noticed or if it has already been tried perhaps.",
