Without block download (because geth can sync with ancients intact from earlier), the account/storage snap download phase took on the order of 12 hours. \n```\nsynced=100.00% state=198.53GiB accounts=187,249,438@41.75GiB slots=765,336,548@152.83GiB codes=654,682@3.95GiB\n```\nThe heal-phase depends heavily on 1) IO performance and 2) amount of peers. Too many peers overload the cli right now (we're working on it). For our more beefy aws-machines, we can usually do the whole thing in 12 hours. Can dig up some charts per phase for those later",

So you only got the account in between. And thus the proof needs to show that indeed, following the trie downwards towards X leads to a dead end, trie-path-wise. \n\nDid I misnunderstand the question?",
