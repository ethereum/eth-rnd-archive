What if I do a `GetAccountRange` request and the other node responds with only one key/value pair. I have requested left key X and right key Y. How do I know that whatever key Z gets reported, there are no trie items between X and Z? This is not included in the proof (right?). The only case I could see this work failsafe is when X === Y? (Or is there some internal conversion within the devp2p layer?) Thanks 🙂",
