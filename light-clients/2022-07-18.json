Storing block bodies in Portal reduces the space needed, and that's the simplest part of Portal I think (the block bodies are effectively just simple files without complicated latency requirements or structure). But the battery will be drained if it's trying to keep up with the network. The computations are too intensive to run all day, and the constant radio communications will also drain the battery.",
