Anything else is heuristics based.\n\nThe only time when you can _realistically_ get stuck following that, is:\n– no finality for an entire sync committee period\n– low sync committee participation (\u003c 2/3) for an entire sync committee period\nIf your use case cannot fallback to an alternate syncing mechanism to cover such edge case periods, you need a heuristic to avoid getting stuck.",
