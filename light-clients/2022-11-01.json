Suppose I am some blockchain, and I have an honest relayer who keeps pushing me the Sync committee public keys every day (Sync committee period). Then I can just deploy a Smart Contract on my chain with the updated Sync committee addresses, and can verify Ethereum blocks on chain. Does anyone see any limitation with this approach?",

Or somebody from the project I could chat with?",
