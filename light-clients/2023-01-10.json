The JSON format is not yet part of a tagged `beacon-APIs` release.\n– The `{beacon: ...}` wrapper is part of the LC data upgrade that extends with execution data (https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3151)\n   So, the change to the wrapper would need to be done eventually anyway (latest with Capella).\n– Doing the change also in the Altair logic means that https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3150 is not required anymore, so saves on complexity longterm.\n\nPersonally, think could just yolo this one before adoption is too widespread to change this.\nDatabase formats remain same. SSZ gossip remains same. It is just the JSON that has a change.",
