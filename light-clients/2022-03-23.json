An observer is not able to differentiate between a valid fork with a drop in participation and a malicious fork / genuine censorship / manipulation. Here it requires a honest majority assumption be it 2/3, 1/2, etc. Given this requirement it's important to fetch this data from a decentralized network which can give you this assurance.\n\n- **Data w/ proofs**: Once ensuring consensus on a block hash, query any data that can be proved from it. This includes bootstrap LightClientStore, proofs in the consensus state, and proofs in the execution state. Here it just requires a 1 of many honest assumption. You can be censored but you can not consume invalid data. You can connect to many data providers and suffice for one to share your view of the chain and don't censor you.\n\nI believe then we should separate concerns and push to boostrap a network that satisfies exclusively the consensus part. Portal network can decentralize the latter eventually",
