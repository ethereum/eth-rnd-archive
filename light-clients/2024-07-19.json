I don't think so. it might be possible to see the number of helios downloads from github somehow. but that does not relate to the number of light nodes running. \n2. not to my knowledge. the full nodes don't store the lightclient data /request count. \n\nit is probably useful to see this data somewhere. but in my opinion the design of light clients, which are not meant to stay online, but to just become online on demand, makes it difficult and maybe not even meaningful to obtain such metrics. \n\nbut hypothetically, full nodes could store the number of requests served to unique light nodes per day or some period of time.",
