There is some interest in understanding the benefits and requirements for some of this stuff, especially the slashing component as we _think_ a lot of hesitancy in using this part of the protocol is due to the low security assurances. Ideally before next ACDC if you can participate . Thinking about March 6 @ 1400 UTC.",
