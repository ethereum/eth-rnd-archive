I am not clear that if the Sync Committee signs the tip of the chain or the last Finalised Header? How can there be a case where the Finalised Header is not defined and the Attested Header is the Finalised Header? \nthe sync committee signature in a block is always signing over the previous block root\n\nseparately, a light client can request an update and if the provider wants to provide finality information they can w/ the finalized header, but it is optional\n\n\u003e 2. I don't see the spec changes for blockProposer on how the Sync Committee signatures are handled. Eg.  Does blockProposer only consider the attestation that he would agree as the last block?  Also what other checks does the blockProposer makes\nthe details are here: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/validator.md\nin short, the producer aggregates sync committee signatures that match their view of the chain and includes them in their block\n\n\u003e 3. I don't see the spec changes in the attestation rules. Eg. given that I am in the Sync Committee which header do I sign, etc\nthe sync committee responsibility is bit distinct from the attestation responsibility, as part of the sync committee you sign over the previous block root as validated here: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#sync-aggregate-processing",
