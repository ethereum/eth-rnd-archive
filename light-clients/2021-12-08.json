You have to serialize and merkleize the `beacon_state` object and then grab the hashes in each of the nodes connecting the `sync_committee` to the state root in the merkelized state object. This is to enable a proof that the sync committee signed off the block. The leaf representing the `sync_committee` can be located from its generalized index. The `finality_header` is the block header if the block has been finalized.",

You can specify `Accept: application/octet-stream` to get the data as SSZ which is significantly cheaper for the beacon node (and smaller), but it's still a pretty big sledge hammer.  For an initial implementation it's probably fine but for production we should add an endpoint to get specifically the data required if there isn't already one.",
