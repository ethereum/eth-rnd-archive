Seems like a potential attack vector especially if the client is really resource-light (easy and cheap to attack using many clients). \n\nLevels 1 and 2 make sense to me, but they seem like consecutive stages in a development roadmap rather than a design choice to make at the outset (i.e. develop level 1 light client w client/server model then swap in p2p gossiping later).",
