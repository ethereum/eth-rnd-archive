Comments:\n\n  - there are a number of occasions where all 512 votes were present in the block (yay)\n    - including the first slot of the period (double yay)\n  - some clients seem to have a much lower inclusion rate than others (surmising through the chunking of vote frequency)\n  - there is no obvious \"beginning of epoch\" problem with a reduction in votes for lower slot-in-epoch blocks\n\nRaw data and graphs are at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xatADifGpQnrgDP81uVjvmpklzLzpG4N_5ay4KGirFI/edit?usp=sharing",
