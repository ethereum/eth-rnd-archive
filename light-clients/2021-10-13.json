        "content": "for those who missed the call just now, me and some of the CDAP participants chatted about the relationship b/t a beacon chain (consensus) light client and the efforts towards building the portal network; i think our main takeaway was that they are trying to accomplish slightly different things and that the overall design space is quite big 🙂  i think the CDAP'ers on the call are going to think a bit more about what they want to tackle during their cohort, chatting w/ them raised some  questions about how we are going to proceed w/ bootstrapping beacon chain light clients and i intend to write up some notes on this front soon",
