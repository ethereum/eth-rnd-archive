I made a proposal at the light clients workshop at Devcon regarding this, hoping to consolidate some feedback from people working in the light client dev ecosystem about how to go about this. Unfortunately, the audio did not get recorded, but here are the slides from the presentation:\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fKfsGYEYoLWoZGFjtKeLjSU8wa8GRx1brf9CvMu1LWU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTL;DR: I'm looking to see how we can better persist, discuss and collaborate all our efforts in this part of the ecosystem and to create a better DevEx for those looking to contribute to this effort. I'm going to start with creating a wiki of information (likely using Notion) about this ecosystem, what people are working on and references to everyone's contributed efforts.\n\nCurrently, we have a github repo (https://github.io/ethereum-light-clients), Twitter (https://twitter.com/ethlightclients), Telegram Announcements (https://t.me/+vKomz6woYTBkNGIx), Discord (this channel) and central domain (https://lightclients.xyz) - which will likely become the new wiki page.",
