        "content": "hmm, not sure about bumping just for the sake of bumping, as it means work for eip-4788 based smart contracts. agree on it just being a delay, though, we'll likely need more than 32 at some time. still better to use sth like 7688 to bump all of the container limits at the same time, rather than breaking an individual one every other fork.\n\nanother aspect to consider is that a sub-container allows extending this part lateron with new validator request specific fields, nicely grouping them together. with the append-only nature of `BeaconState`, if a new validator request gets introduced, its field would be fragmented from the rest.\n\npersonally fine with either, slight preference for the subcontainer just to avoid adding work for eip-4788 folks (even if they are not many). means we could also get rid of Electra specific LC logic in our own specs until other changes actually require a new fork spec.",
