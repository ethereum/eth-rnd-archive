They also do this for other L1s, Will try to see if Daniel from POKT is in this channel and connect you, but he can give his POV on it.",

But high-level, we've been running a public endpoint serving light client APIs for devs to use when working on their projects. It's very much a service we altruistically provide to help people but there's no other real incentive for other people to run one. Its always been a challenge to figure out how to incentivize people to run these endpoints for distribution, but for now the spec seems to be solid enough that all the consensus client teams have signalled to implement it in their clients",
