        "content": "At fork boundaries, for at least the first two epochs (until an epoch in the new fork finalizes) we have a situation where the attested light client header and finalized light client header for light client objects can be from different forks.\n\nWhen requesting light client data over rpc, we use  the consensus version header to decode the correct lc variant. And when receiving lc data over gossip we use the fork digest.\n\nThis causes issues at fork boundaries because the consensus version header/fork digest isn't enough to correctly decode a lc object. We've put a fallback in place to where if decoding fails for the attested/finalized lc header we return our \"default\" header value (i.e. everything zeroed out) \n\nWe were debating not computing/gossiping light client data at fork boundaries until an epoch in the new fork finalizes \n\nWe can also fallback  to the previous fork variant if ssz decoding fails.\n\nNot sure theres a better solution here, and its a pretty small edge case. Was wondering how other teams were handling this",
