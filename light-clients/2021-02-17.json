I am not sure why `BeaconBlockBody.sync_committee_bits` and `BeaconBlockBody.sync_committee_signature` are not set anywhere (they are only read from in `process_sync_committee`), and although `SyncCommittee.pubkey_aggregates` is used to create a new `SyncCommittee`, the field is not read from anywhere.",
