It says:\n\n\u003e If the light client sees a valid LightClientUpdate containing a finality_header, and with at least 2/3 of the sync committee participating, it accepts the update.header as the new snapshot header. Note that the light client uses the signature to verify update.finality_header (which would in practice often be one of the most recent blocks, and not yet finalized), and then uses the Merkle branch from the update.finality_header to the finalized checkpoint in its post-state to verify the update.header. If update.finality_header is a valid block, then update.header actually is finalized.\n\nWhat does \"uses the Merkle branch from the update.finality_header to the finalized checkpoint in its post-state to verify the update.header\" mean? It's a bit confusing.",
