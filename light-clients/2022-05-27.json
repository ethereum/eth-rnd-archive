It is just that no mechanism was specified to actually make the data available in a form useful for light clients. So, technically, light client support is not tied to the merge.\n– re (2), the light client cannot \"verify that a supermajority of all staked eth has attested the tip of the chain\" as it cannot validate the majority of the signatures because light clients do not have access to all the validator keys. How the light client sync works, is that on a ~daily basis 512 validators get elected as members of the \"sync committee\". They are expected to only sign as part of the sync committee when they have fully locally verified that the block is good, earning a reward for doing this well. This allows the light client (that knows about the sync committee) to delegate the full verification work to the sync committee members – if a high number of sync committee participants claims that the chain tip is valid, the light client will trust it.\n– There may be reasons other than censorship that a transaction may not be included. Simple example would be one with a very low fee.\n- The sub-20-ms-latency claim seems to be a very specific number but lacks a source",
