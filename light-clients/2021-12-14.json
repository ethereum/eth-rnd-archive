It is still in POC stage.\n\nI implemented the most recent sync-protocol, as described in this post (https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/extended_light_client_protocol) and described in this consensus-spec pr: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2746.\n\nThe code is still in POC stage. But both the server and light-client should be fully functioning. Those who are interested on how the light client works could play around with it to better understand where the spec stands today and what is needed for the next steps.\n\nCode is here: https://github.com/jinfwhuang/prysm/pull/5\n\nIn short the sync-protocol is 90% there. The most obvious next step is to discuss and define a networking layer.",
