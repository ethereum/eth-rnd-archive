        "content": "the other thing I think is that weak subjectivity is but one part of the spectrum - ie it protects against one form of attack which needs to be weighted against other risks - pulling off that attack in actual reality is .. difficult, given how many keys you must end up taking over / controlling, then regenerating a new reality - one could argue though that the more people rely on infura, the more uniquely positioned they become to actually get it done - not to cast doubt on the trustworthiness of infura today, but the world has changed in more surprising ways in the past.\nPer the infura argument, without any further verification, if infura was indeed a safe choice always, by extension one could keep getting the state from infura for every slot and attest this way - or indeed, all validators can rely on infura for their beacon.",

        "content": "One thing is that a compressed beacon chain is about 9mb now and will maybe double after more validators join - it's a 10s transfer on any modern network - bittorrent may be .. overkill - the world will become a lot more interesting once we have actual data to transfer - the security problem isn't _really_ getting the state - it's trusting that it's the correct one, and that boils down to having a good source to trust in the first place and the mechanisms we have available to verify that trust",
