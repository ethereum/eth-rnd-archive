        "content": "Hey - we're looking for teams interested in exploring an ETH light client implementation on the Internet Computer (IC). Smart contracts (Canisters) on the IC are WASM modules, so Rust implementations (like Helios) could provide a good starting point. Canisters can also do HTTP calls (e.g. to RPC endpoints) and can do scheduled calls, hence there's room to explore solution with and without relayers. \nhttps://github.com/dfinity/grant-rfps/issues/25",
