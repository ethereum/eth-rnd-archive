I'd like to also discuss with you and more broadly with people here what use cases this portion of the protocol is actually useful for in the long-term with end-users (not just engineers)... given the current constraints we have on the security threshold of it. What can people do with the light client protocol now or into the future with the current state of this design? I'm a little hesitant on dedicating more resources here if we're not clear on who's actually using/building on light clients and what their main concerns + needs are from the protocol.",
