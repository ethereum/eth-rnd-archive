Let us know if you want more detail:\n\nThis talk would outline our experience building a Halo2 prover/verifier that can verify BW6 groth16 proofs efficiently on Ethereum, allowing us to verify Celo's Plumo light client proofs efficiently on Ethereum.\n\nWith Celo transitioning to an L2 and validators transitioning to decentralized sequencers, this light client would transition to an efficient way to determine the Celo decentralized sequencer set on Ethereum. (re @Phil_ngo: No official form as of right now. Feel free to pitch/signal it in here and when we organize the schedule we’ll reach out!)",
