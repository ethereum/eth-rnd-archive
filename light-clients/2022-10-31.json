Ethereum is just one \"chain ID\", so if it's a simple JSON RPC call that's part of the RPC spec [1], it should be handled transparently. If it depends on the client implementation, and not exposed by every client, then would need to be a protocol level separation between different ETH clients and the problem becomes less trivial.\n\nWill reach out to \u003c@178652431868100609\u003e directly as well to discuss in more detail.\n\n[1] https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/\n[2] https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients",
