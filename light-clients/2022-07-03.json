        "content": "The API to request proofs for CL data is part of https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/181 (see `proof.yaml`). The current Lodestar implementation returns a `persistent-merkle-tree` format (https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz/tree/master/packages/persistent-merkle-tree). Nimbus does not support the proofs endpoint at this time.\n\nAPI to request end-to-end proofs for EL data is not specced out yet, but functionality can be emulated by using the existing `eth_getProof` EL API, and combining it with a proof for `signedBeaconBlock.message.body.execution_payload.state_root` rooted in the latest CL block, and then combining that with a matching `LightClientOptimisticUpdate` (and potentially a `parent_root` chain proof) to infer trust for the CL block. I'll be working on an API that short-circuits this mechanism after the current light client work is adopted.",
