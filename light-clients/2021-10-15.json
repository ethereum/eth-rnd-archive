        "content": "basic question regarding sync committees via the altair spec. when the next sync committee is selected, it's possible for duplicate validator indices to exist if there is a small validator set of \u003c 512 + 128. in practice, is there a situation where there would ever be a validator set that small, or is that just a general safety measure? put differently -- the active(?) validator set is around 250k right now, which would be the validator pool size the sync committee is being selected from...nothing close to the \"small set\" of 640 validators. just trying to understand the comment in this function: https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/altair/beacon-chain.md#get_sync_committee_indices",
