It addresses some issues that \u003c@!688748669268132001\u003e raised based on their experiences in building a light client demo in lodestar. I also think that the same data types should be adopted for the rpc approach as well. For those who are interested, please review https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/pull/102",
