        "content": "Interesting! That opcode will actually unlock a lot more use cases related to verifying data from the Beacon Chain. Is that EIP going to be considered for Dencun or in the subsequent hardfork as it has not been included in this document: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/cancun.md\n\nThat makes sense, also, if the slasher is going to be a seperate actor who is not integral to the Beacon Chain's progression, is it possible to run into cases where there are no individuals running a sync committee slasher for the entirety of the current sync period and the sync committee is able to produce signatures for non-canonical block roots and get away without getting slashed?",
