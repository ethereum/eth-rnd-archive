It's not a perfect design, but we're going to be iterating on a few other verification mechanisms soon. Lots of more info in my post (https://x.com/NoahCitron/status/1849829449166094582). I'll also be talking at devcon about more advanced strategies for L2 light client verification, but if anyone wants to jam on ideas before then feel free to DM.",
