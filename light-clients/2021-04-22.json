        "content": "That would be an interesting way to verify the state root. Personally I’m not convinced that the p2p network is a particularly good way to distribute the state itself. Nodes already have fairly high traffic requirements and having to distribute the state to other peers is an additional burden. Plus there’s no reason for validator nodes to store finalised states. \nWhereas it is really well suited to http downloads if you are ok with a trust but verify kind of approach. Ie I’m going to trust that they give me something valid and so I don’t waste time downloading junk (reasonable if your picking something like Infura or a block explorer to download from but not safe to trust from random p2p peers). Then you can verify the block root manually by comparing with some block explorers or potentially via the light client sync protocol.  Being able to automate that check would be very useful.",
