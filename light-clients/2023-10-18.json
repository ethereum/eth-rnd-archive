Although to use discovery requires a small change for clients which support light client servers, so its just a matter of updating the networking spec for it with the change.\n\nWithout discovery, you would have to connect with random nodes to determine which gossipsub topics they are subscribed to and using that determine if you want to stay connected or not to them",
