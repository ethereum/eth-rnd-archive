So let's break down each area:\n**Spec**\nAt the protocol level the altair spec is quite final at this point, \u003c@881905303011086387\u003e should it acknowledged somewhere? There are initiatives like adding slashing but those are far from consensus\n**Protocol adoption**\nThe major implementations don't have stable support yet to serve lightclient data via p2p or API, which hinders adoption a bit. Hopefully an EPF fellow could bridge that gap!\n**Lightclient impl**\nThere's been really nice progress in the last year, a16z/helios and lodestar/prover can be used today by JSON RPC consumers.",
