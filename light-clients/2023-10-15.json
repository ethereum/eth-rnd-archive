There are 6 consensus clients and they are all Altair compliant, despite the spotty light client protocol support. We started building some light client server support in Lighthouse, but gave up when it turned out to be more complicated, more onerous (extra compute \u0026 data) and less useful than originally thought. IMO the fact that light client messages aren't slashable severely limits its usefulness. My (personal) hot take is that we should never have bothered with the Altair light client features, and should have waited until people tried to build light clients, and could integrate their feedback into the protocol. Now that we've got the Altair light client protocol, I think we should fix it (make sync committee messages slashable), and roll out optional support.\n\nAlternatively, we give up, delete the sync committees and let people do cool stuff like this: \u003chttps://ethresear.ch/t/zkcasper-a-snark-based-protocol-for-verifying-casper-ffg-consensus/15559\u003e.",
