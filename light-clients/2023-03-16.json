(re @Lightclient_bot: \u003cRadek\u003e Hi \u003c@881905303011086387\u003e , we briefly discussed light client support in Prysm during the Austria interop. After some discussions within the team, we decided that we are not going to build a light client implementation at the moment. However we do want to support light client in our beacon node. Apart from the specs, are there any more useful resources that I can read to get up to speed?)",
