        "content": "Hi,\n\nI want to make a pitch for inclusion in the light client summit presentations - \n\nThis is Garvit from Electron. We are building a ZK-prover for full ethereum consensus. For many use cases, folks are relying on the Altair Light Client, which inherits limited Ethereum security. This is because the full Ethereum consensus node is computationally expensive to run. Hence, we want to \"zk-compress\" this, such that it can become cheap to verify full ethereum consensus.\nWe have also written a draft paper on this, and I am happy to share it in case it helps with our application 🙂\n\nCompany twitter - https://twitter.com/labs_electron",
