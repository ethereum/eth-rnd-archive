        "content": "Hi, I have implemented the beacon chain light client in C# that is ready for use. It uses a modified version of the Lodestar beacon chain client for the server part. The light client is still in the early phase as there are a number of improvements need to be made to its codebase. This includes being able to remain synced with the beacon chain when the sync committee changes. Here is the repository link: https://github.com/uink45/Beacon-Chain-Light-Client-Prototype",
