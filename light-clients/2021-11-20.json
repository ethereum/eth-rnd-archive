        "content": "Hi, I am trying to build a C# implementation of a beacon chain light client. I came across the constants `FINALIZED_ROOT_INDEX `and `NEXT_SYNC_COMMITTEE_INDEX`, that are calculated using the `get_generalized_index` function. The value of these constants is pre-computed in Lodestar's implementation of the light client. Am I supposed to reuse these values for my implementation or should I get them from the `get_generalized_index` function?",

        "content": "Hi Mihir. \n\nWhat I’ve realized is that most of the verbiage used within Lodestar[Typescript] will correlate heavily within the chosen language you’re using to build.\n\nFor example, the `Vector\u003c\u003e` function within Lodestar’s light-client was essentially `SszVector\u003c\u003e` within the Teku[Java] client I’m using to build my Java version of the light-client, so I just imported that function into my light-client build.\n\nHope this helps.",
