One thing I've been wondering though is why we actually need light clients attached to all the full clients - couldnt a light client be agnostic to the full client it queries, since it is just making http requests? I guess it makes sense from a client diversity perspective, and each full client will need to be modified to serve the light client requests anyway so perhaps that is good enough reason.",
