Supply-chain attacks (which for Ethereum are somewhat mitigated by the multi-client approach), DDoS vectors, etc. Probably best to look at ethresear.ch, and similarly scoped discussions on the GitHub consensus specs repo. Here's a paper (draft) by EF researchers on three possible attacks for the current PoS of Ethereum: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10086.pdf",
