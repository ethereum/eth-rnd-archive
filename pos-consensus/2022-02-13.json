So with 33% of the total balance a rocket pool operator would effectively hold 66% and be likely able to finalize a block of his choice. In the case of custodial pools this is extreme",

        "content": "Bit of a tangent, but this is potentially misleading.  Even if you have 2/3rds of the validator balance you can't finalize any block. The blocks still must be valid or they'll all be rejected by other nodes.  You can chose which valid fork finalizes which is still not something we want centralised, and I think that's what you were meaning. But it's always good to be clear that every node on the network is a \"validating\" node in that they validate every block they receive and reject any that don't follow the protocol.",
