To avoid inconsistency between pyspec and static language implementations, #1746 (https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1746) is about making the Python typing more explicit and bounded with `remerkleable` SSZ internal checks around `uint`. (Thanks to \u003c@!203220829473996800\u003e and \u003c@!600991921275535360\u003e )\n\nTo avoid other ambiguity, I also created #1935 (https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1935), which includes phase 0 `int_to_bytes` refactoring change. I fully understand it’s a bad time to increase overhead for client teams and I suppose this scope of this change depends on how do clients handle `int_to_bytes` implementation currently. If you have time, please take a look, especially, let me know if you hate it! 😄",
