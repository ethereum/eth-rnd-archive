In one of the chapter, the author said that in the case of bitcoin, since people are mining in pools instead of mining alone, it can be regarded as \"delegated\" PoW instead of PoW. Thinking about PoS, would the fact that people staking in \"pool\" through services like Coinbase and Lido make it \"delegated\" PoS? If so, how is it different from DPoS imolemented in cardano and polkadot?",
