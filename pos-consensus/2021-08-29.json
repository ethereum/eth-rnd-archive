In \u003c@!273808422753796097\u003e's annotated spec (https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/altair/beacon-chain.md#misc-1) we have a value of `Epoch(2**9) (= 512)` but in (I think) the current spec the value is `uint64(2**8) (= 256)` (see https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#sync-committee).\n\nI'm guessing this is just a change that was made since the last update of the annotated spec, is that right?",
