        "content": "Are there plans to keep the ice age concept under PoS? In the current form it will not really work after the merge, as PoW difficulty will disappear. But I would argue that the concept itself is one of the most important safeguards to keep the Ethereum protocol layer from becoming stagnant. Some people argue that the ice age was only implemented to facilitate the switch to PoS, and is obsolete after the merge. However, PoS is only one of many important planned changes to the base layer and I don't see why L1 governance decisions should become easier after the merge. The ice age is a wonderful tool to enforce active, conscious decisions about protocol changes and improvements. It basically codifies the preference of hardforks over softforks in the Ethereum community, as it removes the possibility of voting no to changes by \"sitting on your ass\".\n\nThe big question to me is, how could an ice age be implemented under PoS? It should slowly (not instantly!) make the chain less usable \u0026 attractive. I see a few possibilities where to start:\n* IA kicking in could decrease the gas limit, so that throughput decreases and the chain becomes more and more expensive to use\n* IA kicking in could probabilistically invalidate more and more block proposal slots, similar results as above\n* IA kicking in could increase slot times. Simple as a concept, but probably hairy in the details due to the implicit assumption of currently perfectly regular 12s slots.",
