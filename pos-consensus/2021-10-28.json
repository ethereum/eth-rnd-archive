        "content": "Any talks on adding a term premium to the staking reward?\nTotal reward unchanged (no impact on supply) but split would be different, function of the term of the stake (e.g.: spot, 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, 12M - similar to money market tenors) with penalties if you unstake before term.\nThis would 1) increase predictability of total staking and 2) is more fair for validators (today the marginal/daily reward for a long term staker vs. an opportunistic staker is the same). Another application would be to derive a layer0 Ethereum Yield Curve.",

        "content": "Although evenly spread out rewards are important from a decentralization point of view, overall the question that drives PoS (dis)incentives/rewards \"does this increase the security provided to Ethereum\". This is contrary to the popular belief that staking is there to make validators rich 😉\nThere already is an entry/exit queue to limit turnover, so I'm not sure how rewarding long-term stakers more would provide greater security. Both types of stakers put up 32 ETH no?",
