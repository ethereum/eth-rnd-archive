        "content": "v0.9.2 Honest validator guide states:\n\u003e `get_committee_assignment` should be called at the start of each epoch to get the assignment for the next epoch `(current_epoch + 1)`. A validator should plan for future assignments by noting at which future slot they will have to attest and joining the committee index attestation subnet related to their committee assignment.\n\nThere can be the case when reorg involving `previous_epoch` occurs right after assignment gets computed. If this reorg affects `randao_mix` then calculated committee will be incorrect. It potentially breaks aggregation as effectively validators of the same committee will be spread across different subnets. On the chain layer it results in validator attesting as a part of incorrect committee.",
