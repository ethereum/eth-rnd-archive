        "content": "I think the explorer counts as vote whenever an attestation for this block appears in other blocks. The typical situation would be this\n```\nN \u003c- N+1\n```\nDuring `N` validators vote for it and they are included in `N+1`, now the next block appears and does\n```\nN \u003c- N+1\n\\_________ N+2\n```\nAnd includes again the same attestations that were included in `N+1`. I think in this case the explorer counts this attestations twice. \n\nOn top of this, validators are allowed to include multiple times the same attestations in blocks, they are just worthless, they give nothing to the proposer nor the attester. We recently received a report that Prysm may be including twice the same attestations in some cases after 32 slots, so this would also contribute to this.",

        "content": "1. In case of a fork as:\n```N \u003c- N+1\n\\_________ N+2\n```\nI understood that the 64 committees assigned for the blocks N+1 and N+2 are disjoint. So there will be no common votes.\n\n2. For validators being allowed to include multiple attestations, how does that work? Will the validator (or maybe case the proposer)  include aggregated BLS signature of one committee (say A) as well as also include another aggregated signature that includes some members of A again?",
