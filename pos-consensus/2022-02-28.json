        "content": "It's worth noting that the sqrt(x) method doesn't provide greater returns to early stakers because they're *early*, instead it's because there are fewer stakers. If validator count drops down (e.g. after withdrawals are enabled or mass slashing), then the returns will rise again, encouraging more validators. This adds some stability to the security (in Ether, and hence $).\n\nI think Sushiswap initially biased early LPs with a cut from future LP fees, though I'm not sure. The coordination barrier was to move funds over initially to support the new pools such that there'd be enough liquidity to cater for swaps to further attract liquidity (e.g. reach a stable point). \n\nFor comparison, 'genesis validators' (present when beaconchain launched) don't receive any special rewards.",
