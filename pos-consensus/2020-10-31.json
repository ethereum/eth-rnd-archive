        "content": "sorry if it was unclear. by individual attestations i mean unique votes by individual validators (sometimes a vote is included several times, across several aggregates, in this case it is only counted once). i compare that number to the number of aggregates included in blocks. it tells me how much we save by using the aggregation mechanism versus including each vote individually, since aggregating 100 votes into one aggregate is 1/100th of the space needed to save the same 100 votes individually",
