        "content": "in theory staking 10M eth will already push out 10M other eth on the margin.\n\nmaybe your idea would be less manipulable with an EIP-1559-style proportional controller. the challenge of setting a supply curve though, is that there's no way to know a priori whether X amount of ETH staked is too low or too high (you could have \"target amount staked\" be a \"votable\" parameter like block gas limit, but block gas limit voting has issues already so not sure it's a great idea to emulate). perhaps it's less risky to do it on the downside, e.g. if the amount staked falls too low then we \"overclock\" the block reward up to some limit (which i think we already do, but static in temporal dimension), and then once the stake becomes healthy again we let it go back down, but never lower than what it currently is today",

        "content": "having \"target amount staked\" be \"votable\" does have some appealing theoretical properties such as: since staking rate should generally equilibriate, anyone who isn't first in line to exploit has no incentive from a yield perspective to vote one way or another; they just have price incentive to do whatever is most bullish for ETH price from a security/inflation trade-off perspective",
