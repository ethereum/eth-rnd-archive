        "content": "I think the first paper you linked is also older and less accurate: in point (3) of their strategy they talk about the honest attestations from n+2 competing with the malicious attestations from n+2 but this isn’t necessary because fork choice delays attestations by one slot. So none of the attestations from n+2 influence the head during n+2 which means the contest is between the block from slot n and the delayed re-org block from (n+1) with one extra vote. So the n+1 blocks wins almost every time even with just a single extra vote. All the honest attesters will vote for it in (n+2)",
