At slot N+2, if a proposer tried to build on the parent of what the head of the chain was at N instead of the block built at N+1, the N+2 proposer is very likely not going to be able to garner support for this fork because attestations for C1 already exist so everyone during N+2 is going to see C1 as the rightful head and keep voting on it",
