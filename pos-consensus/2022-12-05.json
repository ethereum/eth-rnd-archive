This behaviour should also be enough in order to create FFG competitive block, of course, enforcing a block that bumps justification to be a part of the chain has better guarantees.\n\nBtw, we're at attestation block capacity in the best case when doing a reorg. If a reorged block carried old attestations they may not be included in some circumstances.",
