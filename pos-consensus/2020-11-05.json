        "content": "So I came across an interesting edge case while running a node for mainnet, we requested a lot more data from our eth1 node. Main reason is because we use the spec's block time for our calculations, while the actual block time in mainnet is actually 1 second less. \nhttps://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime\nThe last time it was 14 seconds was nearly 2 years ago, does anyone have any opposition to changing this down to 13 seconds in the spec ?\n\nEDIT:\nNvm , it completely flew past my head that the release candidate has already been merged. We can just handle this internally.",
