        "content": "when running the beacon chain protocol, there are certain cases when you're behind on blocks (for example during an internet outage and no peers connected) and have to figure out what to do: produce blocks, validate etc.. seemingly, the \"best\" thing you can do is keep running the protocol, meaning you produce for your own validators and use empty slot transitions to figure that out.. once you reconnect, you'll resync with others, start tallying and in theory, since you weren't finalizing locally, you should be able to reach a stable point by syncing with the others. here's the issue though: for how long do you replay empty blocks? eventually, the empty block processing will cause enough validators to be ejected, and things break down (because committees become empty etc). we could put an arbitrary limit on it but it would be... arbitrary. thoughts?",
