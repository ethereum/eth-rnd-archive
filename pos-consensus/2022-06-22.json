I think the question is not if the chain *could progress* if 51% of validators are honest but rather if it *will progress*. But yeah, it has become a matter of the definition of *advancing* by which we may not agree on the same one. For *livenes* that Jim mentions, the original Buterin-Griffith '17 add the word *plausible* which is key here. The main point of that is that if there's a network split or an outage, indeed the network can continue and when the split is resolved or the offline validators come online they can take from this continued chain and finalize it. So this protects the network from having less than 66% honest validators (say 51% as in the original comment) and zero dishonest. But it does not protect us from having 51% honest and 49% dishonest",
