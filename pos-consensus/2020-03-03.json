It is much safer to be backwards-lenient (because you know when to stop request) than forward-lenient (you need to deduce from blocks).\n\u003e (By backwards lenient, I mean a client that sends you a head after your fork epoch but with the previous fork version... you know you are safe up to the fork epoch)\n\nThat makes sense to me being backward lenient, we can keep peers around till certain fork epochs/blocks and then disconnect with them when the time is right",
