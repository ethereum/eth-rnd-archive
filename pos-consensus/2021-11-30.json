        "content": "Are there any thoughts on the issue of incorrect head votes overwhelming correct head votes due to their prevalence?\n\nI was tracking down the issue of an attestation not being included on-chain, and ran in to block 2619611.  This block knows what the correct head should be, of course, but 86 of the attestations in it, including all of the first 78, have an incorrect head vote.  These were, in general, majority participation in the committees.  Other aggregates were non-overlapping attestations for the same incorrect head.  This resulted in there not being enough space in the block for the correct attestation.\n\nIt is highly frustrating to be excluded from the chain for having the temerity to be correct.  The obvious strategy becomes following with whatever the majority decides, especially with the relatively poor aggregation performance we are seeing at current and the consequent risk of being excluded when you demur to the majority regardless of their accuracy.  But this strategy is antagonistic to both other validators and the chain as a whole.\n\nI don't see a rebalancing of vote weights being enough to address this issue, unfortunately.  And there is obvious value to the chain in including many attestations with correct target votes over a few attestations with correct head and target votes.\n\nI wonder if the target and head votes should be separate attestations and aggregated independently.",
