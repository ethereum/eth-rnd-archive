        "content": "Is it for DoS protection that we use a \"private\" randomised aggregator selection mechanism (i.e. `slot_signature % (len(committee) / N) == 0`)? I was discussing an alternate strategy with \u003c@!203220829473996800\u003e where the first N validators of the committee act as aggregators. This would avoid the problem with the current scheme where sometimes nobody will be selected as an aggregator (the probability is quite small, but when I crunched it with \u003c@!498009160982724610\u003e a while back, I think we realised it occurs something like once every 100 days for high validator counts).\n\nThe advantage of the current scheme seems to be that nobody knows the aggregators in advance (until the aggregator broadcasts their aggregate), and can't try to DoS them? Whereas in the shuffling-based approach, they would be known 2 epochs in advance, and vulnerable for that period\n\nAnything else we're missing that gives the private random approach an edge over the failsafe shuffling-based approach?",
