        "content": "Regarding swagger vs markdown; we surveyed a few future downstream projects and the majority preferred strongly typed schema over loose definitions. Additional feedback we received was that eth1 API implementations often had fragmentation where some clients implimented some features where others didn't or it was under a different path. \n\nWe put a lot of effort, time, and careful thinking into these API schema. We'd be happy to move under github.com/ethereum or have the new repo mirror the schema in markdown if that is preferred for a plain text overview.",

        "content": "I agree that practically all consumers will prefer a strongly typed definition, I certainly would. The reason I was starting from the loosely-typed one is so it’s easy to maintain during spec updates over the following phases and so it can be relevant to gRPC and HTTP. My thinking is that we can create strongly-typed Swagger implementations tied to the markdown API + spec version, at significant checkpoints, whenever we want.\n\nI’m down to incorporate your works and I certainly didn’t mean to discard them (I used them for reference). It just appeared to me that they’re primarily in protobuf, while I was primarily trying to define an HTTP api (as per previous discussions). I figured you could add your input via the PR. \n\nHow do you want to move forward with including your works? Do you agree with trying to define a minimal set of endpoints first, or do you just want to make a big PR with everything in it? My preference is to start minimal because we get more eyes on the PR, less contention and it’s becomes more likely to have full coverage from clients.",
