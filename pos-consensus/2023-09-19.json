        "content": "Small question about what happens when validators are ejected at the ejection balance during a non-finality situation - It seems to me that the ejection should immediately remove the low balance validators from the active set, similar to a slashing, and then the ejected validators would have to go through the exit queue where they would continue to bleed out. That would restore finality fairly quickly. \n\nOr, is it that the ejected validators continue to be part of the active set, and are simply in the queue to exit waiting for removal? If that is the case, if the participation rate is low enough (say the current situation on the first attempt at holesky), finality is never  gotten back because *all validators* eventually hit the ejection balance?",
