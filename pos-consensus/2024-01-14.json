Is there a built-in mechanim or reason why a validator with a lot of stake would choose to put it all in one validator instead of spreading it out to mitigate the risks from, say, an inactivity leak? I know operational costs could be considered a disincentive to do this, but it also provides an added level of safety",

        "content": "Would it make sense to change the inactivity leak such that larger validators are penalized the same, at least at the start, as smaller validators, to ensure that the risk of running everything through one validator instance is not greater than fragmenting?
