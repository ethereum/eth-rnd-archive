[link](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#justification-and-finalization)\n\nThe weighting for attestations does not include active_slashed validators (`get_attesting_balance`)\nbut it compares it to the total balance that includes slashed validators. (`get_total_active_balance`)\n\nAm I missing something? I don't see why `active_slashed` validators get to contribute (negatively) to the voting weight of non-slashed validators?\ne.g. if 1/3 of total balance weight is `active_slashed` validators we can't justify a new checkpoint.",
