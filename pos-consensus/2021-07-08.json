        "content": "For the altair minimal spec we have `SYNC_COMMITTEE_SIZE: 32`.  Is it possible to put this back to mainnet size (512) before devnets go live?\n\nReason for keeping it the same as mainnet is two-fold.  Primarily, it makes it more likely that small testnets will encounter the situation where the same validator has multiple sync committee duties for a single period.  Secondarily, it makes life easier for those of us who have to deal with fixed-size arrays in Go with struct annotations (not sure if this applies to other languages as well).",
