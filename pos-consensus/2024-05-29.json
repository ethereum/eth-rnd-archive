Mostly still on the posts https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825 and https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751. There is an ongoing ROP here but nothing to report yet: https://efdn.notion.site/ROP-11-The-stake-supply-curve-and-future-staking-economy-65bc0802f5814d91bd11f3207b232008?pvs=4. Our team is working on something related (penalties capping) and we hope to release something by end of June. There are also talks at conferences, e.g., this one: https://x.com/dappcon_berlin/status/1793351670920868296",
