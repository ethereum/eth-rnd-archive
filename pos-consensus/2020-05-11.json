Taking a look at the REST APIs here: https://ethereum.github.io/eth2.0-APIs/#/Validator/get_validator_duties__epoch__attester\n\nI am curious how frozen those are?  Specifically I'm looking at the `validator_pubkeys` which is submitted via a URL parameter.  Curerntly it is expected to be a single parameter, with multiple public keys encoded as an array with `,` as separators.  Given that url parameters can be provided multiple times, it seems cleaner to have them just be submitted individually\n\n- current: `/validator/duties/\u003cepoch\u003e/attester?validator_pubkeys=key1,key2,key3`\n- what I'm proposing: `validator/duties/\u003cepoch\u003e/attester?validator_pukkey=key1\u0026validator_pubkey=key2\u0026validator_pubkey=key3`\n\nThe benefit of this approach is that web frameworks, both server and client will handle this natively.  The current approach requires both client and server to do a little bit of extra parsing/validation.",
