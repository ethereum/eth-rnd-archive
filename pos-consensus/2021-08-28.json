        "content": "Just to reiterate that there is no ETH 2.0. There will be many upgrades, big and small, over the next few years. \nNot sure if there is a complete write-up of _all_ changes, but https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs contains a \"Merge\" section listing the changes over on the consensus side.\nThe initial merge will be very basic, and just swapping out the consensus protocol. Block building is still done by the execution layer client (geth/nethermind/besu/etc, that talk to each other broadcasting transactions). But to figure out what the current head is, the execution client defers to the consensus client.\nWhen a validator has to propose, it can ask the execution client to build it a block to include. See the link above.",
