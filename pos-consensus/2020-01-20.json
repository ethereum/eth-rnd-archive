Agree that if slashers are working properly rewards will tend to 0 (user error and software bugs notwithstanding).\n\nGiven this, it seems unlikely that most small-scale validators will bother to run slashers.  Perhaps the answer is for a number of organisations to run slashers, and be known to be doing so, such that it's clear the network is protected.  If/when slashing is detected by these organisations the information will be broadcast to allow proposers to benefit, and to validate that slashing detection is active.  The organisations will take the hit of the cost of running the slasher against the benefit to them of the network being protected.\n\nLarger organisations involved with Ethereum 2 will want to do this because it enhances the security of the network, in which they are heavily invested.  The Ethereum Foundation is an obvious organisation to run such a service.  I'd be up for running another (as Attestant) and I'm sure we could find a few others around the globe who'd be interested in doing likewise.\n\nOf course, none of this stops anyone else from running their own slasher but it means they should not feel obligated to do so, either because they think the network will be insecure or because they think they may miss out on potential income.",
