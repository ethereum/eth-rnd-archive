And governance issues are explicitly not allowed in this server, so I'll stick to the technical part on how to implement an ICE age. I think PoS allows for a few more variants that weren't there in PoW. Randomly declaring more and more blocks invalid could be very complicated to implement cause you'll have to reinclude transactions and the execution and consensus layers are weakly coupled after the merge. I think changing block time is really hard to implement for clients since clock sync is one of the foundations of the networking stack of PsS. One thing that can be done is to require more and more consecutive justified epochs to declare one to be finalized. This way you can delay finalization without really changing execution at all. Then parties will have to either go back and resort to number of blocks to confirm transactions (knowing that is cheaper in PoS for some players to actually have long chains without them being finalized) or pressure devs to get back to work",
