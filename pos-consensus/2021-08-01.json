The only thing that actually matters is the total issuance that needs to be optimized over time to be the minimum needed to maintain security. The only worry with the source timely flag to me is that it is one of the points where existing validators may start loosing rewards (compared to what they were earning before). As we are sure to see less performance after the merge, and currently they get the source reward for free.",
