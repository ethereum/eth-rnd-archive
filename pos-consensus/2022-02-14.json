        "content": "Just to add: specifically in the case of Rocket Pool, it's true that if hypothetically a single operator could put up 33% of all staked ETH and the protocol could match it then that operator would control 2/3rds of all validators, but the relevant comparison to mining pools is with the Rocket Pool network *as a whole* -- not a single operator. Even if Rocket Pool comprised 66% of all validators there would be no single party able to direct those validators to finalize a particular fork because Rocket Pool is a significantly decentralized protocol.",
