The thing is that if there is not general consensus on the prior epoch (no justification and two viable forks maybe due to latency, maybe due to some network partition), then the proposer (and entire committee shuffling for that matter) for slot `N` on each fork will almost certainly be different in most cases.",

        "content": "You are right in noting that these scenarios are tough to come up with and that the fork choice is generally very stable. The most forking we expect in non-attack scenarios is due to latency and proposer at `N + 1` not seeing the block built at `N` and thus building on some block `\u003c N`",
